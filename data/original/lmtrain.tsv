Dv cus it‚Äôs playful doggos
It's interesting, if this was about invasive food smells in an apartment this conversation probably wouldn't be happening.
I fucking change my mind, something wonderful has happened! Please don't make me go dead, tomorrow.
You should probably use that time to make a decent argument not the other thread then, I'm just going to leave you here .
Cut your nalis, i hate it
Thank you kindly! I'll update my resume!
Doesn't change too much. A delayed bribe would still be a bribe.
Haha, yes.
Oh wow Thats definitely something

You should really contact an immigration lawyer.
Thank you. Very very much
Mad at [NAME] for what she consensually agreed to
These are lovely, I have one.
But you have about 0% chance of winning the lottery and the lottery isn't determined by your effort, skill, etc. 
Broken. Good and grtting better.
Bad sarcasm in response to a bad joke seems about right to be fair.
Me too and you made me feel better because I thought I couldn't keep up due to being old lol.
That's why imo [NAME] death is better.
I agree. I've been passively thinking that the left and right axis is irrelevant. Its north and south that divides
that's why im here in the overwatch university subreddit you fucking idiot.
ET + 2 picks for [NAME] would be great
No that's communism not socialism. There's a difference between them.
Then I would just be like you owe me two sodas
HEY BEAUTIES ITS ME SASHA VELOUR
Why would they lie?
He‚Äôs jackin‚Äô him off! Giving him the Bolton Special no doubt.
Insecurities exist even for people that are attractive. Even hot people are just like everyone else.
Except it destroyed 76% of America's scooby snack production. May Shagster have mercy on us all.
We‚Äôve bombed plenty of innocent people. How is it any different?
This is the first time in the last two years I've seen somebody compare current politics to a series other than Harry Potter
I know that feeling man
I'm scared that they would turn out like me, even if I tried really hard to make them nice. 
:^(
[NAME] has gotta he replaced or that was just terrible writing
The first half is able to run on the momentum of being stupid fun, the second half falls apart really quick.
It's much more common in English than in German, weirdly enough.
Still don‚Äôt know how [NAME] said him and [NAME] will be battling for years while keeping a straight face.
Tell me about it. Talk about evil icecream haha
Please stop talking [NAME].
Would someone even be able to pursue a diagnosis for type 2 if they already suffer from type 1?
Thanks! Having a look.
What are those baby blue thingies?
Safety Dance in Naxxramas, WOTLK. My favorite boss fight to date
He is but he's a normie. A 2/10 would be treated like a pariah at a dance class.
Awesome; two steps back then one forward; so many big devs these days.
Ahhhhh you should start screaming and flailing. What a piss poor argument. Now I believe in invisible dragons.
That's honestly what I thought too!!
Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!
We are currently working with Crypto Capital while their legal team is trying to get the funds from this bank.
Watching it deteriorate into a horrific dystopia. Healthcare costs. Dental. Low wages.
Mail Call, great show, have all of 'em preserved for history. RIP

She better not die
It is not selfish to end a relationship that is causing you great stress and you feel is over despite loving them.
My earliest memory is being in a wooden crib and my mom screaming in my face at the top of her lungs. It didnt end there.
Dude is really nice. But I‚Äôm gonna be so upset if we ignore our huge need for a small forward again.
Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.
That reminds me of this
I'm pretty sure the IT guy was instructed to put the site down with not much more instructions.
She is too
All of Disney is cringey. It needs to be stopped

He is the best
with a locker room like this is looking to be, I don't think Ohio State is done losing games that they shouldn't
This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
Agreed, probs an older brother. Source: am an older brother
Wow, the video is a lot worse than I thought. His actions after he asks for the age is very uncomfortable. 
That‚Äôs pretty awesome :)
Does he have to be so anal about his rep? At least he's (in)famous. *Awesome job, OP!*
Don't forget [NAME] being nerfed because she was unfun to play against in QM, then being reworked, then being nerfed again for the same reason.
When you stop making garbage takes, I'll stop correcting them
In a sous vide? How does that work?
I've long completed everything I can and spent all my fight money. No Kage for me
Especially if you're looking for the Linux or Mac versions (which exist for a large portion of Steam games).
Think he's trying to put pressure on him to accept a pay cut.
Doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs going to work out, sorry dude
Hmm surprised that went on for as long as it did, at some point there must have been some redeeming qualities. 
one of my all time favorite episodes i even love the closing animation of them crossing the bridge out of the
I am removing this post because of sourcing. Read the sidebar.
[NAME] I love college football just because of these wild plays where coaches and players go all out to win it
I hate it when mom and dad fight.
If you'd like to suggest an alternative non-inflammatory metaphor for something that implies racism, I'm happy to consider it. 
Most of them keep it on the down-low, but, yeah, they voted and support [NAME]. Only one of the brother-in-laws didn't vote for him. 
Holy fuck youre pathetic. I hope you have insurance. Therapy is expensive I hear
No one wins if we all die. You'd think that fact would be enough.
This offseason has been so upsetting
Congratulations! I'm sure your shoulders are much lighter now. You look absolutely gorgeous, keep killing it :D
[NAME] was quite anti-Semitic.
This is delusion beyond what I'm willing to engage with.
Yes every time
> [NAME] That is going to get sooo confusing if he does join our division.
Except the ones trying to zipper by flying by everyone just to slam on their breaks to zipper...
One period? Damn you think it would last that long
Your work is amazing! Really like the Rugrat one. The melting style is so cool. Prices are very reasonable for the quality too
My point is that they give him shit for legitimate reasons.
What a poor woman who only wanted to tell someone what to do.
The world needs more Attack of the Killer Tomatoes memes.
i didn't figure 3 or 5 hours would break us up
A surprise to be sure! But a welcome one
You just know he liked his own comment
And based on the film of [NAME] novel *Johnny Got His Gun*, both worth checking out.
Yep, hell of a listener
Wasn‚Äôt this guy floated around as a long shot OC candidate earlier in the offseason?
I had forgotten, now I changed it, thank you very much for warning me about that! so sorry üôè
Lol it's a bit of both I think.
It's weird that many places consider iguanas invasive species..
He was trying to move the gun away so that it wouldn't hurt anyone!!!!.
I wasn't saying it was. But it's the most likely explanation of why a youtuber would want to pretend they have one.
He's a good prospect. Solid enough lineout and scrum, great around the park. Been pushing TPN for starting spot.
No.. that's the exact opposite of what they are.
It‚Äôs my ringtone :)
Only until security finds it stuffed with coke.
Thank you sis!
Depends on what else is going on at the time and the state of Britain economically and globally. But these terms wouldn't currently be popular, no.

Does he report it to the police? I didn't see that part. I believe him. Stranger things have happened.
This is the kind of winning I love. Winning because [NAME] has 25 and [NAME] has 29
And everyone clapped
I want a sense of progression and accomplishment in overwatch, something golden guns and skins dont give me anymore :)
Hm okay. I‚Äôll tell the technician that‚Äôs what I believe it is and do some googling now. Thanks for the quick response!
Love this game, can't stand the combat system. It's just not for me.

I like [NAME] better
DID SOMEONE SAY THE TH WORD!!!!! I HAVE ARRIVED!
Sweet summer child
I don't know if I'm comfortable with a religion that approves of human sacrifice tbh
The intent is to provide the players with a sense of pride and accomplishment...
sorry for the dumb question, but where do the pagers get their signal from? Are there still emitter around or do cellphone towers this job now?
He mustn't know about Mr. [NAME] and the cause of his untimely death.
I genuinely think that would be an iconic shot if it was in a famous horror film. The way the legs just keep on coming is terrifying.
Nah, stick with me, I've got a new angle.
Maybe they are just horrible people, and because you aren't like them they don't like you. 
I can just do it with my eyes open. Is that weird? It kind of hurts.
Get Flonase. This thing work for me.
Soooooo Florida?
Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take.
I love everything I have ever made in mine, but recently it's mostly used to hard boil eggs.
I agree 100%
I want my Thick Blood feat to actually say ‚ÄúF*CK YOU‚Äù every time I deny a Peacekeeper their bleed damage.
Wait, what? [NAME] wasn't allowed a *bank account*?
You‚Äôve obviously never met a kangaroo before
heck
Both teams played fantastically defensively, just because it‚Äôs not a 10 goal game doesn‚Äôt mean anyone played badly. 
just a peep from /r/leagueoflegends here with some popcorn
I wish my phone was that accurate. It warns me I'm at 14%, then 10 minutes later it drops to 0% and shuts off.
What is the protocol for those seeking asylum? Do they get a fast-track to refugee status if their asylum is granted?

I'm sorry but are you implying that everything to the right of full-blown communism is the center?
Omg rattos are the best aren‚Äôt they<3
Love those clips on YouTube, does this add anything to it? Considering Netflix's obsession with exclusivity, this is an unusual arrangement. 
Cool people = Good looking people who had healthy social development.

This is an old carnie trick. There are sites that have debunked this guy.
Baby mama was a comedy about this- but with a much happier ending
And the nerve of that monster to say he wishes the police would have searched his home because she would still be alive..
I just don't like our options in the off season.
Nothing to worry about. 4 inches is fine. You will do well because you are a nice guy.
She shouldn‚Äôt have to fight a male.
I don't understand why this is funny. All of it honestly. She os body shaming [NAME], why should we love that? 
Gold Coast seems like it would go well on paper, but turn up to the actual thing and seems strangely disappointing would be good to tell friends about though
Sidhu Moose Wala. He's pretty big right now

Because Rian is a hack...and TLJ sucks. That's my default response that seems to be the correct answer most often. lol
I agree w that.
Good on you dude. I'm west coast, but I'd love if anyone ever finds themselves in Seattle, I extend this offer.
I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
Thanks for the [NAME] quote.
I think him and [NAME] are gonna start getting similar amount of starts. [NAME] is just finally able to play again after getting hurt earlier.
Weird, just got back from the one on Grand 45 min ago and I got in and out no problem.

I watched that same movie. Very generic Christmas movie but I liked it
Yes, they seem to want open borders. Which is silly. They don‚Äôt want actual border control.
Sorry I am kind of new to posting here. Didn't even know that existed! Gonna try and move over there.
Watch it in German but use English subtitles trust me
I am twice as proud of my baby [NAME].
I mainly play EDH. Did try standard at one point as well but lost interest
I'll continue to be dumb for supporting a company I like. Thanks for your input poor.
Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
No problem, I hope that you are able to accomplish what you wish :)

That's certainly one part of the puzzle, though arguably they are non-noahide as they historically advocated for incest marriage, but maybe it is different now.
I‚Äôve legitimately never heard anything about disabled men relying on prostitution, nor have I heard any arguments using disabled men as a rationalization for prostitution.
Here you go, sis. be warned tho, top cringe.
If Studio MDHR did this, I'd buy it.
yes!!! Once I realized my body wasn't wanting as much food i put my self on intermittent fasting and i love it
No, just illness, as long as it does less harm than good. 
That's crazy. Glad you got your money back though!

Wait, what. Are you okay son? I'm here to talk. 
Dogs get itches every now and then and use the ground to scratch it out. But usually it's on dirt not asphalt.

Pre ordered rather. Reveal was today
You should check out my comment at the bottom of this thread of why I somewhat support antifa. This comic is obviously fearmongering conservatives.
Lowkey lyrics right there, revolution or genocide, it won't be televised. Something like that about [NAME] press
Of course it is. If it's called #bellletstalk. Not #letstalk.
Yeah, my schedule has been brutal for the past 2-3 years. This year it has become my objective to get more involved to get-in with more parents.

Excited for this project to be finished when I retire in 30 something years.

Yup, even if they had a very rough life... Nobody ages thaaaaaat badly.
Even after the initial testing? Thank you!
Burn wait someone already did it sorry
Slick passing!
I figured that‚Äôs a British thing. Is that not a British thing?
[NAME] consistently being the guy with most energy. We need him on the floor more.
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre safe now and nothing bad happened!
Man. I wanna be there to see his face! It‚Äôd be great. ü§£
Big words coming from a guy who only talks about [NAME]
Not the fact that it's a terrible comparison?
Absolutely this is the kind of absolute hypocrisy that made me leave the church!
Ugh, I want to have his baby too...
how'd you get into my brain???
Our road still hasn‚Äôt been salted on Troy Hill
Also I've heard she owns a bag.
I have faith
Nope. I'd rather they fix their servers instead.
Thank you [NAME] for helping us keep our wisdom!
"Yeah the only ""compromise"" is get married ASAP so you can have sex again (which is a HORRIBLE idea)."
>We had a bunch in the prequels (which also suck, please stop giving them too much credit salt miners). It's treason then. 
That would be a huge mistake on WWEs part.

No, I have to make money somehow, I‚Äôm not doing more than Mom dies of polio before getting in a relationship,
Cheers, I enjoyed your announcers. Sucks we don't get to play again until next year
You sound quite childish and unable to engage with any information that doesn‚Äôt conform to your narrative. Sad.
Just till the end of the month as they're doing work on the rail.
Yep! And the buns seemed so much fresher then. Last time I went, years ago, it was terribly disappointing.
They'd probably need to take nutrients by IV until their organs are working normally again. But yes it should be possible to save a starving person
At least was fun i guess Thx [NAME], thx [NAME]
Why thank you :)
Yep exactly, and he never demands the ball as well. He's afraid of it.
You dirty scavenger
My anger, up 50%. 
It's so if people search for feminism his post will show up and he gets the attention he craves

That is the stuff of nightmares...seriously.
You will love Happy People! Perfect to watch when you're snowed/iced in.
Thanks for reminding me not to have kids
The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed. 
Yeah I can't imagine who wouldn't want to come out first to such a supportive friend
Free to be fucked
Alright, thanks. I appreciate you taking your time to explain that to me. 
What a disgusting pair of human beings, if you can even call them that

"Ok I was wondering thank you I seen alot of different ""opinions"" on it ."
Aw look at her little coat
My husband was cracking when I looted [NAME]. Dude kept $100 in his pocket just to go to the bathroom
I ASSURE YOU WE'RE OPEN
You're delusional and unabashedly willing to lie about others for ideological reasons.
This is the best quote I have ever read on reddit.
first of all calm down. second
Unless he was lying about his age, no.
you're just pretending you dont know what this cartoon is about, it's utterly ridiculous. 
Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
That's hilarious.
I LOVE THIS TEAM
Can someone post [NAME] before picture I'm curious now
Shit out to my little hommies who's parents made them go to school today.
"If she is sorry at all. Could be more along the lines of ""I am pretending to be sorry so I don't get fired."""

That was the middle school dream
17f CF to the core here. I never thought of having kids once in my life! No kids for me
Fuck the White House, fuck McDonald‚Äôs and fuck this post.
You lost me at dogs.
Hello! [NAME] is beautiful but I‚Äôve only been once. I never had the whisky so I can‚Äôt even argue haha.
The wilderbeast only hit muscles so they patches her up, cleabed the wound and gave her antibiotics
Can we reply to the Yankees being cheap directly, any time Yankees Twitter posts something new now? 
And you can amend a tax return. She can‚Äôt amend a terrible life choice like that.
it's quite cruel and a little late for him to be worried about hurting her
Oh so it's more like r/im14andnothingisdeep
Prison is for poor people. No point in stopping someone from being productive
Wow now I know there's a twist. Why even watch it?
Great to hear something positive for once! Was half expecting a negative rant. Yay for [NAME] and congrats to you.
I love my Red Wings because they're incredibly stylish and I still feel like I could stomp a mudhole in somebody's ass
[NAME] is phenomenal. It‚Äôll be a sad day once he‚Äôs gone
I don't think [NAME] is on the cast list for Episode IX, so I doubt Phasma will be coming back again.
Damn this sounds like a former friend of mine. She doesn‚Äôt get instant validation on things and flips out. Cut negative people out OP.
Hunting would at least be more rewarding and fun. Every time I wanna meal prep in RDO I just horseback ride and lock-on to deer.
Talk to his parents maybe if that's an option. Just tread gently.
Perhaps not a mainline souls game, but you can't deny the similarities to Soulsborne games. It's basically an iteration on the formula. 
If you‚Äôre talking about ÁéõÈõÖ, I checked and they‚Äôre permanently closed. It‚Äôs a shame since the location would have been perfect.
I thought this was about [NAME] from Melbourne bc of the flair, until I started reading it. 
i find it a little disgusting if swear words are used frequently and unironically.
I'm fucking starving here.
Also why we only get two Senators per state.
[NAME] thats real? I'm so glad i unsubbed from pics
Your username sort of checks out? Lol
Ok but who‚Äôs gonna take one for the team and make their flair ‚Äúeats Xanax and moves on‚Äù

This is awesome! do you have any more artwork on a website or social site? Is this for sale!?
Waze is owned by google, so I'm not sure what you mean by that. Unless you just mean they are both sharing the same routing algorithm.
For me it's more about making my personal appearance a hobby more than just buying expensive stuff to have it
It is funny and sad, when faced with the option to laugh or cry I choose laugh
Just reading this makes me sick
I love my audio technica AR3BT
I need the band name on his hoodie for, professional reasons!
Great movie whose marketing did an awful job of preparing people for.
Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this comment. I really dislikes the Facebook type posts on this sub.
So I've never seen [NAME] before and decided to Google it out of curiosity... Cheers for that
Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.
Hey guys, it doesn't offend Uncle [NAME] here. Nothing to see, then. Guess we better move on...
Also, this clip seems to be as deceptively-edited as the one [NAME] put forward at the beginning of this entire mess.
...and?
Hey good news it works! I'd shove it in your ass and show you :)
There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
Awesome, thanks. Great answer.
I'm not sure what you are implying, but it seems very rude.
Funny how you're implying he'd even have a chance against [NAME]
v0.1.2 should have multiple versions, one of which preserves 1RN. Additional info on the linked page.
This must have been pre Make Believe. From what I gather, [NAME] doesn't even take tylenol anymore 
Oh, [NAME]!
No, but we have beer and whiskey 
Narcissistic people sometimes convince family members of that. It's a form of controlling people who would otherwise leave.
Yes of mine worry, no one liked mine either. 
Never lost one. The black one just got trampled on a dance floor and it stopped hitting.
I'm really proud of you for standing up yourself like that!
So I have a hobby, I'm passionate about my 2nd Amendment rights, and I dont post/comment on reddit often. Your point?
My biggest pet peeve is blown saves.
So we're the 2nd richest team.
[NAME] get your racial and gender slurs straight!
Imagine being upset over who someone loves.
which grind gives you the right to cheat on your girlfriend ? lmao
The final boss must be a girl who doesn't want to be his queen
This post is about a strung out homeless traveler who abandoned his dog. Are you confused about things?
Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.
people be sleeping on greens fastball sheesh
2 is washed out, 6 and 10 are too dark. Also imgur showed me a bald naked chimpanzee right after your last picture and I nearly choked. 
Honestly, I love hearing about stories like this - like the multitude of Skyrim and Oblivion mod developers who eventually got hired by studios due to their work.
The feeling of betrayal could be one of the worse pains ever. Hope one day this will pass man.
What's there to disagree on..... it's pretty apparent
Nah, he's much smarter than I am about soccer.
I know, I'm training. Only a semi-cursed word with a number as the user seems coincidental.
Hello. We have removed your comment for shaming. Thanks [NAME]
I miss [NAME]
Ha! I like that one.
I had season seats in 230 row 2 for a solid 5 years when the Pru just opened. Great view of the ice. Glad you had fun!
It still baffles me how they cover for him, and his trace amounts, when they‚Äôre in his body because he cheated in the first place.
That's the best line in the entire show for me.
[NAME] gets punched in the head and gets a penalty.
Yes, [NAME] is truly evil [NAME], his utter failure and stupidity is so beyond reason that when you mention it, it sounds beyond reason.
TIL [RELIGION] are the second biggest religious group in Arizona...I'm starting to see why it's been red for so long.
Doesn't change the fact that they shadowbanned a subreddit. Just because YOU think it's stupid doesn't make that ok.
Obviously, it was a humorous comment. But I'm pretty sure I can guess what you voted :P
The BBQ ranch and Greek are my favorites!!
I STILL WANT CREW ONLY LOBBIES
What do you think is an unacceptable percentage level?

That's gonna be a no from me dawg.

You are. And so am I.
Not if he signs it. And he has made statements that contradict the 2nd amendment in the past.
Yeah, and there's no better way to make a market more competitive than to regulate it more...
I think you mean the announcement

I love the way he starts kicking the guy while holding the 2 Ak's
I don‚Äôt understand how her parents were able to take kid when she claims they are horrible alcoholics
maybe they need Congress to pass a bill to make the music softer than the dialogue
Awh you're hurt
Awesome! I just read Bad Blood and have been waiting for a documentary about it.
Someone committed enough at causing mayhem could just use bolt cutters. The point is to stop kids/random curious people.
We, battered UT fans, thank you.
Yeah, I do. I'm just pretty sure that that will fuck my heart eventually. But I'll worry about that later.
I discovered this show on the cnn docuseries about the nineties. What a terrible idea for a show üòÇüòÇ
This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù this is a company.
Simply explain the situation as you did here, don‚Äôt use any cliches or anything just be honest about it.
Reporters shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of governments - governments should be afraid of reporters.
22 points in 41 games with a pretty shitty Utica squad, first full year in NA... yeah I don‚Äôt want another Dahlen debacle 
Way too tired for work today so taking the day off. Feels pretty great!
The level of denial the top boys reached was astonishing.
Your using emotionl blackmail. Does the vet save cancer or destroy cancer? [NAME] = Vet. Your using babies and all sorts of things to manipulate. Vets only do the right thing.
Hopes we all get so sick of his messages we'll vote for him to outlaw them. Courageous strategy Mr [NAME]
Lol I‚Äôd love to.
A friend calls this shadow work. I think you're right. It takes a lot of courage and persistence.
The applause came from [NAME] and his group.
I live downtown and walk around at odd hours of the night all the time. Love the empty and abandoned feel of the city.
Come on vocabulary
[NAME] looks rushed on his 3's tonight for no reason
This is the truest statement I‚Äôve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.
> Ottoman
I, too, can use patronizing terms of endearment with a perfect stranger on the Internet, cupcake ;)
who's to late?
That‚Äôs awesome. They did it on purpose.
So cute!
I've been a Rams fan since the first Rams vs Pats!
Sure, let's kill a guy with a buck on his horse because that's how it was in the old west. Smh
It's more laid back, which I kinda love.
As of right now, [NAME] is the better overall player.
It was not my ex, I just watched her in action.
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs from when she was abused when she was pregnant and lost the baby.
Excellent as always
I sold an item on ebay and amazon at the same time. I had to cancel the Amazon order. Is that going to hurt anything?
Want to relay that in a coherent message?
I would love to know why you think it's awful advice!
Again it's weed not heroin. Smoke it. Or sell it.
LMFAOOOOO that‚Äôs when family guy was still funny
... and we are still in the EU ! ... [NAME] help us when we leave !
No need for pity! It was a happy moment. Tears of joy not sadness
Omg, I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love. That's horrible. :/ Are you doing okay?
The irony of you guys using an American website created because of capitalism is funny
I thought the Generals were due!!
In my experience it was just people burning the fuck out of popcorn (possibly to cover up the stench of weed) at 2am
Thank you, you are blessed
Would the state be effected by the federal shut down? I‚Äôm not sure how far reaching the shut down is.
Go for it, it will be a new experience it may not go good but you'll learn someway 
Oh geez.
I‚Äôm gonna put my soul glow on now.
They started seeling alcohol a while ago, when she called her mafia friend to get help for the speakeasy.
Why is sleeping with a coworker such a big problem for a news network? It‚Äôs not the military with a rank disparity or something

what does this mean?
"This whole episode is one of my favorites; it has this AND ""Requiem for a Tuesday"" AND ""the Low-Cal Calzone Zone"" "
Where? Sorry, the link doesn't seem to work!
That's not the plan. If it were, the backstop wouldn't be controversial. The plan is divergence.
Season 2 just started and as a huge TNG fan I can definitely say the first season is the closest I've ever seen to another season of TNG
So precious! Thanks for sharing Give me animals pics over human babies any day~

Dr [NAME] is the best! :)
Or at least it could have been, but the pic is gone :(
I don't think that's a normal marriage because my husband has never said those kinds of things to me (20 years now)
that would‚Äôve tasted a lot better
there's no ventilation shafts in the dumb things, block the exits and make a bonfire.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!!! Thank you.
The username oh god I'm having violent flashbacks
I'm already a member :[NAME] Already posted it there too.

Never knew that, explains why she was working so hard for the banks all this time.
I like the sound of that, shes definitely a bitch what does chutzpah mean?

MR. STEAL YO' GIRL!
Saddle up, partner.
I get why you hate this guy, but why do you hate [NAME]?
You‚Äôre wrong. Source: I looked before I commented the first time.
Ooh, the pupil proportion was wonderful at this time.
Happy New Year.
It was like fifteen minutes old, I doubt that many individual people cared to click in the first place. Also different account names kept responding.
Probably it is a lot less memorable for those rich guys since they eat this type of stuff so often it stops being a special experience altogether.
Why do you say this? I'm genuinely curious.
[NAME] just got to slide into Chef Bois DMs

For real! So happy they just put season 2 on hulu
Yes. We're finishing the script out now. Shooting starts in February.
Haha I was thinking Utah but... Florida makes sense too. There‚Äôs a few crazy states ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ad hominem. Ridiculous argument, not even funny or hilarious.
Maybe I‚Äôm out of touch, but I see 22-14-6 and think that is typically a playoff caliber record.
Yes! I play both, because I like the combat of one and everything else in the other.
"*""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.""* -- [NAME]"
Most likely. If he falls to our 3rd round pick ,I think we should definitely take him.
"You offered her the wrong ""services"" /s (obviously I hope)"
I wonder if this will ever appear on BotW. Since it's so straightforward there probably isn't much to talk about.
Imagine trying to step down from there after you're done and your legs feel like rubber
I love the wire, never sad any thing bad about it just that it's from two decades ago
[NAME] is so cute ^_^, the second bunny image is my favourite. Since you haven't got any requests... I request Himiko.
It is true. But the real reason for the problem is the selfishness of the people.
Wow, who can afford this one? 
>but part of the whole inequality picture is women receiving lower pay for the same jobs. Honestly? Doesn't happen.
trashy comment.
"Call me a [NAME] but I love saying that word. ""No."""
Welp that was inconsiderate of those who had to suffer. Should of gone home and showered, then head back to the gym.
I'm about 5 weeks of NC after a 1 yr relationship. It gets better. Occupy and work on yourself.
[NAME] holding grudges
Nice try Mommy shark
Personally really enjoyed it. Have it in my top 3 AC games with AC2 and Black Flag in there too.
Nah you're fine. This is why all sou-chefs are heathen
Wow thanks. Could have sworn the Score app was showing 3pm when I checked it two days ago.
Thanks for not declaring that in a karma whory way like so many of your fellow fans
So air doesn't move if your hand isn't faster then speed? I doubt that.
Uh... [NAME] team was playing vs Chichatronco's one?
I would of at least helped the poor guy. Throw some fire crackers at the dam thing
Actually [NAME] had the #1 PP who bazooka [NAME] fired lol
It‚Äôs ok. We forgive you
Yes he is. Cling to your safety blanket for now cause momma [NAME] is about to snatch it from you.
Wow really? I watched a fair bit of KR Contenders. I guess I just wasn‚Äôt paying that much attention.
There always seems to be some genuine dislike of [NAME] whenever [NAME] talks about him.
Yeah buh idk. I‚Äôd have to be really horny too and I‚Äôm really shy and anxious around him.
Not significantly bigger. UK is approximately the same size in terms of land mass as Romania right? Which isn't significantly bigger than Syria.
Funny how some people criticize people for not following those laws, when they don't either.
[NAME] can stuff it, but I‚Äôll take the disengagement from the Administration for what it is.
It is sad they didn't have a 4k highspeed camera running on this... I feel like the world lost an amazing possibility
That has to be an understatement, I know several myself
if they that lame then disprove them mate.
Sad and very true though. Case in point.
It's so obviously a joke but they took it literally because them thinking it is serious validates their skewed perception of the world.
I think that's a reference to how fucking mad watching [NAME] makes people feel. ie shit [NAME] is playing and now I have the furies!
/u/skyboundIan no spoilers in the trailer pretty please :D
Thanks for the insight
For a moment there I thought I was the only one! Pretty awesome and I had no idea
was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )
[NAME] has 5 goals in 4 games for us doesn‚Äôt he?
I never said it should have been called. I just think it's hilarious that the replay literally shows it.
that's really good
To laugh at the bad memes
Sticking a road in the middle of someone's land just to satisfy your OCD seems pretty cruel.
Why would I do that?
Mr. Steal Yo Perfect Season
Genius. I'm so doing this
Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.
ah, it does me heart good to see NIMBYs in the wild
The pastor they‚Äôre having officiate their wedding is deeply and unabashedly homophobic...the hypocrisy is GLARING.
Honestly, I really liked being 32. The 30s in general have been great. Happy birthday!
Lol, try harder next time bud. Your swearing really shows who is actually mad here and your stupidity is starting to get really grating.
A true internet classic.
Thank you! It sucks but not being a zombie is so worth it!
They look nothing alike.
Not liking [NAME] is not statism. Removed.
He‚Äôs bad
This is awesome. nice!
I mean... if you want we can probably create some existential dread.
"[NAME] isn't facilitating anything between South and North Korea. The only thing he can take credit for is no longer threatening ""fire and fury."""
Really good point here. Thanks.
Love this. Thanks for sharing.
Wow. A relevant and amusing Garfield comic.
Happy Wednesday night brother.
I am scared that I would lose potential study time by seeing him. And worse if I end up liking him too much... :(
Good to know. The little chapel in there is pretty gnarly.
Thank you that‚Äôs sweet of you (:
I dont know this one (new or yet another alt) I can't take people seriously when they have a hidden agenda for these questions
I like [NAME] but I'm gonna have to go with [NAME].
Brilliant movie.
Sorry man. I didn‚Äôt know you were on reddit. Didn‚Äôt mean to steal your stuff! I totally would have tagged you
Yes, you selfish prick. 
Aw crap you're right. Sorry I suck at names and shit
Omg this made me laugh!
Now you‚Äôre repeating yourself. Boy bye #wasteoftime. Have fun trying to call this company and their products bunk when everyone loves them haha
I hope you both enjoy it!
Perfect, thank you!! [NAME] this week and [NAME] next week, I‚Äôm getting closer and closer to having them all!! :)
This is full of bullshit
If [NAME] was looking out for him why did he let him get into the accident in the first place? Guess he wasn't paying attention.
I'll have a glass of wine on your behalf.
But what volumes does the 3rd chart speak?
I love [NAME], he‚Äôs literally the craziest couch in the nba lol! He could win couch of the year or be fired next week! 
Good job! Next, I recommend going NO contact.
i assume there will be a ring involved in this movie like his other 2 most recent films?
I told them I‚Äôm not ETFSEC so they cancelled the call :(
FRIENDSHIP WITH [NAME] OVER. [NAME] IS NEW BEST FRIEND.
Looking at this hurts my teeth but dot damn those roses look so pretty
Oh my gosh! That light house!! Its terrifying!!

Hit my head on a bench doing parkour. Looked like that lol
Ireland because Ireland. Not me but i did something pretty scary.
Love [NAME]. Amazing beaches!
You don't know the lawyers I know and the judges I know. Law depends entirely on who you talk to.
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him
Calm down, dickwad
you have zero evidence that anything in this story is fabricated. your blind cop hatred just really, really wants you to believe that.
"""Can I speak to the Suns' manager?"""
Someone died that day.
Was it just me or when they showed the backboard camera did the hoop look like it had a surprised face?
This is an awesome idea. I'm in with my coins when this is ready to roll.
Wise choice. You had kebab.
Yeah that dragon one with the same style ? Mesmerizing. I believe there's also one close to Civic center
Honestly Texas deserves to win with they way they‚Äôre playing, they clearly came motivated and they‚Äôre outperforming UGA on both sides of the ball.
haha packing it in already after a regular season loss
Yes, its completely normal. Everyone I know is better than everyone else.
If I wanted to send a message about how much I hate my life and get literally no response then I could just text my mother.
Well they did make it entertaining on [NAME], almost forgot OW has all these heroes.
Obviously you defend cnn for doxxing the Covington high school kid. Aka child endangerment/abuse.
I hope The pelicans trade him and [NAME] if they trade [NAME]. Hate to see them waste away in NO
Hey thanks! Happy new year to you too!
I actually want to die rn. I don't want to watch the SB but I know I'm going to.
It is a fictional llama...how much PC do we actually need?
Laughed. Out. Loud
So Much Feeling in One Picture , Great Love It :)
Perfect! Thanks
I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more!
Loving this guys game. So much more confident as the team lead
Bore off, you pearl-clutching, centerist coward. 
Stimulating rebuttal!
I love this post so much. Really drives the point home and made me laugh!
That could be the biggest I've seen.
Provided you didn‚Äôt break any of their rules, you should email OKC support.
They are both lame.
> male person should be romanceable > of course this requires the protag to be female Found the [NAME].
If you zoom in a bit you can tell that it‚Äôs literally painted on.
Dogs can go on the internet?
[NAME] I wish we had a free pass to say that üòπ Would make my days so much easier
I'm not fantasising, I'm watching it happen. Just like I watched [NAME] smooth, supple back.
Feb ‚Äò06 [NAME] But your point stands
It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.
Maybe focus on today instead of worrying about eternity? You'll get a lot more out of life that way.
>tries to insult [NAME] for wasting time in a stupid thread >is only other person in thread
Currently in Cali, jobs pay more so it works out, big problem is the fires in the cheaper areas :/
Nice! I haven‚Äôt listened to them or Tool in so long. Will def be getting back into them now.
Yeah, your dopamine receptors are going back to normal.
You are right but stick a cleanse on that bad boy and he's golden
Just about to say this!
I second disagreeing that they are awesome.
Agreed. He always sounded like he was forcing to much air out of his lungs when he talked to try to have a more intimidating voice.
As far as I know, the last necromancer you kill is guaranteed to drop a lantern.
Huh, never heard of that term before. Something new every day!
Omg the hockey god‚Äôs actually helped us !?
Yeah, but you get the honor back for skinning them as 'Resourceful'
So what you‚Äôre saying is that the frogs used to use the chemicals on us? Oh, how the tables have turned.
Excellent, I was wondering about [NAME] the moron recently.
Slowing down does not equal stopping, the answer to stopping this is at a government level, not praying that corporations want to leave possible profits alone.
I don't know what that means, nor do I care. 
Shut up, don‚Äôt block the sanctimony train.
That doesn't mean they're impossible. Minnesota's 7th district is 64% rural, R+12, and represented by [NAME], a [NAME].
not sure why people are downvoting you saying youre a hurricane fan
Weird flex but ok
Some of them are delusional and believe their victims want it
Just tell them cheating is part of toxic masculinity and they will immediately crack down on it.
‚ÄúDo you guys actually disagree with the idea of taking [NAME] constitutional rights without due process‚Äù [NAME] -signed a gun owning lefty liberal
Lol you sweet summer child. I wish I weren't so cynical and had hope like this.
That's freedom of speech for you. We have to give even the assholes a chance to talk, because the alternatives are worse.
Is that seriously the story? I haven‚Äôt googled it. I just thought it was cool as a WW2 buff
Downvote because prophet
he is a very dangerous man
Your husband isn‚Äôt at all worried about your reputation since he‚Äôs the one who spread the lie. Something to think about
Thus confirming that trump supporters dont actually know how the US Gov works.
Shame.
That last sentence pains me
How dare you disrespect [NAME].
How do you know this?
Everyone clapped too btw
Just rephrased it into two sentences for you. It's a great story!
I love crows!!!!
‚ÄúAn eye for an eye‚Äù Proceeds to take 2 things away from killers

Man, I would gladly roast this one. Fat rich people must be tasty..
This is my new favorite video.

They're obviously not.
Her Twitter checks also clearly a fucking idiot.
They were definitely having sex. He will never be trustworthy. 8 years is insane.
Seeing the past doesn't mean being in the past
Wer was u wen sec is kill
Hell yeah, high five. Good job!
I'm very open to doing anything to help me abstain. This seems very helpful I'd love to know more.
That was so damn cute. She looks just like [NAME] and I bet it just melts his heart to see how mature that girl is
Ego is a hell of a drug
So that‚Äôs what it looks like when it‚Äôs not a flop
I live in Orlando, where was this? lol
This comment is complete garbage.
She has a PINK semi?? Wow! Impressive!
I have a 4k screen lol. I didn't know you could do custom css rules. Thanks for the help.
Hey now, don‚Äôt try to have the guy killed. This is an upstanding sub. 
Riot keeping nailing it in the cinematic and music department. That was so fun to watch, especially how amazing [NAME] and [NAME] part was.
What the actual hell?
Damn perfect üëå
I was worried about that too honestly
Exactly. Nothing but a burden at first, but our boy knows how to fight now.
It isn't complicated at all. You are growing up. Congrats.
I can't imagine why anyone would hate this. It's beautiful.
Oh my god, who in the world eats their cracker without its Shell? Simply disgusting, didn't even had to ask. Smh
I'm 35 and never knew this was a thing anyone did until I saw this posted on Facebook awhile ago. It looks massively uncomfortable?
Lazy as hell
Yeah and I love my dog and I'd miss my dad.
There is no your reality. There is only your delusion.
Atonement is just something else. [NAME] is just so lovely in his writing.
WeTV and TLC are different companies owned by the same bigger company. Different teams working on the shows. WeTV came out on top this season.

My favorite joke of all time - whenever someone says 'My head hurts' you say 'it'll get better with practice'.
Enjoy you Salad
Mmh, I love the smell of thought policing in the morning. 
I think in any state it is permissible to record if you let the other party know that you are recording. I could be wrong, though.
Well then you obviously have no fucking clue what equality means.
I wish I could help you but I‚Äôm in the same ditch as you. High school is causing me troubles too
why I wonder?
I would love to see an [NAME] cosplay!
"I love the people who confuse this sub for some kind of ""intellectual"" gathering lmao"
It shouldn‚Äôt say that, because it is not single payer 
Probably, [NAME] will accuse him of raping her now. 
You‚Äôre killing me. Let a brotha know next time lol
His base is too large to knock him off. Unless he gets impeached/indicted/god knows what, he‚Äôll probably be it (sadly). 
Im not in a hurry, its my goal for brawlhalla. But after hearing how many hours people have, its gonna be a long journey
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome

I like this kid
I'm so proud to be british
Oh sorry, I forgot there isn‚Äôt any paperwork involved in getting a gun.
This is a pathetic grasp to hope where there is none, hoping for a top 15 pick isnt going to bring us out of the bottom Look at edmonton
[NAME] is the greatest player to ever pick up a basketball
I am proud to be racist No one in real life will know this
happy cake day.
Comedown is only a tenth of addiction. Addiction is when you find a high that you love more than yourself. Be careful.
A great way to start the new year. Happy New year everyone.
Love it or hate it. That kid is a hero
Yeah what kind of loser writes songs about girls
Yeah lazily typing a naughty word to some retard on the internet is a real indicator of being angry rofl
Sorry, should have searched for the artist's name. Karma Decay is a lot less reliable than I thought it was.
alright yeah guess i am stupid
medical care in the US sucks.
No I don‚Äôt, why can‚Äôt you bring your hand to do it?
Sometimes all you need is to know someone else has been there and believes you can do it too. You got this. Keep it up!
Thank you sir, this has made me happy. 
For a second I didn‚Äôt see the t in ‚Äústack.‚Äù Was wondering how you did that but nvm.

Great program, the wife and i have been able to pay down 10k in debt in 3 months since moving our daughter into the program

That host's sense of superiority and childish sarcasm is so terrible that it physically hurts.
Leafs would have won this game if it wasn‚Äôt for that bullshit overturn.
That‚Äôs true, thank you
Just got back from TWC, and they were great! Thank you. 90% they were fried. Will try these others next 
She really was, saw some old pics of the two of them together in Season 1. The lip fillers and eyebrows can go, IMHO.
I'm just concerned about [NAME] health. Do you think an old, ugly, fat, stupid person like him should be eating such unhealthy meals?
That's... pretty unexpected actually.
Aha! This is my fear, that the gloss over key elements because they want to target a wider audience!
Different doctors have different opinions on who should and shouldn‚Äôt be vaccinated.
[NAME].
I understand that but I enjoy the silence and lonely feeling I have.
I have noticed that one is good for thinking straight and light bulb moments.
You missed so many...
Listen carefully and watch me wink as I speak. The guy I'm really looking for, *wink*, is Mr. [NAME], *wink wink*.
Your nurse is an idiot and I'm sorry you dealt with that. Yes you are sterile, and talking to your doctor is a good idea.
It's pronounced hay-SOOS, thank you very much...
Lots of them to mature. Thank you for half baked?
You‚Äôre the best grandmother a person could hope to have.
Sounds sweet man, nice memory to have!
Like you said your tired probably mentally and physically. You need a dam break is what it sounds like my friend.
"I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance.
I really like the hot pot at Lucky Bamboo. Their dim sum made me sad.
I'm nauseous
And the players who are older than me are retiring and it looks like I might never play professional baseball.
Except... that's exactly what I was taught in [RELIGION] school. One god, theee aspects.
Yeah, I know. I was kinda hoping you didn‚Äôt. Ya know just for the point of what a great salesman this dude was.

"Tell us more about this ""scaring people as a prank hobby"" bit."
Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
Just get pissed next time he asks and tell him to fuck off Some people just think they can take advantage of people who help them
Wow, he showed some backbone. I‚Äôve always been pretty ambivalent towards him, but this ups my opinion a little.
Adoration is definitely something I could do more of. Thank you!
ha Ha HA
Oh you mean [NAME]?
Thank you! I'm going to do my very best. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
He's probably already more than uncomfortable, just having a woman who isn't Mother that close to him.
This happened to me at Walmart. I was literally there for 10 min using the coin machine and now I have a cart shaped dent in my door...
And even then why you think that the only puck should be given to the kid with nicest smile?
> hands down i see what you did there
No. You are not.
Big and smooth as a marble.
i know this isn't a private corporation and only the government so no real reason to be that concerned.
Thank you for posting this. I never heard this particular interview before.
Loved him in Gavin and Stacey! Thanks for the recommendation
I just don't get how so many people on this sub know that about the Dems but still manage to get taken in by the [NAME].
i‚Äôve heard great things from the people who actually saw it. Thriller is my favorite genre so it seems right up my alley
I've been playing for years and it's still a bitch for me to lay off balls.
I love chicken

One of these vids should end with [NAME].

Stranger things have happened, but still, good luck.
[NAME]! Fun fact, it was [NAME]. who led the stacked 86 Mets rotation in wins with 18.
You're all insane.
I‚Äôd want to know what happens after
I'm assuming OP is female and the other person is male.
Isnt that the god awful truth
So [NAME] is still on the block and hoping [NAME] can nominate someone else.
Either way, it's at the very least not an ethical way to conduct business.
I really want [NAME] out of these two, but I‚Äôm curious who he would tap as OC.
>ribs My condolences on your loss.
I'm the exact opposite. The idea of not existing anymore relaxes me and makes me want to end it
nvm it took me a whole 10 seconds to realize LA schools probs don't have built-in snow days
SHUT THAT SOFT ASS SHIT UP
Thank you [NAME]
I'm not sure. There's some good youtube compilations of him.
I dont think [NAME] or [NAME] said a word during this exchange. Like umm, yeah we actually love our wives and want to be with them. 
"But terrible people is my ""type"""
As a teacher with a bunch of sick students, this scares the hell out of me.
Wow talk about strength!
America is cool
And there's good reason for that. The SD is absolute shit
oh man another year
Thank you, I love Heart and Zeppelin and haven't seen that till now.
ok. thanks for the info!
Go and be around friends. Or become an INTP so you don‚Äôt have the lingering feeling to be around friends.
Neko Atsume is a really wholesome and cozy game too!
Care to explain?
I like how the ceremony goes right out the window after he delivers the rings to get all the pets.
Holy heckin heck
Now if he does off himself, everyone will think hes having a laugh screwing with people instead of actually dead
Never again lol
Actually someone already said goodbye so checkmate idiot
My fav frank songs are white Ferrari, super rich kids and bad religion, I know those are popular songs I just wanna get deeper into his music 
This is one of the worst I've seen...
I cant even deal with this you are fighting with someone over your inability to understand a sooooooooooooooooo is sarcasm. Get some help
Exactly, but I guess I've gotten used to people forgetting the club exists haha
You can't release A New Hope 2.0 in China if you do that though.
Care to share your thought process ?
Oh yeah, not planning on it this month. Haha. Just getting psyched for my first summer in the PNW!
I didn‚Äôt know [NAME] was a boxer, he can take a punch though!
You will be fine.
Yup, it's pretty funny to know we technically use the metric system.
I stuck a bit of glass up there. It was a pane in the ass.
Wow. [NAME] is a giant POS. He'll be really happy being single and dying alone.
Maga hat is a symbol of hate and should be treated as such.
I'm glad you have your kids, but have you seen Brooklyn 99 like the op stated? It's worth living for too.
Hey there, I hope you're still with us. Let's talk.
Lol that‚Äôs classic!! Thanks.
Thanks for the compliment
You‚Äôre welcome!
Dam üò£ that was awesome!
my god quit getting blocked
[NAME] could kill someone on purpose and she isnt going to get into trouble EVER
This is terrible advice
Can you expand a bit? That would be interesting for us that are not in the know.
Nah I think that‚Äôs a salarian from mass effect üòÇüòÇ
FIDLAR dropped their new album today (yesterday?). It is certainly...different. But I'm enjoying it all the same
Tell her off yourself (and poke her in the back) that she's way too old and way too heavy to be pulling this stuff.
Because the hierarchy is afraid they‚Äôll get burned.
I was hoping you could. :)
OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is so cringe.
I think it's ridiculous that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.
I‚Äôm so happy for them. I hope he drowns in a puddle of bacon grease.
Who the hell has reddit in anything other than dark mode ??
Love it [NAME]
After 8? I'm afraid after 5. It gets dark here early. :(
FaceTime actually sounds like a brilliant solution. I don't know why I didn't think of that, but I'm glad you did! 
But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.
Right?!
Very good advise, I did not realize this. I guess there is more risk in a lease than what I initially thought. 
The kidd series is by far my favorite. Much more lighthearted than the prey books.
Yeah, for sure. I've definitely come pretty close to panic attacks at the dentist as well.
The bathroom on the first floor at my school had no soap dispenser, a destroyed toilet, and toilet paper so long it left the bathroom.
It's the universe trying to kill us with radiation :D
Does this really work? Any one else try this yet? I'm surprised I've never heard of this before thank you.
Then please post the story here. I don‚Äôt go to links I don‚Äôt know. üòê
Update: still alive, the paranoia is gone 
Royals can be prosecuted. Princess [NAME] was charged under the dangerous dogs act many years back the monarch enjoys sovereign immunity.
Right. Because [NAME] was a circumcized [NAME] who died for our sins.
Not talking about [NAME] as I've barely seen any of that, just the implication that [NAME] got a lot of new mixups
Would love to share this on twitt and FB ...
Thank you XD
Ah I set myself up for that one. Alright you win it does look cool.
He didn't blow anything. She blew it with him. What a fun guy!
I WaS KIddInG i loVE U lOLlOL
They'll just move. There is no amount of enforcement that will change that. The United States isn't the only nice place to live.
I've edited my comment. Still a shitty game.
You can see [NAME] weapon on the plane in the background when [NAME] is talking
Seriously, I‚Äôve never had rendering problems (External SSD) until now... Not even on the PTR
Ah I didn't know that. I meant this [NAME] ad:
except that series takes place like 5 years after rotj, while [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] were all 30 years older when ep7 started filming
That‚Äôs not a good thing to do. And taking it into account for sentencing is fine. But she‚Äôs still guilty.
"""Look, let's just be civil about this. At least no one was hurt. I think"""
I wish you have a best luck on your journey.
Fuck it, it's time we spend not adding to the debt
TeamViolet going strong fam!
So juicy i'm surprised the man from Del Monte isn't knocking at his door.
Love Galore pt.2 üíØüî•üî•
I don't particularly want an Eagles repeat either. Chargers, Colts or Chiefs would make me feel best. Then Rams and Saints.
Thank you! Yeah, I can see that. I'm just posting old work of mine, some of the resolution isn't that great- apologies!
I've have a serious fear of getting winded, this video made my balls fall off 
It burns...
[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], hey [NAME]. [NAME]! I‚Äôm a prostitute robot from the future.
I like how bro is just underlined for no reason
Pudge was great
#Screw you, [NAME].
Why tho... I don't understand why I like this so much
I preferred the old one that only made me want to gouge one eye out
One of my favorite shows of all time.
Im sorry that I'm only able to give a single upvote for this wonderful, graphic, and accurate visualization.
Nokias can even connect to a fax machine? TIL
Hey man, I was just answering the question. 
Ok, I get a feeling that you might be a bit too radical here. I'm not going to keep trying here, have a nice day.
Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)
My 2 year old loves Word Party. Story Bots is another good Netflix option.
Any normal draft game is more serious than a silver or gold game. Atleast thats what I see.
And none of them give a damn about the [NAME]. Very telling.
Poetic and also true.
That's not an explanation of why it would be undemocratic.
no wait come back
Don‚Äôt do this. Unless you‚Äôre a total prick. Communicate like an adult, don‚Äôt play games like a child.
They don‚Äôt like to be excluded from anything
[NAME] SHOT THE PUCK *AND* WE SCORE Who woulda thunk
This response is highly unexpected yet logical. I‚Äôm fixin to chew on it for a spell.
Did we see the same scene? [NAME] takes it like a champ. You *gain* points for turning her down.
The last statement just seemed like a bit of a jibe.
I'm so glad I saw this!!! Now I know how to wash my face! I can't wait for the tooth brushing tutorialü§ó
I think that stuff started before he was an alderman
oh look at you /s
Thank you so much. That means a lot. ‚ù§
Just 58 seconds more boys. Hang in there!!
Hey, that's awesome. I'll be sure to think of some questions for you in the future.
This wasn't exactly aimed at the national brain trust.
I mean I feel like some people lose it more drastically than others.
So many snowballs [NAME] has to tell the fans to stop LMFAO classless losers
Down Goes the Bear
I read fuck and not tuck. Was wondering how the hell it wasn't creepy....
Exactly, thank you. 
You seem fun
I just want to know what the experience of meeting himself was like.
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was saying, thanks for pulling the stats I was too lazy to.
Y so serious
First thing I thought of, people need to know these things
AOC used the exact version that [NAME] had been pushing for years. So it's no surprise that its nuclear-phobic.
Is anyone else bothered when the Thunder announcers mispronounce [NAME]? On that note, [NAME] AND 1!
Oh yeah. Here's hopin to Persona next.
They‚Äôve changed their mind so clearly they would change their position when scrutinised. Like you said though, he was ignored. 
I'm really excited for [NAME]. He seems to be continually improving in this stretch of games. I'm hoping he stays up once [NAME] is healthy.
I‚Äôm a HR professional and deal with this all the time. You‚Äôd be surprised how ignorant most people are about their paychecks.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** melodesign! ^(hug)
The powers that be don't like it when you try to educate the [NAME], but that's to be expected.
Hi, [NAME]! I hope you have the best day ever! -HappyFriendlyBot
[NAME], that's pretty damn good for a state like Virginia, which, although not a swing state anymore, was red not so long ago. 
This jokes a name changer
Absolutely. I have 3 kids with this woman. My guilt is compounded because I will be tearing their worlds apart too.
Im desperately hoping that that is either sarcasm or a troll.
I feel like they could just be renamed by the stream + commentators. If the player refused to play then I think they just wouldn't play.
Eh [NAME] left before and the show was fine. Then ‚Äúshe came crawling back from New York‚Äù lololll
Tree house of horrors they are all great.
It would be nice...but there arent any within 70 miles of me. Not even one in my home state.
Omg i probably need to get mint to drop some truth bombs
Thank you for your time and effort! I'm going to actively focus on enabling my Rein and tracking enemy ults.
I'd smash
This comment has sent me on a several hour journey down the rabbit hole of [NAME]. Thank you
I wish there was videos of people like this figuring it out later organically and just feeling dumb lol
well that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs fake.
I plan on being respectful lol. I hope he‚Äôs there.
This is all soooo nice. What nice people.
Think conductors got it bad, just think about how [NAME] feels.
She's not even that pale that dude's cummies are just translucent. She gotta find a man with mayo cummies
Ok dude!
Thank you, I've been looking for this forever.
Think this was an underrated signing. Dudes such a beast when he‚Äôs on, can go multiple innings.
This was good. I‚Äôm not the OP, but thanks for posting.
Better than mine.
You‚Äôre welcome!
Oh, apologies. Silly me didn‚Äôt think to check the sub first.
Now let's see what games media will magically defend because he's against it.
Thanks, I hope I can get through it too. Good luck with your futile attempts to sleep :p
I'm trying to figure out how I would react if I saw one of my employees on LivePD like this...
Ay, last time i popped my blisters yall got mad
I don't think the people who agree with this post fully understand how large a legion is.
PNW represent! Southern Oregon. Our non-mono scene is....pretty sparse.
I have friends who drove from interior Alaska to Arizona in less than 48 hours... It's possible.
Oh wow this is good to know, it was always my go-to spicy ketchup when I make frozen fries at home.
Please do not take that personally. I thought this was a great photo.
Love that we have the same amount of playoff wins as them this year!
boi that nose job
This. It IS a minority here, but they are very vocal and very active, exactly what you would expect from a PR team
Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol.
Welcome to adulthood my bro.
~ [NAME]
I don‚Äôt think he forgot. His weight just almost carried him off the sink...
Not really. Relying on someone you can't trust is bad. Sometimes relying on someone is the only happiness you'll get.
Keep your head up
Me cheering for the Wild this year
Nah I'm good thanks, I still got Netflix and the Pirate Bay
I‚Äôm genuinely upset that people missed the sarcasm because your comment is hilarious
your post is awesome. People need to hear this more. Thank you.
I think in 1.0 it's a lot harder to SDI out of Fox's dair, but I forget why
I love reading these posts and not realizing it's [NAME]
I just got the zc and season pass for bo3 and have only played solo. Loving the game though.
Not really haha Young Living announced that they'll be releasing a CBD oil later this month
Mirror:
...holy crap.
Maybe she can bartend on the side when Back in NYC. Oh, I forgot her progressive policies put said. Bar out of business. 
I would think terrible, awful things.
You his SO?
We live in a completely different world than the 70s and 80s now
I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
That might have been a pickup attempt. It was a golden opportunity for a line
Surprise! That fat woman you see on the bus every day is actually this generation's [NAME].
Definitely not a misunderstanding if you read the articles Bloomberg posted.
Thanks dude, palms were very sweaty lol
You‚Äôre using the failing of someone else as an excuse to make the same mistake yourself
Maybe she was attempting to be ironic? I dunno, man, people are just an enigma.
Thanks. I though it was fooling a penquin.
Lucky I caught people reacting on twitter. For some reason I thought this game as at 6 PM.
Proud of my Senator today
All the [NAME] who‚Äôve been harassed or assaulted for ‚Äúlooking [NAME]‚Äù will be glad to hear that.
Entire new coaching philosophy is needed. Enough wasted possessions, contested iso mid-range jumpers with 15 seconds left on the shot clock and terrible 3pt defense.
You got more upvotes. Now you are beating me.
Yeah Stupid Sexy groening
Bit odd because plan B was exactly the same as plan A.
It‚Äôs treason then.
"That comment about ""kill him with kindness"" was kinda unnecessary. How about just kindness for kindness sake? lol"
I'm glad you got the help you needed. Sorry we couldn't help you here.
They can't they need a morty dumbness shield
You know they are happy to see him. Yeah, he's not the most impact over all this work in the HOF but to start somewhere...
Personally, I assume that those who claim NOT to be deprived in this way are just adept liars. That's how deprived I am.
Sorry I dropped mine can I have another?
Single payer is not what they have in Canada or the UK.
Damn, wish I could just pick up a hobby and start training 4 or 5 times a week...
Super [NAME] told me [NAME] was crap though and that [NAME] was far better :(
I called an ambulance for my friend without knowing it was against her wishes. She never blamed me but I felt really bad about it.
She was walking like that shoe was up her butt at the club. So tacky and just nah.
That‚Äôs so nice! Kindness like this makes my heart happy.
I couldn't agree more.
Damn this was deep. Hope the best for you and you could really turn this into a short story or something of the such.
That, and truthers. Like, why? It just makes everything else she says seem suspect to the average person regardless of how sound it is.
Maybe you should reflect on why the left is full of [NAME]. I would also like your source on TD being white nationalists.
I don't know why this image bothers me so much
I can't wait to tell my daughter how she used to love me so much she even wanted to watch me poop.
Yes! She lost more!
That‚Äôs not proof.
This is a totally different one right?
i see, thanks bro
You are amazing! Proud of you!!!!
This movie, though simple but effective, shows how it is being jammed in your face is because it was just one police officer, chill.
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Me too, but unlike phones humans can ‚Äûlife‚Äú without the other
My boss had this conversation with me just before Christmas. I start my new job in February.
That's when they brew their second cuppa before work haha
> WE AREN'T EVEN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM I was well ahead of you. It was the prices being in dollars that gave it away.
"""RUDY! RUDY! RUDY! RUDY! RUDY! RUDY! RUDY!"" Come on, gimme more [NAME]."
Well it obviously helps you rationalize your total unwillingness to take action to make the world a better place. I hope that you grow past that.
Seaton Park > Central Park
He won't cost over 100M, hopefully not over 80M either. That's cheap today.
Don't care. Have fun. Got better things to do.
Did you even venture to scroll through the nearly 2h long video linked in this thread? Not hard to find....seems like you are just avoiding it.
Sacrilege! :-P
No sure what‚Äôs going on here, but [NAME] was one of my absolute favorites growing up
Nope, in reality this does never happen indeed. Cant we see what the problem is here?
I gotta take credit for YouTube because he recommends some sick underground artists but old ones? Never, at least for me
I was messy..............then I became a minimalist.
Bless your dog!
Honestly Quadriga has been pretty decent, can't fault them for the bank struggle, that's just how the Canadian banks have been towards this space. 
This is amazing. You look like a video game character whose hair texture hasn't loaded in properly.
Greetings from Singapore! Anyone looking to play, please come find us at our discord: 
They're really cute but I'd never in a million years own one because they literally smell like week-old pissed on rugs.
I get ya. If thinness was something I could buy I'd be flat broke by now
You can only nominate one unit and said unit has to be one that wasn't already nominated
No, those are called natural monopolies. See: particularly the writings of this guy: 
Fucking love that song.
My bad if I just leaked /u/keypuncher and /u/ibiteyou 's Christmas card photo...
Good job. :)
Same can be said for fragile liberals who can't handle cultural traditions and keep trying to push the envelope.
As a vegan, I can't tell you how happy I am to find any restaurant with vegan options! That man should be showering you with gratitude.
Sorry, might have been the wrong command. Just checked my uplay for it. It's /nodinputpad
Can he teach them to run really really fast?
I mean it's just not. A lot of people are just like this.
It dulls the pain
Jajaja (hahaha)
I just got a shirt made that says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have kids my dog is allergic‚Äù
Anzac day rules are even dumber
It's funny cause OP is trying go against the mindset that most men are predators but in inadvertently reinforcing it :/ awkward.
Not really grinding you down though. The EU is just sticking to the agreed schedule
That actually makes a lot of sense. I stand corrected.
Sorry you feel that way
did he just hecking kill [NAME]
Unhappy, I am.
Sorry just seemed like you were trying to make it a [NAME] thing
I'm at job that is effecting my mental health, and I'm not sure if I should be up front.
Coming from [NAME] who is addicted to Facebook. Thanks Facebook!
Totally agree, except I usually (this occasion included) lack the pity haha.
Looks like modern art tbh but its good
Here‚Äôs a little update lol so far I‚Äôve had 3 matches today and all of them were ‚Äúcam models‚Äù lmfao
I was JUST thinking about how much I enjoyed Swalla la laaaa last night too!
On my RX480 it gave me 15+ average FPS, when you're hovering around the 60-70 mark, that 15 can be huge.
[NAME] hand must have burned holding that blasphemous law book.
Wish this applied to TPS's
I mean, I‚Äôm an occasional monarchist myself. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm under some delusion that it‚Äôs a fix all.
Same. Ugh
Here you are again my friend.
That would be cool too!
Wow crazy. Proud of her
Isn't the swastika backwards? I just love how fucking stupid racists are Can't even draw their own shit right
This! The [NAME] need to be kicked out!
I love this. [NAME] bless [NAME].
I just don‚Äôt see why he pushed me leave with him so bad just to dip when I did
Definitely gonna go lookin' for that mod.
This is almost 4 years old!
I had 175/1 back in March. About to go to Vegas again and it will be disappointing to only get 12/1 this time.
I keep giggling cause I‚Äôm imagining them fitting together like a puzzle...
They're both made by [NAME], and they're both hilarious.
He ded?
No, so it's not our kingdom
Thank you. I‚Äôve been feeling a bit better since they make people happier.
>!Did the name of the trophy gave away the twist to you?!<
Henlo little alligatrr. ou almost slipped there. OH FUK NO NO NO NO ALIGATRR PLZ DONT EET MEEEEEEEE
My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
Thanks for the link, my email indeed was breached it says. I‚Äôm just not sure what this exactly means.
You've been promoted to branch-manager!
You mean you love their meat right? You dont love chickens.
Pretty fuking sure exit scam..
The cheerfulness of the ‚Äúhail satan‚Äù text overlay was unexpected.
Happy for him, great game. 
Same, it was such a wholesome way to smite the person!
ooohhh this seems quite clever, i'll try this out. thanks! 
Do you know my ex husband? You sound so much like him according to his old coworkers.
I hope you have a wonderful cake day!
I also love that her correction was wrong. But all the bustling millinery on The Island can do that to a person.
Which makes it even weirder that he hasn't played [NAME] yet. He seems born for that role.
So... no nerd here to say the stomach doesn't really do that? Is this Reddit or what?
Making DC climate an unapologetic brutality with blistering dry winds and no snow on a typical day.
An ugly fuk
He only does it when I'm playing a fast-paced racing game where I need to always see where I'm going.
Noticed the same thing. Wonder if it's also like that on the redesign. My hunch is on 'no'.
Checkout real cool people that I'm sure would love to help you out.
Lol Yes Most people arent 100% either (especially women). For a variety of reasons...finding beauty in other people, curiosity, jealousy, etc...
Mr [NAME], tear down this wall. 
No no forms or anything. I was pleading with them not to go and it seemed surreal that I was being forced to go
Yes because there is an optimal level that does not occur naturally.
That is a man who's soul ded that day.
I understand why he's confused but [NAME] is the host of the show, he can't just leave
If there were ever people who deserved that kind of discomfort it would be someone who tortures native animals.
He couldn't block a shot if it was from my dead grandma
I forgot the Olympics was gonna happen there üòÇ hopefully the signs and stuff will stay!
there are a lot of heroes who have tricky mechanics, tinker especially for me
Like me.
So remember when everyone was reading [NAME] for making a song and performing it on the show around a contrived part of her brand???
You can't help those who won't be helped. Let's leave him be.
It‚Äôs amazing what can happen when they get a good nights sleep
Taking this way farther than needed...
I had a GB in 1999 and it was worse than birthing my son. I would have loved to have had the sleeve....
Welcome back to H town!
Love the cheese!
#YES
This is really cute
Does anyone have the video of [NAME] drawing the charge I didn't get to see it.
[NAME] just ripped his jersey. He‚Äôs frustrated as hell right now
The best soft sequel pre-boot spin-off. The movie that would be better as several movies or a tv series. The best outrage over a movie.
What a grim statistic for Canada.
Because it was funny and people liked it. They otherwise do a pretty job of preventing memery
hey that's my weather give it back -- a north dakota redditor
This is what black market meat sellers will be like when the vegans take over.
You're 17....calm down.
Uh, I have no idea.
Dennis day. I wanna see what the [NAME] would put the Gang through.
Oh, a little misunderstanding, my bad.
Asuelu nailed it.
You're a hero.
Thank you too. I know this sounds like a circle jerk, but let‚Äôs kill them with kindness, lol.
You are sexy af
Go troll elsewhere. This woman needs support, not crass questions.
I just got kerbal space program flashbacks
O R B M A I N
im sure he started that line with his own hard earned money
You are normal. Very normal.
I like how the money blows into her face halfway-through. That's some quality filming.
I dm'ed you
That should be 9 squares all showing [NAME].
Thanks man I hope I can get it before the end of the week
It makes me super fucking nervous edit: was able to buy temple at +1 fuck it lets ride
The real tips are always in the comments :D
No surprise there. It was always his policy to table it upon the deal's failure in Parliament as was set out at the Labour conference.
We're not roasting you. That's not how it works here. Go get help and feel better then come back for proper roasting.
I‚Äôm still gonna wet myself if we get [NAME]
Oh no....
Just what I need; a video of my commute to work so I can enjoy the experience in my free time.
He dresses that way in real life...perfect
> People on the team needs to be cool. yup, totally 2016(my csgo trading days) in a straight line.
You seem fun.
Laugh all you want, it's pretty much indestructible now!
And that's not [NAME] either. It's former HS o-lineman who now runs a frat
ah, i see. yeah it‚Äôs true that the title does seem pretty flippant, though maybe the article itself is better?
Seeing how I was as a teen and how most teens are, nope! Dont want to deal with that.
Ahh got clingy huh.
Suctioning I'm almost certain. Now's the time for you to google.
This game like 30 dollars on Humble Bundle on PC. When it goes down again (sale has expired) I'll try to buy it again.
I will go back to actually read the piece in its entirely but wow. Her gray is so pretty. I‚Äôm jealous
I go everywhere, the XP and money make it worth it. 
Thanks for clearing that up
And try Nuraphones, seriously. It's like hearing your favorite song for the first time.
That's the stuff of nightmares right there
It's refreshing to not see comments with anti-china sentiments here every once in a while.
I wish I didn‚Äôt fall for my ex. He is not a beautiful person. He is a monster.
[NAME] is one of my favorite non dodger players, he‚Äôd make a great addition to the dodgers, hope they push for him 
I worry about throwing draft picks around, but a guy like that is worth it IMO.
No, but its a big problem in itself. 
#KYLO REN IS NOT INTIMIDATING
[NAME] and [NAME] aren't cousins in this timeline, I believe. Just best friends.
People are barbaric even though they are peaceful? You‚Äôre not making any sense.
I am sorry little one
This just made me feel so much better about myself :)
For a sub about motivation y'all are a bitter bunch haha
Reminds me of Ross Lake WA
Yeah, The Donald seems to spread its purging mentality to most right leaning subreddits. Reminds me, I should get banned from r/theDonald again for quoting [NAME]
Just look at the picture
i would love to have your neighbor!! he seems so nice! i really truly do hope you never meet that guy again.
You should see a therapist if it‚Äòs affecting your life or your mental health that much.
Thank you, that means a lot.
Because all our society has done for the past 60 years is talk about your problems.
That boy ain‚Äôt right
[NAME] isn't a race mate
I mean I dont think your wrong at all, but I would still be happy to fight you for funsies.
I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety.
That depends on the area. For a lot places they would need a warrant first.
Battlefront 2 could be a horror game
My point was that it‚Äôs creepy. I never said it was illegal.
Yeah I cannot either on mobile, same with enough internet. Thoroughly disappointing.
I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!
I was impressed by your company in the initial post, but now I see they tried to fire you for their mistake. Glad you had some backing!
Some people might be into that. There are some freaky people out there.
Yea its really dissapointing
I wish there was hope, but we are all bracing for hard brexit. My country is a laughing stock right now. 
You ain‚Äôt far from going postage stamp on that thing!!!!
Go on twitter
My favorite explosion in all of Star Wars.
I can do that too but I have diarrhea
Don't listen to much prog or hardcore, I love some black metal though.
Spider-Verse: The Golden Globes and I are gonna have a helluva time!
Ugh Morons stop breeding
Seriously one of the best soundtracks. I always get chills from the organs, even just thinking about them.
**I can't believe she held out for a full 24 hours before flip-flopping**
Piss drawer. Five bucks says piss drawer.
Let your work speak for itself IMO.
You forgot warden's spamming shoulder bash
Nah, substance abuse is sad, period. 
Girl, wear what you want. Here in Michigan, we get accustomed to cold. No, I'm not freezing just because you are.
I read a news piece 10-15 years ago about how much garbage China dumps at sea. The numbers were staggering back then.
I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick.
Some people just need a hug
It smelled even worse than it sounds. You learn just how quickly someone's feet can rot and really stink up an entire bay.
Thanks for the feedback! I will certainly keep that length range in mind.
What a block by [NAME]
I came across a really really really rare audio track of slipknot, limp bizkit , korn and Metallica....I didn't even know they collaborated
"This is the mildest of mild burns Title should be ""guy didn't know other guy was British"""
The sun has set on the English empire
Fuck me daddy
No thanks, prefer the fairness of Public/Veteran. No cheating admins.
Maybe a parsing or comprehension issue, but are you sitting in the water after you pee in it?
His performance this weekend reminded me of when [NAME] came into the LCS, he would solo kill every single lane
Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.
I would just like to say that this is an excellent comment. Well-written, and very insightful. Thank you comrade.
Oh sorry I didn‚Äôt realize that journalists weren‚Äôt actually autonomous humans that can think for themselves.
You don't picture [NAME]?
ah Yuk!
their is a differences between losing and being embarrassed
That man has such epic face
I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
I apologised an very long time ago as I was wrong at this point you are beating a dead horse
Yeah what do they expect? maybe they should realize if you push Gen [NAME] and under into poverty they won't be able to afford your crap.
Oh, you're completely right. I'm an idiot. I'll be here eating my words.
As a queer man, let me point out the heteronormativity of this statement. I very much sexualized various male characters at various points.
Random question but has your username ever actually worked lmao
He‚Äôs a professional liar making promises to get elected when all he concerned with is a power gain.
You must be fun at parties.
"""Lol, hold my craft beer."""
[NAME] did say he still has a part to play, so hopefully we'll get to see more of him soon.
No thanks, I would prefer to not get infested with malware. 
That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
we need his euro step comp with this in the background [NAME]
Haha, small world, I live/work in the Twin Cities already! üòÇ
That‚Äôs pretty cool. Bet your dad is *vewy pwoud* he still has his accent!üòÇ
Nope, don‚Äôt even know what dart is. Sorry. And thanks!
Sorry I now see how that was unclear, I mean being a unicorn on the internet by admitting you may have been wrong 
Wait till I show up in threads and start saying opposites just to trick you.
Yeah that was his mistake
I mean...that‚Äôs quite obvious. I‚Äôm just left wondering what the other item is. 2/10
Wow, time to talk to the [NAME] about a FPTP alternative.
Sweet, congrats!
It's free hand but thanks for the input üëç
I literally have more friends on HOTS than WOW. Wow is deader than hots.
awkward edit - aww are you a rangers fan, damnit
Oh geez man... You posted this image to at least 600 subreddits.. Why And now made a new account for it...
People‚Äôs shame and cultural oppressions regarding sexual behavior is responsible for all the world‚Äôs woes.
They‚Äôre just insecure tbh
Flirting isn't attractive per se, but (if done right) it shows social acuity and comfort with one's own sexuality, which are 2 attractive traits
If I'm dipping my crust, it's in marinara sauce EDIT: I love hot sauce on pizza
Hmmm.. this is kind of interesting that our name was even thrown into this mix.
Anytime, don't be afraid to reach out if you're feeling down. 
I'm getting worried
Sounds like they get a pass on their morning coffee. ü§¶ Hypocrisy. Everywhere
Well two other close testers are really upset about rolling
Thanks, bud!
Not wrong.
I had this back in 2012 so no not at all LOL
/u/DongPhuongDriver, your time to shine!
Ow is correct.
It's riskier to take on bad contracts right now
Because killing the same mice twice is very tricky
This is very deceptive. If you haven't read it, this article is great! The Deceptive Income of Physicians
Seeing something like this without the usual ‚ÄúWii music‚Äù is so... odd
I'd rather not be in the 90's kid category anyways.
> If you actually believe they are still a threat oh, if only it *were* up to me...
Great post thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's a better love story than Twilight!
Right now but there's a huge push for anyone to be able to self identify and to remove the 2 years completely

No matter what lies you choose to tell, you'll always be just as broken, and it'll always be just as obvious. 
It's okay. One day you won't be so sad and angry, and people will still accept you.
Pensacola Florida 2018 not enough words to describe it. Simply amazing.
God damn, [NAME] gets 2 Mikans? Lucky.
Omg like I get so moody when I'm hungry lol im so bipolar Yyyeeaaahhhh...
Wish we got power plays regularly.
My sentiments.
Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? 
Absolutely gorgeous pass by [NAME]
About fucking time ordering ASAP
You da best thanks
[NAME] has a player option next year that seems likely he will likely decline to secure a new contract with more guaranteed money.
Bike snob here. $400 is hella cheap for any bike that gets raced.
If you can get out to Banff, I highly recommend Nourish Bistro. Incredible vegetarian/vegan food... even meat eaters like myself love it!
‚Äúshe‚Äôs turned the weeans against us!‚Äù
Nah, reviewable offsides is pretty bad
+1 Thought I had depression, turns out I just wasn‚Äôt being happy enough! Who‚Äôda thunk it.
No wonder why their logo always looks pissed
Them or me? I like to catch up on it in the afternoon and drinking helped with the last few.
I'm so sorry
You were shot by a Vigilante!
That's true. But in the real human world, partners have a similar, if not the same, generational separation from their closest common ancestor. 
Big boobs have never made me more or less attracted to a woman.
Know whats too far? Anchovies
I‚Äôm gonna need to see that in writing before I celebrate.
Please tell me how it sounds racist.
Playing the golden oldies eh?
true that.
This is one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen on Reddit
[NAME], one of [NAME] surrogates, went on about how [NAME] completely squashing him in South Carolina is irrelevant because it's basically Guam.
Not really. Also it‚Äôs Winnipeg, sorry we don‚Äôt have the population of Tokyo...
[NAME] is a warmonger. Other than that, he‚Äôs pretty libertarian.
I'm a sexworker and trust me, plenty of us love our jobs an our work.
These subtitles are stupid & unnecessary.
Dumpster fire. I cant quit you Edmonton!!
This is my hat now... this is totally my hat...
Any proof for your statement regarding [NAME] being a PKK cadre?
Holy crap, what happened to that guy?
I thought this was Cookie Dookie for a second
Did this a lot when I was a kid but never did it as bad as this
So what you've never been in a relationship your whole life? At least you didn't get abused! Yah,ok.
I will kill you all
I'm curious to see what his answer will be
And riding one makes you look like a man trying to be tough during his mid life crisis.
"""I lost control"" would have been an understandable explanation. ""It lost control"" is not. "
For me, it's tedious and frustrating enough to do it the first time, but I'm glad you enjoy it
damn it, you beat me to it.
She needs a raise.
Feel the energy! Amazing PK and two great goals!
This was extremely helpful, many thanks!
How I met your mother with muscles
Haha i have a depression playlist 3 years in the making. Love gorrilaz and rip x.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Oh my god.
Damn that is impressive. Can we draft an entire o-line from them?
The guy who tied a shotgun to a balloon so the gun would float away and it would just look like a homicide comes to mind
Thanks. And wow! Nice burn.
Can we ban posts about him now he's a predator? It just makes me sad now, Idk about anyone else
I wouldn't dance if nobody is watching! :)
‚ÄúEat the vegetable growing out of your garbage can‚Äù
The best part about this is that everyone was trolled from Fox to the Mary Shitbag
"BFV have anticheat... Why do you claim ""complete lack of an anti-cheat"" ? They are running fairfight + some inhouse shit afaik..."
It‚Äôs trying to steal his soul by sucking his breath out of him .
I don't, I think this is great. The more they disbelieve media, the more it hurts them.
I didn't say it would be impossible to assemble a computer. I said you wouldn't have one because they'd be too scarce and bloody expensive.
Remindme! 467 Days
A small spark of lucidity left I guess.
I'll keep my eyes out, brah!
Now go to a return? Oh ok, thanks for the store to find something better.

Not surprising since about 85% of all dating relationships end in a break up.
Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.
I like my coffee like my women.
I'm sad, but I just want a new Metroid game, and if this is what it takes to make it great then I understand
LMAO! I would heed his advice if I didn't get chased off by the private land owner üòÅ
He really likes Babylon 5

Fuck yeah! Bring on 2019
Best news ever. Some quality futbol at last!
A girl came into him recently and he pre maturely ejaculated. He had to type this.
You sweet summer child...
This is the most high school post I‚Äôve ever seen on this subreddit.
I just wanna see the fallout of [NAME] leaving. OH And the [NAME] stuff from yesterday. Pls CBS Plsss!!
Our o-line was great outside of 2 games this year. My [NAME] did you even watch or pay attention to this team this year?
I‚Äôm not gonna be writing you a paper check!
I responded to someone else in this thread as well, more in length. Maybe you find that comment more interesting.
Damn we needed that layup
Kept you waiting, huh? 
Yeah, it basically gives us carte blanche to challenge every single gun law, lol. [NAME].
Did you know it inspired a direct to dvd adaptation with the same name?
My daughter just took hers (and failed but not surprisingly). It cost her $125.00.
I don't know what else to do. I have no transportation, personal phone, or money. And I live in a rural area.

"Was he captioning something related to ""Xcept me Im smurt hurr hurr"" with this meme sent? No one's being exceptional in this meme tho."
Omg I did the same exact thing LOL
Thanks for the recommendation! By this point I should just start a list. :D
[NAME] with 8 mins, [NAME] with 30. Disagree.
I thought my [RELIGION] boarding school was weird but now it seems pretty tame and mild in comparison.
That‚Äôs when we realized straights dress like randomized sims
Ur a silly goose
Sorry man, losing the championship after picking him up this year is a tough break
Wait that's a thing? Because that didn't happen when I was young, I don't think
Go to your room!
[NAME] is a big boy. and he still has time to grow.
I play teemo support and nobody can stop me.
Don't call me bitch you fucking sexist. I bet you are one of those white devils. How many women and minorities have you suppressed today?
All of this is almost blow for blow identical to the conditioning children in abusive homes go through. Take from that what you will.
Yeah, I'd rather have Butch than NBC
You describe yourself as your knowledge of Asian languages stopping at knowing they exist? How did you know it was Mandarin then? That's impressive.
Yeah, it‚Äôs just a pointless invasive comment when it‚Äôs coming from a stranger. 
I couldn't reply to the message I got the other day
And [NAME] just got laughed off the stage. How things would be different if he had won. Seriously timelines would be so different.
That has some amusingly unfortunate implications for those that believe all [NAME] are descendant from [NAME], son of [NAME] and [NAME]. 
What do you do for work?
Idk, he could claim the victim jumped in front of his truck. There's no one to deny his side of the story.
Not claming [NAME] would make [NAME] look more stupid lol. If someone claimed [NAME] we'd be over the moon about getting that contract off our team for next year.
Except pets are family & love and maternal instincts aren't finite.
Ugh. [NAME] is so naughty.
A ‚Äú10‚Äù on the landing.
I know it‚Äôs perfectly cooked but something just grossed me out about it. Oh well
Wow that has to be the best advice I‚Äôve ever gotten. Thank you
Keep pressuring the landlord. Threaten to sue them if they don't take care of the problem.
Doesn't change the fact that the Lions weren't in a position to get him because they had too much money tied up in their QB.
Eh. I think either works. But sure. Replies is probably more accurate
**Who would win:** a team of 10+ moderators with libertarian principals or one person with a Python programming environment?
Stomping the Titans before Christmas in 2012. I got to watch nearly every playmaker do something big, and got to razz my Titans fan buddy all day. 
At least they didn‚Äôt destroy the shoes
thank [NAME] that period is over, pretty sure the lightning had like -89 shots that period
This is a great detailed response. Thanks.
I don't know how that works, but it's definitive that it will happen on that date.
I agree with you, but you know, sharia *is* sharia, which I find a tad more frightening 
> the adventure starts in the year 776 Fuck, wait, really?
Still a statistical minority by a great deal.
NOLA is a terrible place to live, ran by democrats forever and this is the result. 
It really depends on what you're going for. Girls are attracted to different attractive archetypes.
Shouldnt you be attacking immigrants on the trains about now [NAME]?
"Yes because people constantly use that as an example of ""TSAs failure"" or a TSA miss when in reality TSA wasn't even involved"
Yeah, maybe if they add [NAME] and [NAME]...
Apparently America is 400 years old according to him as well.
Not really sweaty palms, but holy hell that's uncomfortable as all hell...
This is so infuriating.
oh man clicking 2 buttons before you read an article, the absolute horror
Keep defending their failures and advocating for people to stay silent and just lie down. Good luck with that, it's unfortunately working.
I feel like environmentalism has lost steam over the past ten to twenty years as the call to action has gotten too large in scope and abstract.
I don't need any [NAME]. But if At the Gates actually I made a game, I'd be interested.
the world is becoming very boring...
are you speaking from experience?
Great video, and kudos for waiting them out and not letting your primal instincts let you attack from a wrong position!
I think you're doing a great job modding <3 Can I have flair now?
They aren‚Äôt going to have him skip AAA, but he could legitimately be an option later in the season. 
You hang your head in shame. Not because of this, but just in general.
Islanders [NAME] says that given what happened yesterday we win this game 7-2 after a lackluster first period with a [NAME] hat trick.
Maybe he was just really tanned and needs a vacation
You should probably just use the same soap that you use to wash your body. You can boil silicone sex toys to kill bacteria.
Suck really hard and hope it ends soon? And don't swallow!!! Bleck - sex is so much better with a woman.
[NAME] does not deserve to be with [NAME] just to be cleared. She forced herself and kissed him to prevent him from going to Zero Two.
I've found multiple people who fulfill a specific need of mine, and I love them all!
Yes, he needs to sit the fuck down, that's all I have to say.
Ugh sucker punch
wow i watch the video fews time and I'm still amazed
I really want to see the paw prints.
Nice try GRU.
Damn, I‚Äôd love to own a stg-44...
That moment is always noted in YouTube video comments!
"She also spoke out quite angrily about ""Obamacare"" until she needed it due to her high risk pregnancy. She's remarkably hypocritical."
Such a cute baby, and yet his life begins with stupid parents doing stupid stuffs...
So you can make funny sex jokes on iFunny, obviously.
Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.
while it's debatable how big government should be, I'm glad someone isn't advocating for private fire departments again. that was such a disaster
Bloody Sundae ([NAME] x [NAME]).
Im color blind, i usually see blue as purple and red as green soo...
I know, you see somehow the world is changing me and its so wonderful
Cheers dude. Upvoted!
"Eh. People really are judgemental towards ""hoes"", so I don't blame them. What is stupid is to shame people for having sex."
yeah [NAME] can eat glass, that guy fuckin sucks
Idk if you ask most store managers they will say they started as a cart pusher Probably bullshit but still.....
The problem with crypto is typically when people have a bad feeling about something it rarely turns out well
This just proves you put the bone there, I'd actually be impressed if you showed him putting the bone there
Makes it a lot less stressful tho. Regretting staying up this late tho
That's not really true, people judge all the time, it's just that they're usually too busy judging themselves to judge you too. 
Oh no, I'm getting flashbacks
I agree with the last paragraph, it isn't there fault the other side didn't want to participate though. 
Great documentary on that: Grandmas Boy.
thats adorable aw
He claimed surv cuz he didn't want to be shot by the vig
Orange you just soo cute.
Ugh I have to hope the god damn Leafs win tonight, what a world it is we're living in. 
Even on steroids of all kinds in high doses there is no way that this is done in 16 weeks
[NAME] deserves to play for a proper club ffs.
Ah to be a young teen again
Your wife just proved to your son that her love for him is not unconditional. She sounds ignorant, hateful, and should get therapy or get out.
That‚Äôs crazy! Really bizarre. Is she off reddit too? I did notice fewer posts.
Bless them!
I think it‚Äôs impressive. It‚Äôs actually fairly difficult to be that slick for that long.
I HEAVILY VIBE WITH THIS
So many I can‚Äôt stop ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
What was their GDP then? You forgot that part.
What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
I love Invader Zim.
Love the username
She had really bad chronic back pain from what I can remember, so was self treating with alcohol
I‚Äôm happy. Does that mean I can downvote?
She was acting from her emotions instead of logic. I suppose I have a huge distain for that.
Cheers!!
If this is serious mate it‚Äôs not the kind of shit you should be posting on reddit
It was so frustrating seeing him overthrow people every week. I hope he makes that a point of focus this off-season.
I'm not to proud of them right now. I'm mad at them ‚òπ‚òπ But big ups!!
In my few years playing I never knew this ... I feel so lost now
I love how a few words can turn a post from believable bragging to complete bullshit.
You‚Äôre very right, I‚Äôm relieved I was free of this man before anything else happened. Thank [NAME]! And thanks for your kind words 
Unemployed now re: those crummy health issues. So that probably helped.
And [NAME] hit a girl But he's a nice guy so
Thank you so much, I‚Äôll be following this and try to consult my parents Incase I am unsure of what else he may say.
You, telling me that changing the clock increment no.s took 1 month? 
Prey actually had portals before Portal. Such an underrated game.
Lol I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll change anything.
I do play League of legends and [NAME] is my favorite character that's why my name has Thresh in it :)
Great defensive hustle! Good job by [NAME] and [NAME]!
I love it! Mazel Tov you crazy kids!
how so, he obviously does not want them there/ bad feelings and they probably do not feel welcome there anymore so.
This show and its always sunny for me
Only if I can get one with [NAME] on the back.
This is a great troll. I feel bad for anyone who thinks this is serious.
This is the stupidest thing to get excited over (but I am)
Played in a dangerous cross which [NAME] should have scored from. Just before [NAME] goal
Ive faced the same immortal teams 3 times out of 4 so far. So not by much at least
I'm great. I am having pho for lunch.
HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON?!
It looks like it may be some type of munchkin cat since it has short legs
PowerPoint would be nice
#HUH!? WHAT? WHY? HOW? I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS!
[NAME], you are hilarious! Congratulations 
Happy Anniversary!
It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre in the middle of a pissing contest.
Thank you! Yeah, she won't take bs.
Gonna be a much better game than the last one. So glad you guys are coming to carver
I‚Äôm hoping I can find a stream of [NAME] doing the play by play!
Sorry to hear that, I have it for ps4 and hardcore dlc servers are still up
Excellent, this is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you !!!
I'm going Saints and Chiefs. Although I think the Chiefs-Pats game could go either way
Upvote for buttfuckme.
Can't wait to the part where she ties him to her chariot and drags him around the Capitol.
We really need to go on some sort of winning streak
I don't think we could afford the expense bill for coming out of a pretty cushy retirement.
I've read the series through 4 times. There is literally zero reason to believe that.
Religion is different. It's not just facts and information.
> $100m to throw away For the 2nd time no less.
Someone said earlier today in the other thread he had no doubt they would hear the backlash and relent and that‚Äôs exactly what they did.
Everybody loves labs
If they were good at it, I'd love it.
The must be on the prowl because I've been getting these calls a lot lately.
WHY IS PULJUJARVI ON THE 4TH LINE?!?!?!?!?!
Well. That's your belief. I know you and the next cant tell me how to raise mine so I'm not worried about all that.
Exercising. Yoga. Meditation. Walks out by myself. ( walking meditation) Good friends. Time with good friends.
I love that show, that theme song is my ringtone, I never thought I'd see that anywhere else haha
So its not mum and dad then.
>[NAME] Well he forgot to save me from the 'word of hella'.
Please remove the initials at the subscribers to /r/feet, but I have sand in the hopes that someone called him out.
I've done my part.
[NAME] looks hot in her 70‚Äôs outfit.
So much for the offensive burst in the first half. Lol.
I‚Äôm talking to your momma about it.
Keep it simple. Do what makes the money so you can go do what you want.
You‚Äôre welcome üòä
Awe that one was just for me but I really like the post
I‚Äôve made the same exact comment before It‚Äôs mind boggling
I'd be happy for them to take a shot at him, I think he's an excellent player and only getting better.
They said [NAME] struggled but he made the all rookie team, this guy clearly didn't go very in depth.
Having fuck tons of fun right now
I forget my friends and families names on the regular....
Saw it at work this morning, christ the clouds were beautiful
How are they assholes?
Wow. Got a link?
Performing good with a weapon that is better than almost every other in the game makes you view them better than average? ok
C‚Äômon man, read the comment, if you love [NAME] so much why don‚Äôt you shaft him
Actually I think they were saying on ETR that you have to use it or you lose it for expansion teams
Its soooo cringy that I had to watch it again
I agree. Your last sentence is definitely a better way to word it
But half of the money they made belongs to her.
I remember that one. I to found a special fondness for vacuums after that.
I don‚Äôt CARE!
Looks like he drops the chainsaw right as the branch hits him
[NAME] has said he's giving it over to [NAME] for about 5 minutes now
thanks for your help, it looks like i'm just gonna have to use the ole noggin for this project
idk if you're saying that I'm shitposting or that whataboutism is shitposting. But obviously i'm not nor is calling out whataboutism shitposting.
Im so sad how that movie turned out. We could have achived something good
The 2nd worst president. First time i voted. Been trying to live it down ever since
It's special if you're into it. Some women genuinely enjoy it.
Thanks for clearing that up for me, now I know that I do not need to rush a play-through of the game. :)
He sounds like a stand up guy. I want his attitude in the clubhouse for sure
Happy New Year to all my fellow Asuka mains and all you dirty bastards who show no hespect. Cheers!
That's a very smart move. Anyway, congrats gamer girl, this is epic!
Bagel Bites?! Blashphemous! Pizza rolls or die. (All joking aside, welcome! And Bagel Bites are freaking delicious)
You are an old one!
you should be super proud of yourself. super, super proud. you are absolutely strong, brave and above all AWESOME!! 
okay I just checked and OMG IT's SO TRUE (mostly) I really am a [NAME] <3
That's a cute little theory
Is this game any good? I like the idea of a card game based on neckbeard culture.
My favorite is when he puts his name at the end of the sentence like this. It makes his comment seem so Eloquent! Best, [NAME]
I played in the WSHL last year and this really isn‚Äôt a surprise. It‚Äôs crazy how unbalanced the competition is in that league
Try Yakuza 0.
Lmao good man
You‚Äôre hardly qualified to talk.
You can find the light! Maybe get a pet to love :)
Yeah it‚Äôs a repost, I saw this same exact post in a different subreddit couple months ago
Thank you for that :) I'm not OP but I am really happy to read your comment.
[NAME] is garbage in every single game he plays. He needs to be traded
I‚Äôm a little scared of telling my parents (I‚Äôm in high school.) How do I approach them about this?
Same philosophy makes women stay with men who beat them daily
I've done that in the past. It means he's stupid drunk and is missing you at the moment.
You dont put it in the wastebasket. You put it on your Dad's nightstand.
Too much time am running for it
Hurts to read :(
someone please upload that [NAME] poster at the end
Where on earth do you live that newborn non drug exposed babies up for adoption end up in the foster system? Sounds pretty optimistic on her part.
That‚Äôs not what I mean Him being a snack is just well
[NAME] was born that way, huh
Happy birthday to your friend!
But. They just played Africa. Not even a new song. They have an album to promote!
*Keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times.*
Count it yourself, you're more off than the original post. [NAME] shot her 9 times.
I was wondering what that was and now, I need to go get some brain bleach.
It would actually make me more comfortable if someone did that to me
You talk the talk without walking the walk. You cannot be a [NAME] and worship [NAME].
lol [NAME] trying to attack someone with their back turned
You're a normie in loner's clothing. If you think that most of us haven't tried all of the above already, you're sorely mistaken.
My mom used to think [NAME] was the handsomest NFL coach for what that‚Äôs worth.
Disagree wholeheartedly. I'm actually amazed anyone can think this way.
So edgy.
*oh god oh fuck*
This kid is blatantly trolling and everyone is taking him seriously LMAO. You people should quit Salem your scum reading skills are horrible
Aye...same
Seriously!? Wouldn't a guy do the same thing if a girl didn't even attempt to get him off?
There can be, but I meant the consequences of murdering someone in broad daylight.
The more I look the worse it gets
I always thought [NAME] purposefully was tanking her lip syncs on All Stars because she didn't want to send people home.
He already has a baby with his girlfriend who‚Äôs gorgeous
If you stick a pinky in your butt it activates the hippo camping with us part of your brain.
I can't wait till they invent that pill either, and for you to start taking it, for the sake of the rest of us. Fuck.
Uh oh spaghettio
Just saying no one gets fired for missing the playoffs for one season
State or freedom, either way PR would be better off than the shitshow that was [NAME]
A run??????!!!!
That's a rather annoying extrapolation of what I said.
It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. 
Is that how friendship works? Holy crap, I've been missing out!
This is terrifying. Good luck to you and your family. Hopefully they figure out who the creepers are very soon.
I noticed this while watching it and cracked up... it was so cringey! It was after they watched their wedding montages.
Don't worry, nobody expects much from you people anyways.
I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't had a chance to be called up
Well thanks. Digital currency is one thing I personally havent gotten into yet.
Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?
[ALL]: Guys werewolves aren't real. [TEAM]: They are real.
Which sucks, because it's a *bitch* to find replacements for those.
9 to 4. That's pretty sorry.
Oh interesting. I must have got in a while ago.
Deadass? Shoook?? Come on [NAME], do you really talk like that? You sound dumb. 
Get a card that says ‚ÄúSorry about your loss‚Äù on the front, then on the inside write ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. I quit‚Äù.
I use to work in an office near a 24hr McDonald's. The smell of the place when walking by at 7am was stomach churning.
I don‚Äôt see going to church in there
There should be a single age for all things to be legal as an adult not a bunch of random numbers.
Funny how reddit works
Thank you!! This is so helpful
Seriously? I couldn't even remember the dude's name until about halfway through the season honestly.
The only winner here is this guys future divorce lawyer.
The problem with writing vague laws in 2012 and then implementing then in 2017 is that things are huge changes that have taken place in that time.
I just watched this video on youtube and thought about sharing it here
[NAME] is watching this post in july 12th 2021?
> So having sex is a medical condition? no but std's are
...i love [NAME] for what she did/does for her [NAME]. ...also, would like to see some of the work that comes out of the collective
The ending was awesome
This is from just down the road from where I lived at uni in Liverpool, I'm not surprised by their reaction at all.
Very frustrating. And totally the fault of your school‚Äôs systems for handling the issue. Sorry you have to deal with it.
Well maybe you should think about how other people feel instead of just thinking all about yourself.
exactly. so the kids who are going to the game probably already go to tons of games anyways...which are in the evenings...
I tried my best, but my best was never enough. Thank you.
I'm not a fan of the model and the animations in general. He looks incredibly slapdash.
Right. I am more focused on the length of the relationship vs their age.
Accurate ! Thanks
Mostly because of the hype. I love going out with my friends!
There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.
She did mention she loves making costumes
Thank you for sharing your perspective, and talent.
Can holiday just stop fucking shooting? I can‚Äôt wait till he gets traded.
That map looks interesting. I have always wanted an oil platform in game.
ok? dont really know what that has to do with it. [NAME] designs the offense, [NAME] just runs it
Na I see [NAME] doing a [NAME] in his fight vs [NAME]. Goes all out rage mode and big [NAME] cleanly knocks him oot.
‚ÄúThose floors with *that* paneling? Ugh! Disgusting!‚Äù
found it already but thank you
I feel for you (at a title 1 middle school in lausd) I had a tough day today and reading this made me feel a little better ‚úäüèº
Still extremely impressive.
Where did you get those tunnels? I love them and would like some myself!
I hate watching [NAME] play I can tell before he steps over half when he‚Äôs gunna shoot or pass. His BB IQ is atrocious
"""Now get out of here! But before you go..."""
I think you mean what a factual statement.
Awesome! I just recently custom made some art for my razer panthera! It certainly is a lot of fun to do! üëç
I think you might be underestimating some people sadly.
Id give my left nut for another [NAME]. ...and im a berkeley liberal. THATS how crazy the party has gotten.
Cause boomers know young people like it and want to generate revenue
Is the fruit named after the colour, though, or is the colour named after the fruit?
Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
Oh mate! Happy days. haha. Yeah I totally thought you were starting a course of Radiotherapy haha. All good
Like really when did it become about good or bad sex I thought we were taking about one sided
It was an honor just to be nominated. Being a runner-up is a dream come true ( I keep my dreams realistic and attainable).
And big boobs! Like, what?
No. Just no.
Had one of those in Penticton when I was a kid too.
From the South and can confirm that [NAME] is an idiot and should be saying brink.
Unread. Unworthy of my or anyone else‚Äôs attention. You‚Äôll have to hate alone today, [NAME].
Just saying that there's no reason to go easy on the rich breeders.
Man, I kinda feel bad for dude, hopefully everything went smoothly past that
A concept that doesn't map to reality other than as a metaphor.
That was intentional as fuck. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
What a game.
It‚Äôs not unlikely that his family was already imprisoned or dead, which gave him the window to run. 
Foundation by [NAME] is a great short read.
here for me scenes of [NAME] being dragged by her children
Wow so brave!
Way too much fuuuck
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss op
Too many scammers and time wasters anyways!
I think you both lose because they're at .500. I hope you both enjoy your Leafs pint glasses! Edit: thanks for Reddit Silver mysterious stranger!
Yea we‚Äôre actually pretty efficient on offense considering our personnel. Way better than I expected. The defense is just historically bad
Yes. She should. Just not President. I've heard people say she should, and she is nowhere near ready for that. 
This actually made me squeal like a little girl! Thats awesome!!!! Im so happy!
I wasn't ready for the wholesomeness when I saw it.
you got me for a sec. I was like wow.. that's kind of a weird thing to find h-ohhhh damnit! got me. XD
I dislike [NAME] more and more. Big ego and small feet.
But... but [NAME] literally wanted to murder almost all the Polish people.
I've come here to chew bubblegum and to kick ass.
But people already know I'm weird.
No. Let them earn it. And THEY ARE and WILL CONTINUE
So many questions...
There it is! Just the facts! I take it you are a PragerU man.
You know that mista mista lady? I think I just killed her. - [NAME]
Adjust grip, change how you aim, and don‚Äôt worry about it.
She's not an hero we deserve, she's an hero we have. 
This is irrelevant to what we were talking about.
I un-ironically love that song
Noooo not the booze
I'm okay with killing babies in general. I mean, mastification is the cornerstone of my diet.
I'm so depressed
Try Rescue Melatonin Strawberry gummies and Natural Calm in hot water. They saved my life.
This is actually a beautiful picture lol
Trust your gut
Right. The mantra at my school is that we don't give grades, kids earn them.
A classic. I have these.
Very hot take there, It'd be a shame if somebody... disrupted it. 
Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
You‚Äôre doing a fantastic job at keeping things together. Have faith that you‚Äôre on the right track, and things WILL work them-self out.
Then do it [NAME]. It's basketball. You can do whatever you want out there.
I set the house on fire and almost killed my entire family
AMN is absolutely good enough and [NAME] is also very highly rated
She looks pretty big to me. I doubt she‚Äôs within a healthy weight range.
They love to prey on women that have just given birth. It‚Äôs so disgusting!
It's not free, though. It's ridiculously expensive.
Yea he messed around with a 33 year old man dating a 14 year old children. Alabama is one of the main stream media lies.
I have not read at all about the invisible hand. I know it only as a vague explanation of complex micro factors.
No that would be yet another mistake.
Lmao, this guy is a tool.
If only you had the same sentiment towards those who took over BTC and changed it off this course.
A whole lot of reasons tbh
Honestly im a pretty clumsy belligerent and i lasted 9 months and no case is great life i regret nothing
Saw this a couple days ago and had to stop it and rewind!
That would be more accurate but less impactful/explanatory of the point the creator is trying to make---it's an illustration of the Apex fallacy.
You should play PoE its a better game in every single aspect, you'll love it.
Looking good!!!!!how are you? woww you are a treat...üòâ. Cute body :).
Nvm, I see that the drama sub sees what's up
"Yeah that's about what I found. Not that specific page but I got into ""My Profile"" "
What do you think is reasonably sized?
Am I the only one who thinks these Instagram poses girls do are so freaking cheesy
While I agree with my political views could be of the top of my least favorites and [NAME] weren't ruined by the pic.
I feel the same
I‚Äôm excited to see [NAME] come in here. I hope he plays some more quality, aggressive minutes
Also, allow athletes to come and train during the year, but grant a blackout period before the Olympics or something,
At least I dont care about any of them.
Was expecting a horrifically broken ankle. You have posted the actually unexpected
"The admins do not recognize the ""np"" link. They've said so."
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 1937 - 2016 = Polls not very accurate 2016 - 2019 = Oh yeah, polls have evolved, they're like super accurate now 
I lost it at ‚Äúwait, what did I do?‚Äù
Be careful with this. This is the same rationale lots of people used to hate on the Covington students.
No longer in LA but I really hope he can get reelected!
I want it. It's so cute
5 months until parole
Absolutely horrible.
I enjoyed it somewhat, but haven't felt like rewatching (or owning) it.
[NAME] is in Valkyrie, we're SAAAFFffffeeeee........
? I'm a dude so I was asking how often she feels like guys listen to her. Not sure what you're asking
Good luck!
Dammit. I was expecting to see a motorcycle blow up. That woulda been awesome. Haha
Man we are sloppy
Oh I didn't know. Please give me his P.O. Box address so I can submit them immediately. Cause I am definitely uninterested in blowing out my intestines.
I‚Äôm so glad you had a lovely time! And you gave so many other people a good experience, too!
Yes, I filed for a protective order. Other than that, there is no happy ending with a narc.
As a fellow browns fan, unfortunate enough to be born into a browns family and in ohio... Hello sharer of a lifetime of heartbreak.
You have to spit into a plastic vial. It would take some decent effort to pull that off.
If there was ever such thing as a tasteful neck beard this is it. Such a beautiful bird
Nice vid, is this a modded server? I see that sexy G36...
Umm, zoom out. The ICO was $0.30. I only put 0.5 BTC into it then though. Wish I did more.
Short answer: No. Long answer: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
Yeah, guess I'm old fashioned and don't downvote people clearly expressing a personal opinion. No matter.
DEMOCRATSPF ARE LITERALLY HITLER!!!!
Why so hateful. I feel sorry for you.
Best doggo ever
But perhaps it opens a door to your escape from a lifetime of dealing with that. I would call it a fortuitous misstep.
That's how Catholicism works.
Dudes karma is -99 lol
Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!
The game felt like an awesome sci-fi TV series, with each mission feeling like a great episode. The pacing of this game was damn near perfect.
Lol shit yeah.
Keep playing ‚Äò18, save your money on ‚Äò19 and go buy beer.
[NAME] and [NAME] are the only reason to tune in at this point. Happy birthday!
Fuck that guy for game 2
[NAME] just think of how overworked her liver and kidneys must be!!
Yes - thank you for stating it this way - perfectly said.
I love your art style, that looks fantastic!
Not so sure. I have a decent body but until I took the time to focus on my posture I was slouching.
I was teased for being a virgin when I was a 6th grader- in 2005
I was 10 years old when this happened and seeing her heartbroken dad on tv and hearing her story still haunts me.
That man deserves a good whiskey. Hook him up.
Kinda sad to laugh at people who really need serious help.
This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
I think it quite apparent I was being satirical in saying Mississippi.
Actually, fascism is considered a far-right ideology. Most tenets of fascism are incompatible with Marxist ideology, just fyi.
Pretty telling about Pewdiepie‚Äôs fan base when you look at the comments and the like/dislike ratio on [NAME] Pewdiepie video.
(*ÔæâœâÔæâ) O-okay senpai OWO *Nuzzles* Frick off I write whatever I want!
This is gold!!!!! Im impressed. Very accurate.
Exactly. It's like a deepity only longer and wronger.
Cheers, brother. What are you doing to meet women? 
we live in a wooooshiety
so did [NAME], she really held back
I wanted to see him show out over Kemba.
[NAME] just keeps hopping backwards and forwards in time with no repercussions?
Clear disregard for the Turf Protection Act:
This is the kinda stuff that is cute in romantic comedies. It just depends on how much you like him.
Yeah i didn‚Äôt say i had the answers. I‚Äôm just hoping for the best
I was there too! I remember it was a warm day during an otherwise cold time of year.
And she would would enjoy wearing
You are the only real person i can look at soo noo
Ugh I never thought I'd be someone that gets jealous about shoes, which ones did you get?
That's a cute kitty :3
But all-Korean teams don't always do the best in OWL/Contenders, look at Outlaws v. Seoul, etc... 
I can‚Äôt look at [NAME] with this hair!
You want to fix them. You can‚Äôt. This was a hard life lesson for me to learn. I also am a giant loser magnet.
There isn‚Äôt a perk tree for strategy. Either illusion or maybe pickpocket... or sneak.
For as long as she‚Äôs been gone, I‚Äôm terrified to think why she was kept alive that long.
Instagram is the only one to blame for all this evil
Wimbledon‚Äôs instagram posted about [NAME] and his relationship with the Open and I ended up crying. Not ready for him to hang it up
HYS is the worst Internet comments section. It makes Youtube comments look like Gardeners Question Time.
Yeah, I don't think [NAME] supporters should use intelligence as a reason to talk down to people. I have watched [NAME] speak. Yikes.
I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
So it gets flipped to him being corrupt when he doesnt side with [NAME] as I said.
You're a man sleeping with a man. Ok.
Just eat it after. Lol. Im kidding, but it would honestly be the best recycling option. Not that anyone is going to do it. 
I was under the impression that [NAME] also has some pretty rough health problems.
Nowadays I get nervous watching Steelers defense. Back then, I couldn't wait to see what they'd do next.
Underrated comment.
Congrats! Glad it went well for you!
[NAME] is a gem and I love him but he should really be a DH somewhere
Was just in the Grampians over the long weekend. Haven't been there in 20 years. Still love it.
I came. So smooth. So brutal.
Im glad to hear it !!!
Yea I tossed that one on the pile as a insult to myself and likely many, many others. 
That‚Äôs what makes this scene so timeless. every one of us simultaneously relates to both the nerd and to homer.
Orisa will actually fair better than most if the orisa has good fortify usage. Mainly decreases effectiveness for dva and rein.
Probably just rattling the people that know they did something wrong, but now you've gone and gotten me to speculate too
Lol Well you don't know how many miscarriages occur
Except of course that's not what I said. Autists like you like to live in a fantasy life.
How many troops in Syria?
Yes please. What's that @ ?
Good idea, brought to the table by a questionable at best minister, likely for the purpose of shifting focus away from his failures. 
Yup [NAME] got cucked
Fuck that, he can go to Cleveland with [NAME] on that bullshit.
What a biotch
No, she tried and failed lmao
The one with the hot honey is also fantastic. Touch of heat and just a hint of sweet. Good food.
"The correct response for OP: ""In that case... Would you like to watch a porno on my flat screen mirror?"""
IMO it's time to go, wth would you put up with that
Makeup is magic my friend!
I'm with you - I feel no connection....
Good luck remembering that where you left it and then tearing your house apart for 1.5 hours trying to find it.
That is so cool!
I honestly hope you do that
I love how when a girl flees saudi arabia in fear of her life she gets called a drama queen. This right here is a drama queen.
Someone else mentioned the council of Rome (382), but I‚Äôll look into Carthage (397) and Hippo (393). Thank you!
That‚Äôs always good to be away from toxic people like that. Try to keep yourself from those types of people, they can ruin your life.
With [NAME] at over 30m (on average), our 2nd expensive player is only at 14.7m? Wow...
Lol really?
I never saw this tweet. That just about clears it up then
How pretentious do you have to be to say ‚Äúidk if you know who that is tho‚Äù after saying what your favourite band is
We can but no other person. Not a spouse or kids no one.
She should have her medical license revoked because she took an oath to do no harm
Hello, Do you need a student ID for anywhere in the process? I have a valid email but can‚Äôt find my ID right now. Thanks
Can Diggle put a bullet in him already
Maybe unpopular but I never eat pancakes with syrup. Way too damn sweet.
I just watched this episode the other day. I was MORTIFIED. I like seasoned chicken, but not that kinda season no
It‚Äôs never funny if you explain the joke smh
I'm so happy for you !
It's funny to imagine that they're calling [NAME], a married man, an incel.
The joys of being raised by a child psychologist... Lab rat childhood...
Well at least we won't have to spend as much time watching this.
Excited to see this kid in red and black some day
That‚Äôs absolutely fantastic but I literally was only pointing out the last time I can remember Connecticut being in the national spotlight.
Rough. Poor woman.
Yes, it can. But I don't think anyone interprets it that way here.
I use them to lean against cause my lower back often hurts. But then again, any pillow could do that 
When you see this format you know its cancer
Should of said athlete
I was too mad to continue with the second episode lol I see now that he's married and think HOW?
when you want a switch, you want a switch i guess
Thanks for this. I appreciate everyone involved.
Guns == Katanas. People need to recognize this so gun obsession stops being 'cool' with virgins.
Oh gosh it's on the website too.... Here we go
Imagine making a homophobic joke when your name is /u/Lebronlover23 OOF.
[NAME]? Rape? I am shocked I tell you! SHOCKED!
One Ô∏èig shlong
why not both? go under-cover. in both senses
That's not true. There are people that genuinely want to cause harm to people and don't care about reactions.
You mean FUStrated, it's [NAME] here :)
now imagine its some drunk 20 year old sitting near you screaming things every couple of minutes because thats whats its like in the stands
What documentaries would you recommend? I want to see it.
I've been a huge fan of them since the early days was wondering about this for so long! Glad they explained it/are alright now!
Yup. I‚Äôm assuming cause it‚Äôs live crawfish and early in the season? Idk. I love crawfish cafe but not for that price.
People label him as hysterical but he‚Äôs probably one of the calmest amongst [NAME] on Twitter IMO.
"What do you want out of this situation? To be friends? Or are you still thinking that she is going to ""come around"""
[NAME] some of these post i read on this sub its just getting too ridiculous
Let's go boys
He had that one goal last season against....someone, [NAME] I think. He's in good health other than that.
*crying* I only created this user 2 days ago and I have to wait 30 days to create subreddit UGGGGGHHHHH
Level 50 and I started playing a few days after launch. And I've been playing whenever I had free time to finish those daily orders.
You're not my STBXH hehe. He doesn't type like you.
>call people faggots > lovingly describe the beauty and strength of a man's physique
You‚Äôre gonna miss some high quality content. Just this month he‚Äôs posted two mirror selfies and mentioned [NAME] a chill 5,000 times. 
Good for you for shutting that door! You are not responsible for him. He‚Äôs a grown ass man who made his own mistakes.
The problem I had was them painting the majority of men under this flag and then saying some are changing. Most men are not predators.
Sounds like your location overall sucks. Have you ever thought about getting a work visa elsewhere with a more accepting attitude?
That little weak jog back by iwobi after his attempted cross would enough to get [NAME] dropped from the team sheet by [NAME]. Where's the accountability?
Thanks, I appreciate that. It's about what I expected though. Sadly, I'm used to it.
You are welcome mr/ms [NAME]
this is a weird timeline we live in. i can't wait to hear folky late 00's adult contemporary singer songwriter songs about this meme of a movie
U dumb.
This momentum control by the refs is killing us, and we're letting it
It's like...I knew where this was going and I still laughed.
Roasted Brussels sprouts with they get kinda charred!! Nom nom nom
That‚Äôs just silly.
I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!
Pretty much every Punjabi dude I've met.
Hi [NAME], I love you, that is all. Can't wait to see you in Worcester in February!
Yes. A couple days ago
Definitely not looks, but confidence and body count? Absolutely.
He‚Äôs not that into you. Move on.
But California (with strict, sensible gun 
[NAME] game sucks. He's good at comps but his strategic game is awful
I tell them I've been a fan since the very beginning of the franchise, so there's no way I could be a bandwagoner
Glad you got her back! Fantastic way to start off the new year with good news!
I just want to be alone in a cabin up north near flagstaff.
you seem like the kind of person i‚Äôd like to be best friends with! :)
[NAME] is great
Yeah it sort of sucks now.
...it was a corgi, and that dog looked happy as hell.
this is def an ad to buy doritos, but ill be goddamned if its not a pretty cool recipe
Best form of government is 150 people tribe in a situation where there are no non-perishable goods, just food an clothes. 
Nationally calling them feral with the implication that they had it coming less than a week after their deaths is even worse than spitting on their graves.
Probably one everytime I run out of the $1 million, 97% success rate? Worth the risk 
I got mine on the exact same mission!
El oh el that was fucking funny
I know. Honestly, I'm applying to other districts. Tired of 56 miles round trip daily for a miserable job. 
Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è I really appreciate your comment
Your username makes me think you would appreciate this joke of mine.
I wonder why they're single?
That‚Äôs blasphemous üò©
Aw jeez [NAME], we went from 2D to 2D...
Rewatching the game since I was in transit during the 4th quarter... You weren't kidding. [NAME] was a monster defensively.
Thanks for doing the job well. :)
You blew it. They played you like a fiddle.
Yes its far from remaining, its even more heavily in favour of the EU than that
I'm not sure why [NAME] would care about the backstop. Maybe he just wants to rile up the Tories.
Daaang [NAME] lost weight!!!! Is she making a comeback?
I'm not commenting on their chemistry or whatever, just that the age gaps are similar and it's ok to point that out either way.
I‚Äôm shaking rn
This is beautiful
LOL you are mental ,love it
> But it says progressive right in their name.... Here's a beautiful girl for you... ^^/s
I've debated shaving my head just to avoid this. My haircuts often get stretched several extra weeks because i'm dreading it.
So it's okay when [NAME] does it. But when I do it. I'm being weird. I see. Got it.
Oh damn, it‚Äôs gonna hunt me down. 
BITCH HER PROMO EVEN DID SCREAMS LIKE A WINNER!!!!
Shes a classy juggalette
Thanks for all the down votes!
He may have thought he had time but I really can't comment on his frame.of mind
Thanks for checking it out man. I was definitely gonna add that song right when it came out, [NAME] is awesome
"""*[NAME], what's your favourite 80s band?*"" ""*New ORDERRRR!*"""
That‚Äôs a pretty high amount to pay per week over here, don‚Äôt know about the us though.
Trash pick up vehicle driver. Uh.. a garbage man?
[NAME] IS SO HAPPY AND SO AM I!! Edit: [NAME] I see you, relax
Lmao it wasn‚Äôt free, we were stealing
You don‚Äôt need Radom sex, you will find a man who will give you what you need. Love,respect,and well.. you know..
Yeah but you don't know if they're responsible for 2018 yet. Have to wait another year.
Can you imagine the [NAME] brothers getting pitched by a woman who believes in chemtrails
OMG if the [NAME] and [NAME] run... I'll have the worst of time deciding who to vote for!
That is definitely an unpopular opinion. Upvoted.
this made me stop subconsciously breathing and now I can't stop thinking about it
[NAME] has stolen my heart.
I find this sooooo strange
Delete your account.
Good ol retro windows
I love that place I actually went their for my prom pictures
"honestly no, just thought this was a teacher trying to be ""hip"" with the students and failing miserably. "
Something something don't fight what you hate, save what you love.
I can shit on [NAME] and [NAME] as well if you'd like ;) Viva [NAME]
Looks fun up there
Congrats dude!
Disgusting of you [NAME] you filthy who're you pedophilic scum trying to beguile our children it's not gonna work I got [NAME] castorated
No. We have the same desire. No one should be told how to live.
...and they're gone. Didn't even get to see what they cost.
And somehow everyone in the sub is a saint who would never do this
It can swim tho, right? Couldn‚Äôt it just get some speed and hop up on the ice if it fell in?
Oh okay, thank you!! 
kind of funny considering that the fentanyl that is killing people in North America - Canada and USA - comes from China.
I was so worried for the kitty the whole story.
You would never attack someone's character.
It was so great to have a nice friendly NPC like that. Just one student that didn't hate our guts.
Right! I wish that fool would throw in some examples.
[NAME] in Congress are fine with with beefing up Border Patrol but [NAME] wants his goddamn wall.
It‚Äôs been posted dozens and dozens of times since last night. People fucking suck.
This is one of the worst written posts I've seen on this sub for a while
I‚Äôm as terrified of Mr. [NAME] just as much as any sane person but I don‚Äôt think we should *burn* him...
"I'm pretty sure most ""pick up"" artists in Asia pay the girls."
Oh I went balls to the wall and got SUPER SPECIFIC!!!
I was just going to say she looks like she‚Äôs silently trying to ask strangers for help in a kidnapping situation
*I curse you to an eternity of walking barefoot on a world of Lego!*
Me too, I've heard before that I'm too blunt and I feel bad about it at times
Or... Or you can eat mine.
True, my bad. 
LOL to your family
I sure hope so! Otherwise, I've been in the wrong sub.
According to Skyrim, me and 90% of the population are inner stealth archers.
So so happy, more than you believe 
pay me $92,000 dollars and Ill stay single forever lmao
Had no idea, they refused this type of deal in the past with other companies.
RNG-based access to very important mechanics is frustrating for some people.
>Apple convienently provided an adapter. If they left the headphone jack, why couldn't I just use an aux cord?
Not for off from a quadruple double in the near future...
Thanks for your advice.

How to flush your money away
1. Use chicken thighs 2. Dryness doesn't matter with this much fat.
Yes! And also when you accidentally look at someone and think that they think that you're checking them out or something.
Incredible how you can... SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME!!!
Did you mean all of Massachusetts or just Boston? Because I'm pretty sure Western Mass drives well.
I‚Äôm having a counseling this weekend ... nothing to be scared.... just tell them about your feelings and what are you worrying about..
She's not more than 17. And I love teenage [NAME]. Don't want her adult.
So what? I was being facetious. Though I will admit is a low hanging fruit and pretty cringy.
Go back to bed, grandpa
That‚Äôs my mission :) thank you so much
I guess if you want to ignorantly label people you know nothing about then I'm whatever you care to imagine me as
I'm confused. Is this post finished or is u done?
It wasn't a good idea then... it's been 10 years, why do you still think this was funny?
It seems our pets have all...turned away from [NAME] and into libtards! If only they had finished that sentence!
Seems like more of a Candyland type of guy.
I like him a lot but I assume he would be a prime piece in any trade for a LD.
Oh my goodness I was there yesterday! Luckily I didn't get bitten.
The old ‚ÄúI had sex with your mom‚Äù joke. I chuckled a little.
If you are at the stage where you want to quit then all you have to do is believe you can quit
The air can kill you at this temperature.
All that gumbo
Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary 
what does gl even stand for can't find it while searching gl mmorpg
Let's do that now and take [NAME] back.
I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs real
>Why are you so worried about my comments when you live in Wisconsin ...what?
I like your name.
Wouldnt believe that much, surely rather stay and win the league first, cant blame him tbh
Hahaha, that's a good one. 
Sling yoghurt hahaha omg x I‚Äôm 19 yeh so pretty young but what a phrase
Heyyy bear hug!
stay safe man
Thanks you!
Thanks, as a Vietnamese [NAME], I love cheap Viet lunches!
Could‚Äôve been a Morton lad if we didn‚Äôt get snaked
He‚Äôs had nightmares ever since the storm
This is racist
[NAME]. Starring [NAME] as the goofy and lovable [NAME].
We did it, finally?! Idk weird timing.
Love how she actually cross referenced the picture with the POTUS.
Are you confessing to not being able to understand what this sub is about?
Ok just making sure i was confused
REVENGE GAME ‚Äî a former [NAME] is going to go off today... [NAME] DROPPING 40
No dude. This person has two sick kids and is taking you back to their place... yeah, just no. 
Yeah that is the consensus I got for sure. Looking for a new place to live lol
One of my cats always eats the other ones food. I never noticed it until he was obese. I'm not gonna make that mistake again.
Unless they end up with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] (or similiar), this will be a huge failure. Yikes.
This is probably the most realistic if we throw in a 1st, 
There was an article about it in E news. I pray for everyone, no one is above that or below that. 
Those guys are dolphinetly not putting her down far enough to get the ball on porpoise.
You are unfortunately far and few between.
And when guys your age are getting to be too old for long term contracts.
I love this woman.
Ouch. Hurts because it's true.
Yeah I know what you meant. Fuck the police, most of them are vile pieces of shit, they deserve every kick in the back they get.
Oh, so that's where I left my cigar
Could be between [NAME] and [NAME] based on Twitter followers
I know what I said son
. The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.
Religion is absolutely a problem. But to say the left doesn't have its own analogues is ridiculous.
Wanting America to be better does not mean hating America. We can do better than [NAME]. He‚Äôs an embarrassment to the entire country.
Nothing of value lost then. They didn't really give a shit before so it doesn't matter now. Move on and cultivate new relationships.
Here's a purple heart for you recapping that! OMG matching romantic scoots I'm cryin'
I just heard about this, its pretty cool. 
My mother did this to me and it took years to get everything fixed. Almost cost me my job.
Yooooooou are the ooooooocean's gray waaaaaaaaves...
Happy Fellow Confection Icon Day!
[NAME]? Never heard that word before haha. Well her parents seem very easy going and happy people but lets see when i actually meet them.
Tell her, it may have been a huge [NAME] fan and I was even shorter than [NAME].
I thought I actually saw that happen in a clip
The straw manning in this sub is ludicrous.
Yeah probably should've chosen a better sub, but I couldn't think of one
I'm actually surprised none of his wives have stabbed him in his sleep already. Now he has secret service protection üòã
I was just watching the episode last night. So adorable.
Who the hell is that. I only got my account 2 months ago
Why does [NAME] have extra nipples on his arms?
I downloaded this album yesterday, and love it!
I'm sure the guy posting is this just gorgeous with the best personality ever
Is there proof this happened or is it just her accusation? I'm asking because we already know she's a liar.
"Teacher: ""ok guys, put your phones down (and definitely don't send me the link)"""
He is actually good now. No teddy but he was great last year before he got into shit
Fuck her... don‚Äôt live to make your parents happy
I don't care anymore.
It does with PIA
Must be a couple of Alt Left students at Berkeley Cummunist University.
Maybe for the last 8 minutes.
I‚Äôm in a similar situation, but mine is my spanish teacher she favorites the boys, and she really just hates me
Ugh I wish!!! You‚Äôre not in the US?
To be fair [NAME] and Unite were both cleared of wrongdoing.
You're the reason Publix was out of meatballs today. Hmph!
You came here to cry
Everytime? So 3 times a day you rewatch the bloopers and deleted scenes? How often do you repeat, probably weekly?
I'm in the UK dude. It's happening everywhere and most people are either busy hating or living in a bubble so are oblivious.
You're not. OP just couldn't follow some of the simplest rules on reddit.
It's probably because your posts are extremely dumb and bigoted
> 82 percent of black voters trusting [NAME] and two percent trusting [NAME] Seems kinda high for [NAME] lol
Thanks for sharing. They also have an Amazon wishlist (linked from the comfortcases page) as another way to donate!
If the doctor has given the ok, give some ibuprofen for teething pain FFS!
Rare just announced they plan to fix it but don't hold your breath it could be a month or more
That's the worst urinal ever.
Now THAT'S a victory royale :)
My height is definitely a huge (ironically) factor. Im 5'1 no girl would date a guy 5'1.
We saw them last year from Baker Beach. So many whales!
That slightly yellow tint of the water after boiling.
All voting has all sorts of problems. Struggling to find a point to your post.
Get in touch with a lawyer. No one in Reddit can answer this. Throwing her out really would be better.
Summer Beaver, nice place. 
I always thought the GNT version of 10:14 was amusing. Intelligent people talk sense, but stupid people need to be punished. Proverbs 10:13 GNT
That really sucks. How old is your baby?
Thanks man! That feels good to hear. I‚Äôm glad someone is on my side and finally understanding how I feel about this season.üòÑüëç
The US version of The Office isn‚Äôt even the best version of The Office, never mind the best comedy ever.
Yes. Many wedding parties don't know what to do with the ring bear after the vows, so there are many up for adoption.
Consider yourself lucky haha. I used to call my local radio station daily to request they play it ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes.
Not evenly proportional, and not what I said. I'm talking just overall shape for proportion. I like a mom belly.... They're pretty sexy.
Ok [NAME] just take a deep breath.
The children are still being abused, neglected and treated like rubbish. White Australian policy has been horrific and continues to be horrific.
I hate losing to the Blackhawks like I love my wife: Intensely.
I remember a countdown for when the [NAME] twins turned 18 too. Thought it was pretty gross.
This is probably the clearest and most concise explanation I've ever encountered for why authoritarian religions seem to focus on trivial behaviors. Thank you.
Don‚Äôt worry; I‚Äôm sure your dad will come back from the store any day now.
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thought that.
This is an interesting opinion that I want to brainstorm some more. I'd like to see a study on how global warming would affect Canada's habitability.
Yeah 150 is a little much. Reverting to 125 would be perfect
It's a tool that idiots install so they can tag users who post in subreddits they disagree with and immediately discount or attack said users
What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.
"[NAME]: ""I wish I won't get robbed of a victory again"" [one finger of the monkeys paw curls]"
Pulled from IG. IDK where it originated so no credit given. It's just making the rounds.
Their fault for being so tasty
Think they fly in tonight or tomorrow?
You are wrong.
No cocaine? London will collapse.
When your 25 and it‚Äôs your first kiss.... No one wants to be a 25 yr olds first kiss.
Did not realize [NAME] hair game is that fire
Did anyone else notice [NAME]' face twitching a little?
Couldn‚Äôt find my wallet for the last 4 days. This also happens to be an awesome way to not spend any money.
I'm so broke that I'd take if you're still looking. I'm a guy though.
Someone with erectile dysfunction already can't (conventionally) orgasm. What the fuck are you talking about?
Hey this is right around the corner from where I live! The skyline viewed from those little park peninsulas along Lakeshore are definitely some of my favorite sights.
[NAME] has had this problem forever. Hopefully she fixes it, because it gets old and is a relationship killer 
No way! First I‚Äôm hearing about this
Interesting take there
Whoa whoa whoa, dont go firing him into the rest of us. He is your alien being
Oops, guess youre straight now!
dude imagine how [NAME] felt when he copped a full powered one from Barboza.
All the time
Where's her british accent? lol I love to dislike her videos <3
The poor car.
Damn, you just reminded me how good that feels...
This is amazing!! Will it be integrated with the 7th heaven mod collection?
[NAME] face looks like some actress/model who I can picture in my head but I cant remember her name
This is the scariest thing I think I‚Äôve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
"""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s"
He‚Äôll probably get [NAME] to do his work for him.
Not just commercial property owners. Large stakeholders such as HOAs of condo owners were also involved.
That 2nd goal was all [NAME]. What a move, and against the best team in the league!
I'm sorry your trust has been that badly broken.
oh id love to hear it if you ever find it. he is one of my all time favorite authors
Hard to follow after reading his post history. Says he is divorced...
Don't give yourself so freely to people who don't value you.
No it isn't. Not much than your OP. You just have nothing outside of your feelings.
Like a low budget version of this amazing game show
You're getting downvoted because every one of your comments is condescending af
Oh no the poor man
Cause his value is at the lowest now.. If he does improve and score goals for Monaco, he'll be sold in the summer. 
My birthday is in March, so that MK11 Beta access is also going to be awesome.
> What plans should I use to hide the scent of a decaying body? Can you bottle up his farts? Seriously.
My favorite!
Considering most people voted for their candidate purely out of hate for the other candidate does that even matter?
Thought they would be his least favorite band
True. You always gotta be careful. It's pretty sad actually. I feel used and abused.
>West Covina That just happens to be where [NAME] lives!
Being so gullible is the frightening part. durr da durr he downvote me
This is infuriating but what‚Äôs also infuriating is missing all of our chances and players being constantly in offsides positions
I‚Äôve made candies almonds and cashews in a slow cooker before. They‚Äôre surprisingly not mushy or soggy.
I would get up and gently wake the guy-he could have broken his jaw-
Dump her. Shes not committed to you
remember when he scored 4 tries in a game? that was cool
And then there was the on who grabbed mom‚Äôs breast and tried shoving ot onto the ba y‚Äôs mouth.
Yeah lets hope so, i hear the IRA is very forgiving of rich folk.
But what about terminal pulp space infections that can lead to osteomyelitis of terminal phalanx? The reasoning I read was thrombosis of end artery.
"What part of ""Yeah but still"" do you not understand dude?"
Psst...If no one sees you while eating it, you didn't actually eat it
I just can‚Äôt. I love you [NAME], thanks for the laughs always x 
That's exactly why I'm asking you if you would.
You'll feel better about yourself if you don't act like an asshole to people who care about you.
Thankyou so much
Omg, unbelievably scary. Insane 
It doesn't matter if 99% didn't vote for him, it only maters that he got 50% +1 of the seats.
You've never been to England have you?
Follow the Colts strategy this year. Stack your O Line and protect the most important and best player on your team.
Stop thinking about yourself. Go help someone and work hard at being useful. There's no satisfaction or fulfillment in self-obsession. Get over yourself.
my heart...
Eastern European here. Very cool! We‚Äôre really all the same.
One of the podcasts I listen to, pump talks, bought one from [NAME] for a girls birthday and apparently it was very sweet! 
You‚Äôre a vet; you at least WERE poor lol. I‚Äôm a vet too dude I know the struggle.
I kinda feel like you may be my auntie. Florida?
TIL the President is not an adult. Actually IL that a long time ago.

Teeth. I really want good teeth and my hair is nice and easily maintainable atm

Battle of the Bastards
Damn I wish I we're friends with [NAME]. I could use 197k
Happy Cakeday!
Are you seriously this dumb?
Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof.
There's an Arby's/Long John Silvers near where I live. I'm glad they don't cross menu items.
What did it say
If she's making inapropriate claims thats a problem too, Im not exactly sure what your point is?
clearly no one is getting my joke oof.
"It's ""Lo and behold"" just fyi"
It was magic.
if it shatters your little ego i'm fine with this. :)
So sounds like she was raped, and she seriously needs to press charges, this bartender needs to be raped in prison big time.
Predatory towing is getting ridiculous. I have up to date stickers for all the properties I maintain and have been towed twice. Fuck em.
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU‚ÄôRE ANNOYING AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO END A RELATIONSHIP THAN A HILARIOUS FACEBOOK POST
haha I'm guessing she doesn't spark joy for you, so you can let her go 
After I got rammed into by 2 planes on the 1st zone's storm edge in dusty, I couldn't agree more.
Was at the game yesterday and at the game now. It's a miserable gong show. Why do I keep doing this to myself?
I have no idea how we are down by ONLY 13. Its truly a miracle.
What are you apologizing for? Vent bro, that‚Äôs why we are here
Presuming you are in the mitten as well. Solidarity sister. My house too looks like a bomb went off and my toddler hates clothes.
Man I just hope for a good ole fashion W
Damn, that's the only war we lost. 
I like [NAME]‚Äô ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of losing, I‚Äôm not a loser‚Äù
Love the [NAME]. They have a great dynamic and it looks like a genuine friendship.
Oh man, I didn't know that. No wonder he has no care for it. Does he have any post secondary education?
Always toward absent lovers love's tide stronger flows.
Outdoor cats have less than 1/3 the lifespan of indoor cats. 5 years rather than 17.
No because prize drafts still aren't serious play dude.
No, mom doesn‚Äôt like fights and my sisters afraid of getting hit (even though he doesn‚Äôt hit her)
Don‚Äôt like blood of the dead by the looks of it.
Thanks, I guess.
I absolutely love that idea. I went on an anniversary trip with a couple once and it was amazing! We had so much fun.
He‚Äôs a brave man.
i ended his misery by kicking him off the cliff his brother will take his place
Wow, thanks whoever did the silver‚ù£ put a ray of sunshine into an otherwise cloudy day! 
You‚Äôre dehydrated and exausted, drink lots of water and maybe get some sleep. You‚Äôll feel better eventually.
To be honest I miss the deep bomb on 3rd and 2. Watching the Browns game reminded me how I always love when it worked.
Still looks pretty delicious, makes me really want an omelette rn tbh
I guess the caveat is that is a world championship offyear where not all players are available due to playoffs
Be brave. You have our support
Is that the one that accuses [NAME] and [NAME] Rector as well?
It kind of blew my mind to see that after reading some of the most generic advices in that post. Who the f* upvote these posts?
What loser feels superior cause they have airpods tho
I‚Äôm intrigued.
This is spicy
I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.
Hate to see him go. The only thing I‚Äôm complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
They visit. But they don't stay
Best I've ever had came out of a Disney cookbook my daughter brought home from
Can you explain this?
volunteer as tribute first, we need an example that we can follow :)
Why do you feel like you have to figure out what life is alone?
OP got woodshed lmao
I‚Äôm so glad I have my own car
Apparently, his knees aren't as bad as we thought.
If he‚Äôs American...then he‚Äôs fucked
The next step in human evolution is for humanity to end. Life isn't worth preserving.
He wasn‚Äôt a US citizen.
Great for moderate sedation in the ER!
Guys message got deleted, what did he say? 
HAHAHAHA... Damn it.... I knew that was coming. Alright, I will try to upload it into this thread on my lunch break.
No, you want *humanity* to do its thing by contacting these people and killing them. Hence you want them to die.
Thanks, fixed it
Just do intermittent fasting, then you can pretend it's an interesting lifestyle choice and make that your new hip personality
redemption island? I'm not judging if you like it just curious
It still has the potential to be permanent if no alternative is found.
Victim victim victim. From your comments I can tell you think the world is out to get you.
37 here, happily single. And the majority of my friends who got married at 23/24 are getting divorced now. 
Meaning of life is to work 8h + a day and then convert your lifetime in coins you can spend on useless shit.
they place it neatly in the basket and the ball thanks them for their manners
No group... I didn't say the guy's plan was realistic haha
Aw you seem upset, you are obsessed with talking shit about me. This move is indefensible.
That is awful. :(
wow your the best, you take away all my anxiety...EDIT IT CAME BACK
Wait until you‚Äôre at least 25 to get a tattoo. You‚Äôll more than likely regret it otherwise.
Halep just can‚Äôt handle Kanepi, #1 is about to be wide open
Wow, I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that at all. What a crazy situation! Poor woman!!

Art Director in advertising/marketing design.
To be fair how often has someone drafted in the top 5 not immediately joined the team.
You can see flairs and select them on the desktop version. You can‚Äôt see them on mobile.
I wonder how many managers you've pissed off
She just looks sick. Very pale.
that's not scarcity its desperation and prioritizing looks over everything else
Then YOU go right ahead...support and guide him.
You just need to yell Calibrations and he'll be right there
I was actually a little lost here and there for an episode or two because I didn't remember everything from season 1. It came back to me though
No phone, can't help....sorry?
This looks really cool. r/twobestfriendsplay would love this.
I have faith that she will realise she deserves better. She's a strong lady.
Don't make me cry...P.S. Happy cake day!
Hahahah that‚Äôs actually really funny no judgment here, do you friend
And some do it because they think it's funny.
Stupid [NAME] referencing that stupid seagull/cricket myth
Half right I am 15 but I‚Äôm not a goth and just enjoy the taste of human mostly blood but flesh is almost as good
Thanks, now every highlander I run into tries to do it 100% of the time and I just bait them into a light parry
How dare you put x on the same level as [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] that's disgusting
Forever this.
What, again? This stupid country!
People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
Yeah is saw that. Poor [NAME] :D
Tsunderes never work
Go slowly and don‚Äôt pressure yourself but rake advantage of some adult company for an evening out if the opportunity presents itself. Best wishes
Cuddling. Lots of cuddling
Curious about your thoughts on BC‚Äôs LNG activity.
"yeah her ex was shocked when she said ""my boyfriend""."
> All the complexity was lost in Oblivion, and it was a huge disappointment. So you are agreeing with me?
Thank you all for the karma I‚Äôve gotten!
[NAME] might be up your alley, friend. 
Busy? Focused on long-term goals?
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm agreeing with [NAME].
It pains me to see [NAME] used in this abhorrent meme
your* and you're* btw
Let‚Äôs go [NAME]!!
i agree to kill all children
Ugh, the learning curve for hurdles has to be a painful one... kudos for finishing. Last couple falls probably destroyed her knees. 
Thanks for confirming ‚ò∫!
Fabies? fababies? fatbabies? but fat babies are so cute.
Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... Little emotions
If the cops don't let you win 30% of the time, stop asking them to play.
How can we expect to devise useful interventions if we don't accept the reality of the situation?
We don't undervalue him, almost any and all experts thing he is just not worth his contract.
You have to be REALLY old to be too old to appreciate rap music. Rap music started in the 1970s.
You'd better get to work then! See you in 10 years!
[NAME] speed RL üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The joke doesn't even have anything to do with the song.
That's what I thought too man
Wait a minute
I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning her self and had a discharge, so what? 
I stopped watching after I had to suffer through a whole episode without [NAME] removing his shirt
[NAME] why would you blow your load on your fucking suit with fur on it
This gave me a laugh on this shity day thank you
"I always laugh at the statement above. ""Qualified to give a urine sample?"" ""Huh?"""
Feel free to PM me, I was a longtime vegetarian before transitioning to veganism.
I like to think it rhymes with wasabi but I have no idea
It's all fun and games until somebody loses an ear.
That comparison system could backfire when hogs see their 83rd percentile healing and go ‚Äúwhat the fuck were our healers doing I have 83rd percentile healing‚Äù
What a stupid stretch lmao.
I don't think aspergers causes me distress or anxiety. I think having to live in a society that privileges neurotypical modes of interaction causes me distress and anxiety
Totally amazing that some peoples' egos can't even handle being honked at.
I'll take two please good ser.. How many chickens do I owe you ?
[NAME] has the same amount of points as [NAME]
Condiments suck. Mostly because I love them so much. Why cant they just be free calories?!?!
Well why did you respond to me rather than starting your own comment thread?
Honestly I realized they‚Äôre not really gatekeeping, but [NAME] last comment shows the gatekeeping
My brother looks like [NAME] and I look like [NAME]
Is that [NAME]?
That‚Äôs impressive you can tell that from the back of his head
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure you're right and he's wrong 
Should I say (sent to all) after I say snap back to snap more?
As I understand if our Libel laws had been as shitty as the ones in the UK he could.
I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
"I hid there just about everytime. Was often the person complaining about, ""stop dying"", and, ""hide BEFORE he hits 4 meat""."
It's just sad; she was just nice and normal before she messed with her looks
I started out by being sick.. and the realization that no one is going to help me... Not even my family not friends.
Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions
I swear no ranked team can go without losing to an unranked team for very long.... that‚Äôs why I love college basketball
Thanks, man!
It's beyond evil. It is pure demonic when it's that pure sadism and vile sick torture. I hate them guys.
It‚Äôs so weird, I think it‚Äôs like excited/stressed? 
Yeah cuz it's not like eggs ever roll over or anything. /s
People are just so used to these laws never being enforced in any meaningful way in other countries.
I hope you two can figure this out. I feel for you and for him.
You really went in to detail, and with valid points. Œî 
Unleash your RAGE, my chosen children! Unleash your rage upon the [NAME], and bring forth the age of the YELLOW

*my fat normie slut*
Nah eats the heads when he‚Äôs finished with them. I punt them so I can buy fresh meat.
Any EU countries that get tricked into nationalism become prey and weaker relative to Russia and the US.
Great minds more like... And youtube suggestions.
His Ma must be really impressed with her sharply dressed son. üëäüí¶
If I were a snake, I think I'd rather stay in my uncomfortable concrete jungle than have my mouth glued shut and be mauled by a toddler.
don‚Äôt curse mmeEEEE !
It‚Äôs been 2 hours, OP died for a noble cause.
Good, I need an hour to align my chakras for the impending stress 
I came here once accidentally, saw your commend and now, 2 weeks later, I totally understand. 
[NAME] fell asleep on defense
[NAME] can still betabuxx and have an easier life than you will if you have to be alone and support yourself with no help.
Afton is relatively small, doesn‚Äôt have very many members, and is rather close to other temples compared to Brasilia.
Just coming!
I think it is more likely that you simply do not know what science is.
Because its the internet and people are bored. Its not kids, its full grown adults and you know it. Unbunch your panties.
Not sure if /s but he's referring to the Jericho siren on the stuka
Go [NAME]!
In other news; Water is still wet.
RemindMe! April 26, 2019
The spouse sponsors them to guarantee that they are not a burden to the state. Nothing about this is related to committing a crime.
Makes sense. So I need 2 USB drives according the the TAILS website.
Most awkward looking super-athlete ever.
Hope they don't pull another [NAME] on [NAME]. Good to hear [NAME] added muscle and is healthy. Hopefully he and [NAME] can play all 16 this season
She look like any dude I use to battle rap with
She wasn't a fit parent when she molested then 5 year-old [NAME] while she was high on meth. That ship has long sailed.
I‚Äôm so sorry. Hang in there it‚Äôll get easier.
RIP. Sad for his family and the bull riding community.
I was having a good day and it still really made me feel good. Had a bad day yesterday and it's still affirming to hear so thanks!
That's Great to Hear.
Hey! Anyone have the DL on this MLM ? Would love some links to send a victim!!

Okay, thank you very much! So we are off the deep end of Riverdale logic here.
What it felt like rooting for the pats today
Anybody know why [NAME] sat the second half? It wasn't like anybody else was burning it up.
No, not at all.
Mmmmm tasty üÖ±Ô∏èestrogens
You said it wrong.
I appreciate it!
If you wanna know how rappers rape ask [NAME]
[NAME] died for our shins
Best bedtime Christmas story ever.
So you abandoned your Russian heritage for... what, exactly? The things you are describing are the result of the west screwing Russia over.
Not an unattractive man, he‚Äôs gonna need real plastic surgery to fix that. 
Black Mirror is great.
We haven‚Äôt had much luck either. We wish you and Aunt [NAME] the best. Stay strong! Thank you for the kind words.
We are doomed
That's my meds when going through interviews lol. Glad you made it!!
You‚Äôre right, republicans are worse because they have nukes.
Truth. If he had time for another relationship, he has time to pay for it. 
Ugh her mind!
I'm excited for [NAME]/ [NAME] moments. My flair(s)
That was one of the most entertaining chalenges though. That and [NAME] slamming the table
It's easier to have a discussion with a four year old. Four year olds actually want to learn new things.
Seeing [NAME] on Sunday and I'm so fucking stoked
One of these things is not like the other
He thought of it but we don't want his mother's house to be wrecked by the staff.
What it do, what it do.
They make it difficult to chant this, they go and get indicted way too soon.
Where are my testicles, [NAME]? Edit: thanks for the silver!
Really??
Glad there's someone on here with a little sanity.
Eastern suburbs, the mullet never went out of fashion.
Ask the Magic 8 Ball again later. We can't predict your future.
I wasn't meaning it as an insult or anything, sorry if it came off that way. 
I'd love [NAME] to smash some faces in.
Mother-fucking legitimate, charity fireworks!
This just makes me want sushi.
Started watching when they were up 14, thought there‚Äôs no way to be disappointed today.... oh well
Yes, I‚Äôm aware. [NAME] loves LA and he isn‚Äôt worth 18 mil so he‚Äôd gladly take it.
Scotch tape for a leak. You might have better chances just asking it really nicely to stop.
Damn, we need to get this idea to [NAME]! 
I mean, you are in love with them regardless. But I always knew when they were going through an awkward stage and such. 
Sounds pretty optimistic... I'll believe it when I see it!
I'm so sorry about your friend. What was he like?
indeed, but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly
But he is just anti Israel and definitely doesn‚Äôt hate [NAME]. /s
Into what shit? I like her but Idk she‚Äôs hella confusing
It doesn‚Äôt really matter what you mean, it matters what you say and do.
If you saw this pizza you'd have disagreed. Would have caused [NAME] to faint
I got a bipolar vibe.
I can see the rippled sandy bottom, the shark is clearly visible, the surface is near. I feel ok üòÅ
What's your best [NAME] story? You rock btw!
And it was out of their control as well for both. That's funny
Lesson #1: never but anything from Wish
He's 38 he should retire I hope he at least gets traded to a contender
Mini sun because rain pouring on you constantly will ruin everything around you like electronics
I'm here through the week. So far I've met [NAME], French and Haitian people and it's been amazing!
I get these all the time and sometimes just walk. Love downtown
Very clever!
Lmk if u come across anything
I could crush him like a bug right now.
Ok. I can support that. Do it on btc chain. Good luck. Honestly, without hiiden motives, good luck. 
I don't know about that. Old Liz managed to earn around $90k over the past couple of years.
I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
I‚Äôm not an Aub man. Check the flair.
Does anybody have a serious answer to this?
lmao he deleted his reddit account after his main got exposed, and now is making an ass out of himself in the steam forums thread again
Nail in the coffin. Sucks that refs always feel the need to call an equalizer penalty
There is insurance for stuff like that too, so maybe not always
It feels to me like your Dean has some baggage and you shouldn't let it weigh you down.
I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs gone from Detroit, but good on him for being a professional on ESPN. 
Thanks for this.
Mind if I use your allegory in my classes? It's perfect.
I am loving this exchange. At first I felt really really insecure that my sister and I are best friends and now I realize this person is ridiculous.
Seems like [NAME] got shot by the **japanising beam**
Florence, SC?? Bc if it is I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all üòÇ
> so I would never say that to someone *To* someone, or *about* someone?
This is the game that finally lost my faith.
I have died so I know something you don‚Äôt.
That's... why I'm here.
Honestly, I bet they would argue that the food was out of the car, so you‚Äôre not covered. 
This is how it should be. I'm so happy to see this post.
Beverly Hills and Wehooüëç
Also drill man exists for an alternate for Balrog.
And stole your ice cream
Booty matters MUCH more in my opinion
Wow Donkey must be smaller than I remember
He doesnt deserve the wage he's probably demanding for them to say no thanks. no injury prone and inconsistent for that.
I thought there's a top 5 and they filmed each elimination? What makes you say [NAME] isn't there (though I'd love [NAME] to be)
That's exactly what it was modelled on, MTV show as well. The pun was just begging to made so they did 
I apologise. It looks like you can be charming from time to time, not only today.
And they don't give any actual details, just a string of baseless claims. Wonderful.
Destroying the unrighteous to save the righteous is a righteous act. Therefore the great flood is an act of love. Whether it happened or didn't happen.
Oh, I felt that despondency at the end there. Poor guy. 
There are drugs for that...
Though i think i preferred it when it was artistic and gritty i still love that series. Listening to the audiobook he took the voices from. highly recomended
Really? that's very interesting
Yep gave me goosebumps.
Fair enough, but in most countries, still illegal. Also highly unethical. Then again none of you give a damn about ethics.
Yea, I saw him live in Stockholm. It was awesome!
Oh boy, yeah.
> this racist rant. Pretty amazing to drop the N word while trying to talk about incivility and decorum.
I was going to put in the post that I wanted to smack her, but here in the comments I'll say, I wanted to smack her. 
It doesn‚Äôt get better than that
Producers knew if [NAME] makes it to the ball challenge she'd kill it so hard [NAME] would just crown her instantly
You are a true hero
Happy New year! ü§ó
Such a disappointment
I'll happily answer this question if you provide a social norm to discuss. I really loath philosophical round-a-bouts on reddit.
The hand break isn't going to make already locked tires lock any more. Just sayin'.
Now ask me if I care. It's irritating and stupid.
"Reply with ""Oh, my bad"". Don't make a big fuss out of it. People make mistakes."
‚ÄúWe just need more MONEY!‚Äù
You're beautiful! Your sister is a great photographer too, this photo looks so natural! 
He always missed that key 3rd down catch to keep the drive alive
[NAME] belongs to no one.
I will absolutely tell him this. Thank you. Congrats for making it out of the fog yourself.
Thanks, ive been thibking about telling the school principal, maybe itll help
So satisfying chucking a spear and getting a few guys with one throw. Also I loved the bow in this game
lol Holy shit.
This is absolutely beautiful.
Some rambling paragraphs about what a waste I am and how sorry I am to be a disappointment to those around me and that sort.
They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
What a fucking bozo
SIGN HIM NOW GASE
It was done before and it was terrible
INJECT A GIF OF BASTIAN NODDING IN SATISFACTION FROM THE BOX INTO MY VEINS
it's so funny how the mods in that sub behave in comparison to the mods in this sub
I have two and nothing has ever happened to me. The media doesn't want you to show your support because they want supporters to feel isolated.
What a nice [NAME] sentiment!
Enjoy the ahuahuasca
Beer bottles and his ex's old stuff. Because if country music has taught me anything its that all that exists is a gun, alchohol and some girl you lost. 
> Killing an intruder in your home in self defense is now a really bad thing. That was not even under discussion.
Ah yes, resort to ad-hominem attacks when you have nothing else to say.
Now maybe :)
It's fishphobic!
Buying Bitcoin at it's peak is the equivalent of people buy Fyre festival tickets. I'm glad I did neither
Sooooo happy for you.
Apparently [NAME] is realizing that it looks bad when he isn't performing governance duties.
he dribbles softly and loosely I dont understand why nobody has fixed it.
I just mean she keeps saying never again. Again.
Whoa this is really creepy
I started the Kitty City Meowboys and I do those things. I have a mic but I don't use it because talking exhausts me
DONT RUIN THIS FOR ME
I would assume that it would be sexually frustrating for the woman.
Gotta love jetpacking.
Am I the only one that doesn't what to see this? Tag this kind of stuff, please.
Have to run some plays for him, he is guarded pretty tightly. 
I‚Äôm from Ocean County and I don‚Äôt enjoy admitting you‚Äôre right.
That would be awesome
take up english sometime, you might enjoy it.
Oh, totally mistaken - thanks for correcting me! I had read differently, but maybe that's in other states/cities?
Been saying this shit for years. Sorry not sorry
And I kinda noticed that [NAME] is a lowkey (bec of the edit) [NAME]. Just clock her reactions to ep1 and ep4 to Manila.
I love you
I love you like a love song, baby. And if you know that song, it's now in your head.
For a second, despite the title, I thought you were pouring coffee creamer on yourself and I was confused.
cars don't start, sometimes car doors are frozen shut. that's the worst of what i've experienced.
Thought I was the only one who noticed that ....
Me fail English?! That's unpossible!
What's with the click? I don't get it... It ruins the joke *hangs up*
Thank you! Much appreciated, as promised.
Get your daughter into therapy. That is some crazy manipulative shit she went through.
My target has lots of stuff. *This target had fortnite.*
Ah, gotcha 
Eh, I think that i'd rather jerk off tbh..
thats one impressive car!!
Fair enough good point
Go to highschool with the guys I went with. You'll get the hang of it in no time..
I love all Radiohead since The Bends, but I think I prefer Kid A and In Rainbows to OK Computer.
im not happy with tonight either but no need to make a bad situation worse by just bitching about everything and anything.
In the 50s my aunt was 6 weeks old when a flu virus caused inflammation of the heart and she died. So there's that, too.
Wish my life was this easy :‚Äô) Lets just hope she didn‚Äôt kill you
He gets to watch boxing for free and get paid for it. It's probably his dream job. I'm happy for him! :)
Once we win week 1 next season this sub will turn around lol
Those long legs go up and make an ass of themselves... must be in the jeans
I am sorry human being :(
I thought [NAME] the apostle was *fantastic.* Seeing those early [NAME] suffering like that really drove home what a baby I am.
Did the goal light go off? Because the scoreboard changed on SN and TSN
Or her girlfriend was a man when she started dating her
Does anyone know if Thai courts tend to let off whitey?
[NAME] doesn‚Äôt care if you drink tea. I would tell him how you feel. Keeping you in my thoughts.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but winners write history and since leave won ... */dodges incoming tomato*
I have considered that, and if is possible, I will see where it leads me, thanks.
Unrelated, but no way N‚Äôkeal [NAME] goes that high
Yep, and the worst thing is that the cost of not doing something is invisible, while the cost of doing is not!
You can't control what happens around you. You can only control how you react to it.
Damn, we barley made it out of the Rockets game with a win according to that graph. 
P=too damn high
So many great shows they killed because they didn't advertise them and put them at terrible air times :(
FWIW this was also posted yesterday
I'm laughing hysterically at midnight Thanks LMAO
Almost heaven...
Class topper meant something way different when I was growing up lol
The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?
Sorry then. My bad. Let's hope there is no full scale war any time soon btw.
Ayee aha, and Yeah don‚Äôt be afraid to go higher if everything was good!!! Lmk how it goes when you do!
Lynwood gets shady AF after dark.
I love that this gets light. Keep talking. Especially AOC. Don't stop.
Just look at Speedwagon. That man is... a beauty to say the least.
I'm too late to rub this into all the casual's faces. :(
K. Nah, it's that tablets are the full effect of it. [NAME] sporting shoes on the system that they forgot about that.
No, it's not that one
I gotchu bro, house By Gucci Mane I‚Äôm a huge Gucci mane fan. 
Your right. I just didn't want to go into depth out of laziness
That actually sounds pretty bloody hilarious. Maybe I'll work that into one of my one-shots.
This definitely sounds like bipolar mania or a schizophrenic episode. I hope he gets some help.
Scared? A little bit. It's more of a simmering disgust at this point for myself.
IMO the only draggy parts all involve the boy and his Yankee Doodle shit.
Apparently measles are worse for adults, ironically due to stronger immune systems.
[NAME] own DHS claims most drugs come in through legal points of entry. Do you have any sources to contradict that?
Reading comprehensions not your strong suit I‚Äôm guessing, no I don‚Äôt personally believe that, just pointing out an anecdote.
I'm team boneless. If it's not breaded to hell then you're getting more meat for your money.
There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.
That survival rate is skewed. It doesn't include the people who don't seek treatment because they can't afford it
So happy for you I am crying too.
!RemindMe 24 hours
This is not true, you can still cross train to short fall career fields at the half.
I would love to see [NAME] play all 60 minutes but nah. [NAME] needs to chill.
It's a seemingly a pretty heavy duty trailer but definitely putting some stress on bearing assembly slamming a log into it sideways like that.
If Spider-Man 2 is a ‚Äúfailed movie‚Äù then so is The Dark Knight and all the LOTR movies.
So you did. And now you're here talking about how it's not important.
They don't want equal rights. They want extra rights.
You Dirty F*king Heathen.
I will take 10 more years of overpowered Tracer before I enjoy having Brig as a counter
Wait...does that mean they acknowledge the 100 million figure? üëÄ
Take a really cold bath before you go to class.
I wondered if anyone else here watched Family by the Ton
I guess it's fair to say that that's one life ruined.
No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.
guidance? she needs to go to makeup bootcamp.
not true! Acute acopia needs a brief social admission, social work, and tincture of time Chronic acopia needs placement
"The loving mother referred to her son as ""the one with acne"". He's better off."
Welcome to the Wild West. It's fucking amazing.
is it a jailable offence
I‚Äôve had a hard time finding stuff in the area, occasionally Construction Junction will have a decent old handsaw or two...
I like watching old shows and movies and seeing old brands and how the logos and stuff changed.
"Lmao ""guys I was *coerced* into sending her a picture of my junk"". That just sounds dumb as hell "
Wow sold out during break without most of the students. Don't know how they'll fit the students in once we're back
Sorry. I know I should be grateful and happy.
I love it lol!
Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought
Gase looks like he's tripping balls
HAHA WE ACTUALLY ARE TERRIBLE
Btw I‚Äôm totally including myself in the karmahungry section but that pic was just too appropriate to not share
Lol... that is awesome.
It should be played between two biggest NCAA violators of the year as a punishment.
Aaaand this is why I couldn‚Äôt do online dating when I was single.
You post your pics online. Good for you! You're probably not a subhuman
Yeah I guess, still going to try to keep a log of my feelings as a way of venting them and getting them out of my head.
I like him too but when we DFAd him last year you‚Äôd have thought we cut [NAME]
Good [NAME], you are right.
Thank you üôè
She's out on the town getting banged like a screen door in a storm. You might as well have the talk.
Thanks man. We had a taste of the storm Thursday. In South Central PA, we are all ready for the shit to fall.
Your harshest critic will always be yourself
Best kiki dance I‚Äôve ever seen
but.... but the lizards would eat the bugs....?
srs that‚Äôs a cute sweater n all but i wish the pic was closer to her makeup
His main goal is attacking KSI's comment section
So you could say that this is one of very few subreddits that manages to somewhat avoid political spins and that the original commentor is a worthless shill
they're a bit expensive anyways
These [NAME] names are really beautiful!!!
[NAME] i want to slap the shit out of her
Out of curiosity, what does [NAME] think of [NAME]?
Appreciate you keeping to the bet. The other guy hasn't yet. Take care bro.
that is what retardation looks like
[NAME] was speaking as a man./s
Thats great! Just curious, what game? 
I regret not grabbing my work laptop today, then I wouldn't have to leave fort blanket until Thursday. 
[NAME] marched with [NAME]!!!
Thanks mate.
Hey mate, just know that if you need someone to talk to, I'm ready to listen. Hope things will get better for you, anyway. 
I think sweaty is hilarious in the context of r/forwardsfromgrandma which is where I see it 90% of the time
Most exciting abortion I‚Äôve ever seen.
the game certainly feels unfinished, at least on PC. some horrible mouse controls, using a controller is almost necessary.
I don‚Äôt think they are. Haksal was streaming KR ranked just a few days ago
The forgotten [NAME]? He's pretty good on the Flash as [NAME].
He was recently defending the new Brazilian president who is uh, not left at all lol
Don‚Äôt let the bastards grind you down. I‚Äôm so sorry for this experience. No one deserves to be treated that way.
Why don't Maroon 5? Regardless of the quality of the song, its been one of the most popular songs for the past 8 months
you can‚Äôt duel yourself you walnut
I mean she‚Äôs barely into college so she‚Äôs only maybe 18-20 but to be this oblivious is pretty sad.
Will be when we organise a run on the banks and hopefully take the only thing Westminster cares about away from them.
I didn't get it the first time, thank you for replying me.
[NAME] blew it by putting [NAME] on the WS roster. He was horrible, and he hadn't pitched in weeks.
If this is actually how it goes, I won‚Äôt feel so bad going from 5 to 8 in week 17.
The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
At least people don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking my talents to...‚Äù like [NAME] did in the decision.
At what time is this?
Absolutely you are doing the right thing. She will not take this decision lightly. So be prepared for the fallout now.
Truly incredible work ;)
What a beautiful memory for you to have found. So sorry for your loss ‚ù§Ô∏è
I had a similar experience. I used to be masters for a while, and now am GM. People are not very understanding of new GMs.
I liked the comeback tho
& she cancelled the vote in December because she though she'd lose.
Probably because it mentioned [NAME] but idk. It's just was a harmless joke lol.
They also almost always miss, leading to that awful thin sheet of bagel that ends up as ash in the oven. 
You can only fit so much in 20ish min show.
Honestly never seen one as dumb as this.
"Isn't that the ""help me, I'm being hunned"" distress signal?"
Not without giving up someone in our top 6 and probably more
Thank you for saying this. It is disrespectful to me. And it hurts.
Thanks, I'm the LAOTOP and I found this response as informative as the comments in the original post.
This is a serious question. Are you glad they told you?
> [NAME] Thanks. The movie is on YT but no subtitles.
[NAME] having an adult life, yeah ist tiring. But not exactly new and not at all women specific imo.
I really can‚Äôt understand why adopting a baby would not be perfect for them. But that might be because I dont have the child-need myself.
Just because you stopped to let me cross doesn't mean the other 3 lanes of cars did.
I appreciate it! I spent a lot of time crafting a story I wanted to tell.
Alright dude just fuck off ok, it's not the funniest thing on the internet but it did make me smile so in conclusion fuck you
I love this. Now I'm craving tacos in the morning.
thats cool to hear ... [NAME] really is laughable in this regard
Recently Retired cop here. I love to see this. This is what he‚Äôs fighting to stop.
Good for you, [NAME]! You deserved a nice drink to end a year where you made an impact in peoples lives! Cheers!
maybe. Id praise her for it though. In a world of... instagram beauty... its refreshing when someone is just themselves
All the time
I'm glad I decided to watch this. Intense, entertaining football with an expert demonstration of how-not-to-use-VAR thrown in for free.
What a legend
yeah. many people mentioned that. also Shield Brah questions beastmen racism .
Convenience.' If that's your view of the issue, not much else to say.
I don't know how accurate that is, pure nicotine is a lot different to nicotine in tobacco so I doubt vaping is that addictive
Wonder which one belongs to [NAME] and what would be his final carbon footprint tally for this trip alone.
Sweet. I can get by on beer. Cant sit through a comedy show without an adult beverage of some kind.
From my point of view the freefolk are evil
Some call sharks the dogs of the sea.
But the seriousness makes it funnier. YES HELLO 311? SOMEONE IS WRONG ON THE INTERNET.
And then, in private, what do you think they jerk off to? Normal porn? Lmao.
They know a lot of people aren't paying attention to the quieter news that doesn't get sensationalized
Oh sorry, I'll do that.
Are you joking??????
He does not want to hear the plans that will work though.
Those are some nice guns
if we follow this pannel she is non existent and you are just allucinating, im sorry to bring the sad news 
You couldn't even figure those out? Wow. Speechless.
Like any relationship... Communication is key üîë Oh yeah Please just be yourself 
They 'let themselves go' because they have to pick up the slack of their husband in the household and don't have time for gym/healthy meal planning anymore.
I also always wear a condom with straight guys. Who knows where they‚Äôve been...
"""aaaand it's intercepted! [NAME] at the goal line!"" music to my ears"
Yep that helps. I‚Äôm in a sneakarchy for sure. Thanks for the info!
Wouldn't your definition of a person apply to all mammals?
"Be careful mentioning the word ""dio"" on the internet."
What do you mean?
Even if it does and they win a tourney [NAME] is gone after this year LOL
Teams got some fire tonight. I like it.
I never thought this fatality fit him, unlike [NAME] or [NAME].
Bran flakes is your friend. Low in calories, and best ‚Äòmotivator‚Äô to use the toilet
I didn‚Äôt realise it
I'd imagine it's heavily dependent on exactly where in the world you are.
Win the information war, freedom fighter.
Socially it's completely unacceptable to pee your pants.
I will admit I see why some people could hate him, but each to their own. 
Great person, tough as hell, will truly be missedüò¢
Man I'm glad that the caption told me this was hilarious... I might not have know otherwise.
Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018.
Oh, the Custom is a great guitar. But it doesn't have same snarl of the Epi.
No, it makes it better.
I saw that [NAME] page was already updated with head coach of AZ as well.
Fasting is for [NAME]! Go on a hunger strike!
Unfortunately 22tcm is not standardized, as long as it's Armscor exclusive it's irrelevant.
hope they had fun in the snow!
Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
I'm so sorry. Hang in there.
Heyyy that's the chair i'm sitting in right now at my home office!
Sounds good ya I'll have to listen to those. Thanks
Yes, I realize that. All my other relationships have been a year or longer but even a month into those I was miserable 
the idea is bad dude. that's the problem.
I'm more than sure we [NAME] lovers feel the same way, her outfits are awful
> It's almost like people are people I've been saying this a lot lately.
If he isn't respecting your clear boundaries then you should block him and move on with your life. He's not worth your time.
Who would win: The Green Arrow or 1 Electric Boi
I've seen her somewhere before
Why thank you sir!
I was right next to that score, bad times so it was.
That was a very well put together video, entertaining and informative. [NAME] is a national treasure.
Such a good one
I'm not counting on them getting elected. I'm counting on them putting enough pressure on the Conservatives to actually become at least a little conservative.
That is a face i do not want to wake up to in the morning
Hope this scenario changes for the better. Else non affiliated scholars might overtake the academia in ushering real breakthroughs that would change the game.
That sounds awful. Glad its from 4Chan, so I know its fake.
Imagine what could've happened if you saw the longer director's cut!
They did the Unreal Engine store in the same way. I'm not surprised.
Yup put the losion in the basket
He's 34 years old.
>the decades after WWII That includes 1950. If you want to insult me, read your own fucking post first
Maybe we will see each other over on that thread and everyone can openly mock me. You should submit it!
LOL thats right, your wait for someone to hand everything to you. LOL
You would feel that she's not into it unless you're him as drunk.
You'll be okay. Just remember that none of that was real, and that nobody knows. Been there so many times. Hang in there.
I'm happy to go without but if it's readily available then everyday.
I am glad, and enjoy. It has some pretty cool theological discussions.
This is most excellent news! Also, glad to know he went on to work somewhere like Google.
Yes, I should be- GOOD LORD, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE?
I have pledged myself to truth, I don't remember signing a pledge.
I guess her Bad breath turned him off
Wait a minute-- is this you, [NAME]? Awkward... 
Oh ok got ya lol
Stupid Sexy [NAME]
Hell it was made clear when I was in High School 5 years ago that we aren't playing a game that's ' too violent '
and then everyone clapped.
[NAME] will be livid if he does not get a burger but see [NAME] stuffing his face.
That's hilarious, and a much better way to play doctor than some of the kids I've heard of! :)
I disagree with you, therefore you must be an idiot. K.
So true! My brain always goes to these places when buying a car...
"What's old is dumb ass ""durr both sides"" arguments that require absolutely zero thought to make."
Because nobody in their right mind would ever buy it
Deathly afraid, the undersides of boats too. I can't look if I see them in a picture or movie
Yo you guys look like the couple from that Episode advertisement
Low sex drive is not uncommon, but one must make sure that one never marry someone with low sex drive if sex drive is important to you. 
Thank you.
I'm surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet...
...oh absolutely! ...it's really bad if they're having a mania episode...
Thanks boss. Finally got a sibling for the Glock!
Venetian Snares x [NAME]. Amazing
Wouldn‚Äôt have looked as cool.
Well this has been interesting
almost [NAME] can do it !!
Not saying it's bad. It just initially looked like the kinda thing you use in resection to stuff
That has no bearing whatsoever on [NAME] fitness for office.
Women don't get an ego boost from and don't enjoy sex with men they're ambivalent about.
Why are you okay with racism and why are slurs the red line?
That is absurd, man. I'm sorry you don't believe in the spirit realm. 
Cut this out .. ALLEN or bust
Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. I feel better already :)
He said sexist not sexiest.
I friggin love [NAME]. Are we sure she aint [NAME] in disguise?
That was twenty years ago now though.
Happy cake day mothafucka
I wanted Dallas to win today so they could lose next week. I don‚Äôt want LA anywhere near the Super Bowl.
That kid checking to see if he was still wearing a helmet made me laugh.
i‚Äôm so sorry.....
[NAME] is pretty dry but he's great for down to the facts videos, I love his voice.
Absolutely. It's exhausting.
I would spend money on hots again for this skin !
North Wahroonga. Lovely clear day, then some distant rumblings, 10 mins later pea-sized hail. Summer <3
Saves me going out to buy toilet paper today
I live next door to this, and I was up late.... How did I not hear this?
Buff *Nurse*??? Lol, this has to be some god-tier shitpost or something
Live about 2 mins from there. Love the view of Waramaug from Tanner Hill.
LOL! You're fucked.
I‚Äôm here for a final set match TB like this match deserves!
Yeah he stacked up some snow which is why he was laughing when the ref went to the bench
Fear of awkward and inconvenient encounters. What can he do to you?
Living is exhausting.
In an unfunny situation you made me laugh, so thanks üòÖ
It was righteous
The thought of shooting anything at asylum seekers is appalling.
They probably died anyways
I think some people don't understand that they don't do him any favor by putting too high expectations on him.
im so sorry you had to go trougth that. it's a shame people are so stupid to deny someone the attention they need becouse their gender.
There‚Äôs still time mate - be careful!
That sounds terrible, man. Have you been to a doctor yet?
‚ÄúWTF, He helped me? ...I‚Äôll eat him last :)‚Äù
A related book for the more nerdy types is [NAME] Burnout Society. Thanks for the share, it was well worth the long read.
Funny thing is he kind of said just that jokingly in the [NAME] interview yesterday
Nah man, there's still no worse feeling in the game than getting frozen by [NAME]. 
Well shit, time to talk to the wife. It appears she has two husbands.
SAF is also in the list for Facebook. I triggered some people when I set my birthday fundraiser up.
Refreshmentos! What's that? It's new!
‚ÄúAttack on masculinity‚Äù I‚Äôm dying over here you fragile motherfucker.
[NAME] says hello! We‚Äôre at version 2.0 now!
You met her in Tinder.... enough said bro....
It's nice for him to take time out of getting angry at people to lecture everyone.
BHARLIE HEAT VERSION
Thank you.
I‚Äôm proud of you for moving out You deserve peace and happiness! Independence is the sweetest thing.
These people project so much, I'm surprised they don't work at cinemas.
Understandable. Thank you for your opinion. Ill move towards due action soon.
But that seems to be the extent of what friends ive ever been able to make
> If you have a point - make it. I did, I'm sorry you missed it.
I can't wait for this capslock variation thing to die out.
That sounds like a good system.
So they should be ecophiles instead, not ecosexuals. 
They hated [NAME] since the beginning of [RELIGION], they treated them like animals
I got a weird vibe when he was placed on Colliton's staff, so I'm really glad it's turned out the way it did. 
I‚Äôm very sorry for the loss of your friend.
I bring great shame on my family with my poops. If only I had the will of dear god emperor [NAME] to halt my poops indefinitely like is able.
maybe now it'll go up to 3 an hourüòé
22s. Good save. Doing [NAME] work.
This is amazing thank u so much u saved my life
And you wonder why Labour get's a bad name for anti-Semitism with statements like that. Ok hun.
I don‚Äôt even go through a period and I‚Äôm still crippled by random cramps

I *couldn't.*
I wish for world peace!
Hahaha, that's brilliant. Stupid and hilarious. 
I don‚Äôt think anyone would be offended by calling a group guys. But idk
That was my first live Lions game (British and flights to DTW are expensive) I've never gone through so emotions in such a short amount of time
Problem is we don't have much else of value. [NAME], [NAME], [NAME]. We have to hope [NAME] likes THJ.
‚ÄúStart caring about Reddit downvotes‚Äù has to be the weirdest life advice I‚Äôve received in years.

Glad that [NAME] continues to be himself even in a mystery fortress. I doubt I'll ever play another game as good.
Love in a way is a choice. In a relationship, you choose to look past your partner's faults
love that, we need more women like you 
That mantra got me through my first 5 years!
Thanks for sharing this tool, gonna be useful in finding fat right subs to tag with reddit pro tools.

AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!!!

"Well, you *are* ""Doing something else"""
Saw thundamentals live. happy that this song got in top 30
I am. I will read those threads as soon as I find some time. But I have got some great insight on this threat regardless.
Not what this sub is for and this doesn't make you look like a good person but ok
This look is fab you can't call everything cringe just because it's eureka
You may be harder on yourself than necessary. Keep praying and confessing your sins. No one is perfect

If he's telling the truth, he wont' get fired for this. Because he's too essential.
It's never going to end unless you end it .
As per, they‚Äôre being slammed on social media. Their response and justification of it being from seven years ago is contrary and lame.
No. People just realized how dogs make good companions and the dogs in the US aren‚Äôt infested with various diseases compared to the ones in developing countries
Thank you so much for saying all this, it needs to be heard more often. 
If they keep the registration costs the same, one less plate to make adds up. 
I'd put the Thielen TD against Packers as number 1. That was such an amazing play by [NAME] and [NAME].
Why would the family talk about this on camera?
I'm so sorry for your losses. Please see a therapist and consider seeing your physician for antidepressant medication. Your daughter will need you alive someday.
Why are you nervous about getting fired if you aren‚Äôt doing anything wrong? If I were an employer firing an employee would be my last resort.
Lost his legs, what an idiot.
Anytime someone says ‚ÄúSorry, English is my second language,‚Äù I already know I‚Äôm in for a well written post.

I do! I buy 5-blade Dorcos. I'll never go back to razors marketed to women.
Dear [NAME]....
Agreed. But considering their poor cars were carrying 1200+ lbs of weight, that might slow things down lol
This guy is one of the best role models for [NAME]
No. You seem to still be completely misunderstanding what memory conformity is. Are you familiar with the process as documented in the peer-reviewed literature?
I do have harnesses for them ... maybe I‚Äôll makeshift a sled and see what happens!
I do but I like my job. I just hate the fact I HAVE to go do it.
This game is actually worse than I was anticipating and I knew it was gonna be bad
They're all concerned about keeping the human race going. As for reproduction stopping with us, let it be.
I mean Darkfall really has the best combat but the rest of the game lacks.
Your welcome. A simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù would‚Äôve sufficed. Didn‚Äôt need the long-winded response. r/ChoosingBeggars
Intrusive thoughts happen in anxiety disorders, although I'm not sure if that's what you're describing here
Thanks for pointing out the only error I made. Out of everything there, that is what you chose to take issue with.
lol [NAME] would definitely do this if [NAME] was that dumb to take this offer.
I think that‚Äôs what she expects too.
It won't make them worse off. GDP is simply irrelevant. Rent and job conditions are what matters.
*snerk* People like this kill me. Idiots.
It sure smells and feels nice. I also don‚Äôt find my hands as dry as usual compared to bar soap.
I agree, Thats also how I felt when I visited Japan last year
What a nutbar lol
Thank you for sharing, there are many abusive relationships out there and it's not always so easy to leave 
I love this cross-over
But it keeps my head warm.

"be careful of the island guy, he is sweet but he can be a lion too"""
That dress is made with industrial strength lycra/polyester and thread. I'm amazed it didn't blow up and kill innocent bystanders at the restaurant.
Men find that attractive because it's distinctly feminine. Well, let me add, women who love women love it for the same reason. 
Stop attacking me.
I became a member in the summer and have still not gotten my packet, your post just gave me hope it still might come
Hated her. And that was honestly a more offensive reaction than everyone laughing at her IMHO
Went to school with her son. She is larger than life in person. Always swaying gracefully. It was crazy.

Sending you warm wishes :) <3
They just dont want to go to school. Source:am high schooler who would skip school at any chance given
Can't say that I do, no.
I would love a gatling gun arm like Barret from FF7 has.
I don't get it. Are they upset that men aren't all using the blue nametags because blue is the color for boys, or what?
When the caterer found out [NAME] was going to pay the bill out of his own pocket, perhaps they declined the honour.
right. cause it's real. that's why she has to talk about it.

I've only seen a handful of episodes, but we're supposed to believe that the FBI agent is so incompetent that he never finds out?
I love this because she doesn't even start out well and end poorly- it was bad the whole way through.
I think he can be much, much better than [NAME]. No doubt. His length, good defense. We are talking about [NAME], right?
Where the fuck is that Kepner rocks person when we need them the most.
He has been horrible in pull up situations but not horrible with catch and shoot this season.
But if you connect to the Internet, then you don't need no stinking procedures!(end bad spanish accent).
Easily one of the Top 5 Best Interviews ever
"Go look at the top posts of those subs. How far do you have to scroll to get to a ""men are trash"" post?"
Maybe it's better to start telling the truth and start actually being a father.
Dude couldn‚Äôt see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?!
I've had such bad memories, I remember when I remember bad times now! Haha
Now everyone is going to know that you didn't waste your time scrolling through tumblr looking for funny blogs to screenshot!
At some angles you can get a ws4 into a combo but its inconsistent.
It's a gift.
Women are nice. Except when they murder you.
I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
And you believe this?

If he moved on, it‚Äôs time you do too. Plain and simple... your 15 years old... lots of time to find someone new.

More Nice Guy IMO.
Lip injections only cost $700 and I saved up for months. But I‚Äôm broke currently

I thought so too, glad I asked.
So funny, I just watched this one today and was struck by [NAME] in the height of his coked out glory. He is absolutely so gross. 
Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!

Neon carrot is amazing and great for your body.
Not censoring usernames is against Reddit‚Äôs rules...
Let's not kid ourselves; most of us [NAME] are like that.
I assumed that came from him brandishing a firearm at the kids after they egged his car.
Boy, she really does live rent free in your heads. At least conservative head rent is cheaper than D. C. rent. 
So you have your twin 6'9 215 pound forwards playing different positions? Interesting gm'ing. I see why the Hornets are so terrible.
Just like that great historical fact about the [NAME] head being used to mark abused women's shelters in ancient Greece!
Not enough time in the day I have a lot of games I haven‚Äôt played in awhile I wanna play again
> Do you need me to link posts or something? Yep. Nice ban evasion account, by the way. 
It's kinda odd that people are downvoting you without providing well-sourced counter-arguments to the points you're making.
I don't have a smart phone; however, I wouldn't need one in this case.
Lol looks delicious
Thanks, but I am most certainly broken.
Unfortunately if you‚Äôre looking for game info about the Detroit Basketball team your in the wrong sub.
There just shouldn't be police enforcing nonsense traffic laws. Cops should stay at their station until summoned by a citizen like fire trucks and ambulances do.
[NAME] said that it was recorded the monday after [NAME], that's why his voice is like that.
"Also because someone could then be either ""An Asexual"" or ""A Sexual"", and that would be confusing out loud. "
I would love that. [NAME] and [NAME] were easily my favourite supporting characters of season 2
Yeah, still the wrong strain to even remotely dive into CBD therapy (<0.7, yikes)... but I understand your point.
Twas a joke ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lmao, I really messed this up. Loved your replies in the og thread, mate, keep up the good work :). 
They won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre just going to ignore it because fortnite makes them money.
I love the creative writing that stems from this sub, so entertaining.
Sounds like a great idea that your nephew is moving away from her. She‚Äôd be an absolutely toxic mother.
You still sit when you piss.
Makes sense, but I imagine if they wanted the land that badly theyd just buy it off him
We had a long debate about how old Jackie bird is and as per every year were surprised by the result. Was pish
I'm not responding until you point me where any of my statements contradict cut and clear
Yikes. Was he unfamiliar with the area? How did it go over at work?
"Ugh YES. I literally am so against it and everyone is always like ""why it's fun"" but like I just want to find love "
You know what‚Äôs ignorant? People who spend their free time making themselves look like a belligerent, disputatious assholes. Find something better to do. 
I thought it went well, but then she clearly didn't I guess it started to go downhill the second she saw my face C'est la vie I suppose.
Alright thanks to all. I will tr it with more wards the next time and boots and penetration. Thx for your support!
I don't wish abortions on any woman. It's a terrible thing to endure. Necessary, sure, but it's still grim.
I don‚Äôt know how to link but if you search within this page there was a whole thread on it
Do you shut the door and allow them to stay there or do you leave it open?
Someone you guys are on Grindr just to screenshot your own witty replies to men trying to bang you, don‚Äôt deny it.

If you take that line, any excess money you have is immoral. Tough line to tow.
Yeah I can understand there their confusion more but yeah. Reminds me of [NAME] haha.
She's a good chief stew and very good at her JOB but a shitty people person and a shitty leader.
Yo infected turn into evil clone troopers !!!
We just had a teacher do that at my school. I don't know who wiped the kids butts though
Had no idea Belgrade was suffering so
Doesn't answer the question about who is going to pick the low hanging fruit though!
You‚Äôre not going to win, so you have nothing to worry about. 
The players turning on him for crying story cracked me up though.
[NAME] is Asian. She is also white. She has talked before about how she does not like people to erase either half of her.
Yeah, she's reasonable on some issues for sure, but the problem is that there isn't more like her
[NAME] way of doing things is straight trash for [NAME] lol. The latter end of the competition being bottom is a default sometimes.
Fuck is exactly what she's good for
You are neither.
Probably overdose in a hotel after losing my virginity to an escort on my 30th birthday
Morals aren't tied to religiosity, nor the absence of it.

You‚Äôre an animal, and you deserve all the shame/repercussions you get.
[NAME] I wish that were me.
They are so damn handsome!
Or he just tired of her and this cute chick just slid into the DM just in time
"It saddens me that [NAME] legacy has become ""Posterboy for edgy manchilds"""

Eh. I say it's accurate.
What the fuck who likes cold
I have zero faith in the electoral college/ tge sham that is our right to vote
One of the rare times I actually laugh out loud while browsing online.
Whatever you do, respect the kids' genders.
Its an mlm in disguise, branded to appeal to the college demographic. I got the fuck out 
I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
I hope not, i was just sharing what happened to my bud. GL man, hope you get it figured out
[NAME] eyebrows look terrible. That‚Äôs really my only takeaway from this picture.
A thousand year old institution that is hundreds of years old and has remained largely unchanged for almost a decade.
I still don't get what the joke was supposed to be
Im turning 30 this year. We just cant get rowdy like we used to man, i mean we *can* but damn all these responsibilities
Reddit hates women.
"Is it weird that my first thought was ""at least it's not a Minion?"" "
I've heard of alligator boots, but I always thought that meant something else.

Interesting, thanks!
I like that [NAME] is still [NAME]
Oh sorry dude, I was just looking for the WiFi password. [NAME], but I hope you stay safe
You better go to a church tomorrow and repent..also, tell the Pastor what happened. I am serious. 
Damn Replays was pretty solid last year. But maybe he should go back to coaching.
This post made me howl in laughter in the handicapped bathroom, thank you /u/coffeewhore17
Easy, killer. I don't think Solo itself is a goofy name as OP implies. I think it was just a dumb point in the movie. 
>The young will never trust them. Ever. You hope.
I thought this was going to be a fierce, competitive game... how wrong I was.
I think it‚Äôs one of these softballs
Great, about to rewrite my many ToDo lists
You beat me to this joke.
Well, I don't agree, but I do appreciate having a real discussion rather than just name calling lol. Agree to disagree

Weirdly enough that's my favorite part of his videos: the ending sting/title card It reminds me of old school racing and fighting games with those over-the-top announcers
Is anyone forced to work in prison?
I guess I'm confused why beliefs are not voluntary. The link talks about conclusions based on that but doesn't seem to address the premise.
Is that what happens is [NAME] route? I chose [NAME] and he only does once.
Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here.
LOL. Glad you noticed.
Wow what a final quarter. [NAME] throwing two intersepts. What a dog
LOL I think I'm the opposite, once I rehearse in my head, I mess up completely; I'm way better at improvising. 
That makes no sense. You know that right?
Thank you once again! I'm officially out of question now lol Happy New Year!
[NAME] black?
I bet you‚Äôre really fun at parties.
Go take a shower your personality stinks
Yes! It's hard to believe that some people like warm toilet seats enough to pay for it as a feature.
I think some idiotic members are extremist, but for the most part they just hate mass unchecked immigration.
Great work hentaipoon!
I rarely get full manic. Lithium just took away my mixed irritable angry episodes and I'm pretty sure those aren't superpowers lol
She's just going to suck you back in.
That's such a lazy way of looking at things.

Jobby is a new one for me, is that another way of saying taking a crap?

Awesome. Thank you so much!

You‚Äôre a genius.

The absolute subhuman filth that worships [NAME] will believe that this isn't even a photoshop
"At least you didn't open with, ""I was always a big [NAME] supporter..."" 99% of those go downhill fast."
Your dad is a wise man
The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
I had corrected myself but I deleted the original post now for people like yourself who don‚Äôt read fully before you get enraged and comment.
Man I am so happy for [NAME], they are selling out. Personally there is no way I would be able to afford them for 38$
I'm curious, what you mean? 
You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election.
Probably right, I could have mixed up the years or just misremembering
Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
Lies, damn lies and statistics.

There is a bud superhighway called Interstate 80 that connects PA to CO.
No? This is literally saying that a wall would be useless, unless you also wanna build 40-50 feet beneath the ground.
Yep. There are some good things hidden in amongst the bad. It would be disingenuous to claim otherwise.
Freedom? Not in New 2013 and it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse since
Fond memories of one guy having a tub of ice cream for dinner!
‚ÄúGo for the sodas and ice cream‚Äù would be sufficient. No need to rag on the food.
Nope. This is shown with [NAME] spider-man having reversed version of the Raimiverse spider-man, a la the upside down kiss having [NAME] on the bottom instead.
[NAME] is bad & anyone who still supports him should feel bad for it.
I am an immigrant myself, how ignorant of you. 
I guess you could say that it was unexpected
There's no infiltration. [NAME] is their friend. Have been for many years.

Hers are just terrible. I‚Äôve seen the look great on other people.
They're living their fantasy.
My 4 month old just got her second round of shots, so yeah, we feel you. Hope you're able to get a good rest!!
I agree it seemed very odd the whole live stream...
Wow that was ...mind blowing.
A reminder that >![NAME]!< unironically likes the Emoji Movie.
Deflections don't help your cause.
-no scary creatures trying to kill you- Ha! You haven't heard of Rhode Islanders yet! /s
Do something about what?
The problem is I have no clue where he stands as he‚Äôs so far on her side.
I can't tell you how happy I am that [NAME] and [NAME] are Polynesian Sauce guys.
I feel like she‚Äôd be more than half-way there if she just fixed those eyebrows...
I mean, let's not pretend [NAME] wouldn't be screaming murder if this happened at Spa instead of NVA
Despite having lived here for 10 years, i've never been to portillos, and given this, it's somewhat unlikely i start going now...
Nah I wish, that would have been awesome!!
I get a kink in my neck from brushing my hair damn
Uh well one has a long face but I think we‚Äôre thinking of different people here haha. They‚Äôre a popular 80‚Äôs band

[NAME], it's like nobody learned a single thing from the game.
Hey he's not the one running [NAME] Twitter account can't blame him for that.
If you think people in this sub are gonna get butt-hurt you are in for a pleasant surprise.
Somers is full of bougie rich people and Mansfield is all college kids.
The pool is closed.
You just gotta man up, go out there, and get that kiss.
üòÇ sometimes I love old people. Not always. But sometimes! I ant wait to be an old ass troll saying shit like this.
I love how everyone is standing, and then [NAME] and [NAME] are leaning over.
I did this with tuna salad. I already ate tuna a lot (at the time) and it‚Äôs a decently blank slate.
How right you are.
Now, could you please turn the card around and show me those wacky three numbers on the back. 
They look like rappers
My hands are tired from typing ‚Äúand everyone clapped‚Äù. That kid‚Äôs name though? [NAME]!
There is a startling lack of empathy in this thread.
It just has to be clean and hygienic. Maybe make sure you got food and wine on deck
Yow thats gnarly.
Love [NAME] more.
Whoops! My mistake
Gotta get up by 2 so you can be up by 5
Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.
I liked it...
Neither are sleeping adults, so it's ok to kill someone as long as they are asleep.
love that the block against AZ is in this. what a year for Kittle.
My grandmother does that.
Someone just vandalized this poor guys car in the target parking lot lol
Honestly, these are probably things you should have thought about before telling your husband you wanted to separate. 
Just the CW thread, I don't think I've noticed bias outside of it.
You can do it! live the dream!
Yeah he could have stopped talking, but they didn't have to but his tongue out. they are the ones at fault for actually cutting his tongue out
22 hours and emailed support an hour ago, no answer yet. Will update here on progress.

OP inserted the F into ‚Äúof‚Äù to make ‚Äúoff‚Äù and now it‚Äôs truly upsetting.
Yea I‚Äôm into this I guess. So thanks for that(?)
Wasn't hurtful at all. It felt comforting to me reading it. We're all good.
She looks like snooki bro
Your wife is smart.
Why are you trying to cheat NJ transit? NJ transit is in deep financial debt and you are trying to steal from them. Shame.
It‚Äôs a cruel thing to say to someone with depression.
I think the popularity of Alliance confirms my point about radical centrism on here
I'm so happy for you and so, so, so proud of you. It's HARD to talk to your doctor about this stuff.
I feel like you almost have to or else some regulars will try to pull a fast one thinking your a green bean.
Shut up, why you so stupid!? I'm just kidding
He's so far into his fantasy land he can't let anyone say a fact to his face, it would destroy his dreams. Poor little snowflake u/chabanais 
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes dude.
It's a loooong story with some awkward weirdness haha

It hurts to look at it
> Democracy doesn't seem like such a great idea Here's your honorary trip to China
I thought [NAME] trained her after the boxing was over?
Chasing thoughts and storing tension in your hands is how you distract yourself from feeling social tension and empathy. You need to allow yourself to feel these feelings.
I think the unluckiest... is [NAME]. :(
We got nowhere with that because you only drop one-liners and refuse to actually engage.
You need to make sure that healthy food is within convenience for the players so that they don‚Äôt end up eating 2 minute noodles every day

Love it when the wife goes lets it go retro. Also love it when she gets that puppy waxed.
tf, didnt know that thx
Thank god, Montrose has always been lacking some decent Mexican food and now we're finally getting it!

Walmart is a special kind of hell.
Damn youtube and outrage drama is super lucrative for reddit

OK, I think I can binge and rebinge the entire run 20 or 30 more times before then, PHEW!
[NAME] is an arrogant schmuk but he‚Äôs good at what he does.
I mean your brain isn't fully developed, especially the decision making skills until between 20-25. I forget the exact age. 
This is very accurately funny and sad. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I know and I think that's a lot more impressive/interesting. :)
It is a great line though!
Idk how to do that on my phone :/
Man, half the time they show me a google search that had no target results.
I take it they don‚Äôt train high risk traffic stops in Arkansas?
With those pieces I‚Äôd be surprised üòí
I'm the same. I prefer sad depressed dudes and idk why. I know I like taking care of people though..
It'll soon be loved, it's under control! 
I hate that I like them...
Woke is realizing the world doesnt revolve around you at its most basic level. Thats dumb?
Who would have guessed Libertine Gold and Black posters would be coke heads?
What does scalp mean?
I'm really appreciate someone saying this.
Unfortunately you can‚Äôt control YouTube. It‚Äôs pretty bad out there, you just have to finish the episode ASAP. 
Oh, haha Gladstone is a town in North Qld Australia as well... thanks Reddit
Thank I may just try to find halal store and buy snacks that are popular . I heard even marshmallow may not comply.
Remember the year ‚ÄúSong 2‚Äù was number 2? Good times.
Hitting me. That just added another funny dynamic to it even though I wasn‚Äôt actually trying to hit her.
Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we‚Äôll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...
I never thought about that last part - how cool! He is lucky to have you for an owner, you seem very caring!
Looks like he deleted it. Can‚Äôt find it on his profile history
Ride in trunk
[NAME] engagement photo shoot This is the best she has ever looked in my opinion. HAWT!
According to roadcam, everyone stops that far past the stop line and if you say you don't, you're a liar.
Sweet, I've put that as location and took a note of that route. You fancy it?
calling someone desperate for a comment is a personal attack. sure jan
Something tells me she just got it too.
Protests that don't disturb the status quo are ignorable.
He has become that which he swore to destroy!
That sound you are hearing is me, a middle aged woman, applauding you wildly. How fun this is to read on my morning break.
Cats/dogs for sure. It would be refreshing.
If she said looks arent your problem, she wants to have sex with you, I learned that in r/niceguys 101
Okay but how about someone who doesn‚Äôt believe the Wifi signals are going to kill us?
Do I come across as thin-skinned? Hm, never noticed. Maybe it's an allergic reaction to dishonesty.
Glad to see Hearts fans giving [NAME] such a warm welcome back..
Oops. I assumed, wrongly, that it was the same person.
Agreed, that‚Äôs different if it‚Äôs their choice, but I would suggest against starting off that way!
Great. How about go fuck yourself moron, I‚Äôm making a great suggestion for a good reason despite you bitches.
I like it
Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.
And they are right. [NAME] ([NAME]) even shot the ball and missed after [NAME] made shot
Okay this meme is getting old now.
Not a single comment from a journo about [NAME] has now successfully integrated RLC.
Moms name is Salad. They call her 'suh-LAD' so she can feel included.
Thank you very much for the advice I didn't really have anywhere else to turn
"Thank you for the tip. I've added it to my ""to read"" list."
I guess I've never seen that written out. Thanks for the correction.
What was the drama in Dallas? I didn't hear.
Because men are weak/stupid enough to let them.

One of the greatest moments of my life, to date
For I am here with youuuuu
He forgot the most important law : Everyone can be stupid, and everyone will be at some point. Although he does illustrate it very well with his article.
Less expensive than chain-link. Needs warning signs, though, and be within his property line.
Some Leftist ideologies frown upon SocDems as counterrevolutionary. Don‚Äôt agree with it, but that‚Äôs the thought process.
I hope you managed to skunk him, so he caught an aroma every time he moved. 
And desks clapped
I think this is next on our list, thanks!
Wait, wait, wait. Wait. You're talking about him not being as much into cybersex as you? Actual sex you have similar sex drives? 
Anything in this sub that reaches front page is. I'm subscribed for the sake of genuinely funny content.

I took it as a woke/edgy joke. Don't admit it was just a typo!!!
I can't wait to see what us skilled workers get. Thanks government for telling businesses how to run and wrangle unskilled workers with no ambition.
I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.
Wat u been ordering u naughty boyüòÇ
Especially the jellies, they come up so fast!
You become assertive and take back your share of the power and control over your life. Go get No More Mr. Nice Guy.

...says the opioid addicted narcissist with multiple untreated physical and psychological ailments and is completely unable to work with anyone but his own clone.
This isn't a sport from Holland it's from Frisia, the title is wrong
To show themself in public like that they never did grow up. A 11 year old in a 25 year old body. Sad, really.
Well technically [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] get eliminated again but from the ones still in the competition yes no one goes home
It says Expect. Which means nothing is official as of right now.
DO YOU HAVE YOUR PASSPORT
My nuts hurt watching that second part
Heres some well wishes to you staying up
I don't know what you're talking about, but that sounds just as racist as it is sexist.
I'm hopeful but going in with tempered expectations. There have been some remasters in which I was really disappointed. BioShock comes to mind.
It's hard to have a nuanced opinion, innit? But I don't like everything he does. This is one if them.
The fuck? That ball was still on the ground tho.
That's a cute spider.
That‚Äôs an amazing photo. Thanks for sharing!
[NAME] was the only one I actually liked, besides [NAME].
This is the most perfect thing I've ever seen. So many layers
Burnout takedown. Then when trying to recover in the weekend, a nice chunk of self condemnation.
And that whole [NAME] thing too
How come nobody even reacted?
That's a really cheap cop-out for rather common criticism of those games.
You sound like my brother. I only have one tip. Calm the fuck down. You cant think when youre upset
That would have been a funny had we never made playoffs

Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
It wasn't an intelligent comment to begin with why would I take it seriously? Though I guess those 28 people did.
Im fine with complaining. A little surprised he's complaining without playing or even reading the patch notes since they were released.
I teach the same students and one of them argued that poverty was a choice. It was an...interesting class discussion.
Learning to read was the worst mistake of my life
Hey, nice to be here üòè
Well shit, if all you gorgeous people haven‚Äôt settled down yet, there‚Äôs no hope for me
This qualifies as emotional neglect. Just, to be clear, that is a form of covert abuse and is not okay or normal.
holy shit I got mad at those 4 points you made [NAME], playing [NAME] like that would be literally hell.
They should just give us the cup now and save everyone some time
Yo good for you!
Same. All other map on OG with SSD were fine. [NAME] drops and it's terrible.
Wait so you can do that infinitely, even with placed campfires?
Or just simply hinting at it. All in fun though
I would love to see a sewing challenge with Manila in the mix.
This is a great thread for catching up on my block list. 10/10 would block again

I hate that we cant be trusted to self criticize and we have to have Russian news do it. It feels like watching fox.
That‚Äôs great! Love this sort of thing. Is that really a prison on the north side of vauxhall bridge? Prime real estate now!
I dated a Pens fan from SWB and can confirm this is very much a weird thing.
i did, but it was at 3 am before i went to bed, so i‚Äôm gonna cheat and count it as 2018 LOL.
Super helpful. Thanks!
Remind me! 6 months

SKYRIM!! Hahaha
Sorry, mom took it out of the oven already and I am STARVING!

If it's true i'm sad he's leaving but I wish him nothing but the best.
Bitch right!
Was thinking this would go the route of actually eating the thin guy. Bravo. üëèüëè
A burned hand teaches best, after that advice about fire goes to the heart.
Look I'm not saying that I agree with them, theres no need to be an asshole
Goddamnit [NAME] back at it again...
I just find it very strange that someone would have a child in a relationship where they had felt unloved for years.
As funny as a sinking school bus.
At least if you don't have the body, you've got the sense of humour. So I can rule you out or is it a possibility lol
[NAME] rosenbrook? Is this woman mental. Why does she use these names?
Only time I teabag, my friend was getting moried at the exit gate and I teabagged him before I left
That looks so awesome
Apologies, that distinction always slips my mind lol
I'm hopeful for [NAME] as well!
Easy on the Granville Island gatekeeping amigo. Its absolutely a tourist destination.
Don't worry. You'll grow out of Pearl Jam.
Dunno how the Pistons could pull of any trade and expect value in return that isn't some sort of salary dump from elsewhere.
So is [NAME] the frontrunner for Executive of the Year, pre trade deadline?
I can't miss a chance to post one of my favorite gifs ever! üòÇ
Them boys smelling even more blood in the water. Rack them fuckin points up boys!

Yeah, the gauntlet ruins everything
It's all good. [NAME] was at my door 5 minutes later, and amazingly, didn't drive away between me seeing him, and walking downstairs. 
How do you deal with not having pushers? They‚Äôre literally our saviors in grocery since we never have time to zone over there...
It took me forever to realize it was not in fact [NAME]....
totally agree.
Love the user name ;)
OMG, im on hype.
Sorry man, it‚Äôs gonna be really hard to find a Rose jersey anywhere that isn‚Äôt a 3XL
You are right. There's absolutely no group of liberals here that calls everyone right of [NAME] [NAME] every chance they get.
He had another fight with cancer. I believe he is ok now but chemo is very very nasty.
Doesn't quite have the same ring to it
Props to the guy for being honest

That awkward moment when you fully embrace misogyny but believe homophobia is wrong.
Holy no punctuation, [NAME]! 
"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. "
Lol I have my moments!
I know she's literally only just been revealed, but I *love* the name [NAME]
I'm worried he's too small. I love his quickness, but sub-170 is scary for a guy that'll be running over the middle.
It didn‚Äôt come out. What you say!?
Donteee blowee my coveree lmao I actually like how she talks
Thank you for your service o7
Thanks. Some of the things just require a little tweaking so really I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be too hard.
It didn‚Äôt help [NAME]. He should have invested in a crosscut, it might have been a bigger challenge to put back together
I got bad news for ya'll. I picked Chargers, Colts, Saints, and Cowboys to win. So Eagles might be winning :/ 
I would watch that so hard. But I'm sure what's left of LuLaRoe and other MLMs will do whatever they can to stop it.
That's generally how hacking works; if you knew about it, they'd be terrible hackers.
Oh recently I‚Äôve started working out and concentrating on myself. Has helped improved my mental strength as well as physical. I feel ready for anything.

I can't wait to find out why this is inaccurate and I should hate the person who made this post and shower them with downvotes.
guess nature has it all wrong then, for physical work what he said is undeniably the case.
yet another infuriating loss, against a garbage team no less
Do you think people are generally logical?
You can be partners without being codependant, you can also keep your individuality without worrying or hurting your relationship. Its all about communication.
What a good pupper!
Oh hell yeah. The Don is perfect for when [NAME] rounds into the second half of his career after he‚Äôs collected a few rings.

They didn't get magically transported from another life and retain all their memories and tendencies. So it's not apples to apples.
You can't. It's best you go see a professional about that wound of yours.
I'M MR. [NAME]! HOW DID WE GET ROPED INTO THIS?
This reply made me giggle. Sorry you got hit by a moron! Hope your car is repairable!
But according to [NAME] [NAME] didn‚Äôt use a phone to contact [NAME], right? Also, Oct 5?
She has a point. The water from the runoff channel behind my house tastes way worse than the water from my sink.
Flush the toilet that's a deduction.
i dream of making $7k
Thanks! Itll take some getting used to for sure but I'm excited to move on.

For some reason I'm imagining a hauty, French snorting laugh.
[NAME] has only missed a couple games and WCJ hasn't missed any. Not sure how you rank their top 4.
I loved this costume and wasn‚Äôt even aware of the amount of hate it had until recently
This is legit. Nobody puts baby in a corner! (Or a box)
Just throw them into a pool of needles. That'll teach them not to steal ever again.
The bottom comment: >Passing is the gold standard that determines whether you fit the social role of man or woman. [NAME], how regressive. 
Awesome use of open data. Love the app.
[NAME], looks promising for seasons to come as well
I‚Äôm an anarchist, I don‚Äôt know how to read
Oh and just fyi for everyone, the girls are bisexual (obviously haha) and I am Pansexual, though [NAME] thinks she may be Pansexual too üòÅ

Downvoted because I stated facts ok...

This made me incredibly happy and incredibly sad. Sometimes this universe robs us of the wrong people.
Ngl the entire first order feels like a joke...
Not all [NAME] supporters are tankies, but all tankies are [NAME] supporters
Then present an opposing argument.
You could notice he was a little bit nervous, i think that was the main reason for his way of playing in this game.
How cute, the JV players are fighting

i think people who get up in a dizzy over an add that shames bullying and sexual harassment are probably special snowflakes.
Have you ever, you know, tried not reading something that pisses you off? Just downvote and move on.
Yeah I‚Äôm working with my therapist to help me identify certain behaviors early and pay attention to the red flags.

why are you a detective all of a sudden
She thought the fuel pump was cold and decided to try warming it up. You know, to prevent the gasoline from freezing and causing blockage.
NJ has zero of their own picks from the 2010 draft still in the org
Bro, too close to home. Thing is I wish I could just chill where this monk is at, with a lot of open space.
NCAA is a poor barometer for scoring. [NAME] was leading scorer in all NCAA for like 3 years running. Not even sure he got drafted.
As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you.
[NAME] forbid i love and support and show that support and love for my country apparently im racist now...
I thought it was funny lol. The whole situation was dumb and both sides were in the wrong.

You care more about their actions in that case.
Now you seem like a dumb cunt
Lol just watched this episode
Lol didn't some character mention even the league of assassins was afraid of [NAME]?
How the hell
Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
I second that
Seems very very aggressive. I would love for you to be right.
Thanks. That makes me feel a little less lazy and a little more responsible
Yes, definitely classy. <rolls eyes>
Ok will do, but I listened to the ep right before I posted this.
Because they're all done by the same, really, really old guy
**LET‚ÄôS GO HAWKS!!!**
Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that‚Äôs just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
Chernobyl incident has scared everyone to death about nuclear, I'm curious where we would be if that never occurred.
A nice reminder that no one even considered giving acuna for gray
Sadly, that‚Äôs not the interpretation that many elders in your church have made. See: the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Abuse. :(

Thank you. This is well-written and it‚Äôs really helpful.
This very thing got me diagnosed as ADD. I'm of the drugs now and feeling way much better.

You're very welcome. You do, and I hope (for your sake and especially for your daughters') that things work out for you all.
Man, what a fool. All you gotta do is if(on_earth) fireRocket(); I'll be taking my 7 figure salary now.
Neither is beating people up
This, and its about to (already has, reallly) start happening to [NAME].
I‚Äôm seeing a doctor tomorrow. Thanks for caring
How dare they ask me to be a good person! I'll show em!
A supposedly professional article banging on about gammons and insulting people's appearance. Not an impressive display of journalism, just a pathetic blog designed to preach to the choir.
Why does [NAME] also steal [NAME] revolutionism
There‚Äôs NO WAY that car is worth 25k - walk away.
It's okay; his father's a lawyer. They're going to own that batting cage in three months. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?!

Yes! I used to do this all the time actually, especially go to the mall alone. It was actually really nice.

Thank [NAME] for the adult spammers on my susbscribed NSFW subreddits.
Oh man, I love [NAME]. She's so consistently good. 
lmao i wish it was 10 am for us in south america
After watching TLJ, I find it impossible to watch TFA. It's a sequel to some film, but that film is not TFA.

I'm sorry to hear. I wish you the best of luck with everything! Just know that we're all here for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
They feel soooo good on TBF
Oh damn I'm a clemson student I swore I had a flair on here
The books are pretty cool. They even get into the nerdier science side of being able to teleport.
Guy or girl?
Aaaaand sold out.
I think it's pretty obvious given the significance of how relabeling sugars has been handled.
An RPG could have solved this problem.
No thank you, I'm just here to use your bathroom
Hahaha I know this one, thank you SORTED boys!
Whhhattttt. That‚Äôs crazy!!!
I can't read Korean. Out of curiosity, what are the others?
That's funny stuff, there
Nah, it's still funny. I think it would be less funny if it was my country tho 
You must be new to character ranking threads if you think I'm *genuinely* upset at some random person's worthless opinions.
It turns out he works for [NAME], so maybe your instinctive distrust might not have been the worst first reaction.
Probably not, and I'm fine with that. Not exactly the position nor type of person a rebuilding team needs. 
It‚Äôs halftime so I turned it on LivePD and this is the first thing I see...
TAMAR ESPECIALLY!!!
Not a fan of [NAME] but [NAME] I hope [NAME] gets knocked out here
And now the tolerant left is downvoting our comments because they don‚Äôt agree with another equally valid point of view.
That would look enormous if [NAME] ordered it!
Lmao the UBI is just the powers that be making sure they don't have a revolt on their hands once their program of economic alienation reaches a head.
oh yes, we are.
there is a whole youtube channel about this issue in russia just search for STOP HAM
Signed up! This is brilliant!
Ballarat so we don‚Äôt lose the [NAME] bros.
Sorry, can you translate that to English for me?
I feel the r/thathappened for more than half of the stories posted. But they're fun to read.
You're amazing. I'd buy it :)

Thanks for the explanation! And lol yeah that‚Äôs fair - ‚Äòrag‚Äô isn‚Äôt exactly the flashiest of terms!
This is my favorite picture in this sub
Also not true. Germany had pervasive antisemetism long before [NAME]. Ignoring that error your argument is horrible and you should be ashamed.
Burn through ALL THE DATA
I think I like em even more lol
Your wife's behavior is inconsistent with continuing your marriage to her.
And she said this after [NAME] got naked in her hallway!
on the bright side he‚Äôs a little too young to ruin a $1000 iphone in his pocket ( parents probably got him a refurbished 7 )
At this point I am questioning your sanity, you compare a guy with 40/34 goal seasons to a kid who literally can't hit the net
As much as I'd love to say it's mine, sadly I can't
Your baby is adorable. I can‚Äôt even deal with the cuteness üòÇüòÇüòÇ
As much as I like [NAME] and want him to score so many (hes a speedy mofo) I think that this would be a good trade for sure
Now think about the point I was trying to make. It wasn't that I talk to servers and ask them if they like tipping more
Im a Florida you racist
as long as they remain indoor cats, no problem with being a cat lady. you do you 
Can I stop seeing this on every sub please
>cumpoo Now wait a minute..
GOOD [NAME] ALIGHTY, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF
What a (morbid) analogy - I like it!
I can't post on r/dankmemes :(
Thanks for the review, comments, etcetera.
Of course he‚Äôs doing it to get laughs, because when you dumb something down enough it appeals to more people.
That‚Äôs exactly how mine is ! Wow that‚Äôs sort of funny there is an actual name For it üò≥üòî
Maybe we‚Äôve been mishearing the word ‚Äòstarch‚Äô as ‚Äòstaunch‚Äô

I mean‚Ä¶ yeah? So glad to be at that age where the conversation would be more uncomfortable for them than for me.

Nah you‚Äôre good. I‚Äôd rather date someone who never married/never had kids than the opposite.
He's been cheered for years now.
Hahaha good point!
>[NAME] well, there's your problem
Surly [NAME] always puts a smile on my face.
"There are far better thinkers. As one critic put it, ""[NAME] either says something new but not true or true but not new."" "
My dosage was increased 2 weeks ago and I've noticed the issues getting worse. With your comment, I'm really leaning towards them being side effects.
I mean I'd rather have play him in the infield, but either way someone will get injured and [NAME] will play the infield.
Now you go get his armor and do the same thing.
Is this in response to something that you've noticed about or just a general statement?
Technology bad!
I had a big omnibus edition. It was great, but a good 4-5 inches thick!
Fuck you bro
[NAME] save us
Why cinnamon powder instead of bark?
Dirt bar downtown is pretty sweet.
Thanks dude.
[NAME] and destroying the OKC thunder name a more iconic duo
That's still doxing.

It's going to hit all of us but there it is : no deal. It's high time to accept reality.
There's also Miami (India) and Liberia (USA).
Oh I know. I will never forget either of those scenes, poor kid.
The problem is that rent controls and the prevention of urban infrastructure expansion is killing city renters. Which is what most cities do.
There is irony in what you guys are saying.

You are valued and appreciated
No probs. I'm going to see if some of the smaller communities can add it as a resource to their tabs
Sadly, it was not
It still seems dangerous
Definitely better than mine lol. Some good players on there.
Oh [NAME]. So it looks like a head shot with a 50 cal.

"Yeah I was waiting for him to coming at the end with ""Why don't you just let us do it?"" I would."
You're right. I read that tweet and I think it dislodged from my brain because it just assumed nobody would argue something that utterly stupid.
Brave would be the movie you‚Äôre looking for

Buddy. Your prejudice is showing. Also plot twist I'm a white [NAME] woman. You don't understand the principle of what white privilege is.
[NAME] has a drive that [NAME] doesn't at all. He cares more about his hair than buying a house for his mom from what I have seen.
The best daughter a father could ask for.
I'm not worthy to watch this haha
Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining
No it's not. It's two people legally allowed to kiss kissing. Whatever stigma you have is yours and not shared by everyone.

I hate this world.

Because [NAME] was underage at the time of filming. IIRC he rips [NAME] dress in a much more revealing way in the book.
Dude was posting about the score, as-in, ‚Äúare you kidding me, we lost to the kings at home on a last second shot‚Äù
The chubby one scurrying away against the baseboards has me cracking up. Typical hamster.
You know how I know Boomers are trash? They love [NAME].
Thanks- I'll take your advice.
I do that when I don't do my hair and I don't want anyone to see me looking like that
Grew up together obviously. So if you want to have an alligator friendly family, raise your babies with baby alligators!
This is also Morning Consult, which isn't the most reliable of polls.
I just bought myself a Bears pullover starter jacket. 8th grade me would be jealous!!
It probably will if you roll your eyes so hard.
I would suffer a heat stroke or die of diarrhea
oh Ye crazy again for 2019 huh
Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.
Yes!! I have noticed this so many times. Like it will just pop up after I learn it.
If they killed off women they‚Äôd start finding reasons to kill eachother off soon enough too.
See? Your mind is great! You think like [NAME]. And that's pretty cool. He's a dang genious. :)
I hate that attitude, as if it's every woman's, purpose, dream, and personal duty to reproduce.
Spoken like proud slaughter-bound crotch fruit!
So what? The LW doesn't. want. more. children.
Thanks for the info
It's not really controversial any year, but he's commentating a game with [NAME] in it. He has the counterpoint right in front of him.
Do you want help with the big words ?
Grow up.
Could or couldn't?
Looks like he has a history of being an awful human:
i love his face for that split second after he is hit
Hello! how‚Äôs it going?
i never really laughed at it, but its still one of my favorite movies. i view it more as a slice-of-life drama.
How do you know all this? It‚Äôs interesting and true and I‚Äôm curious how you know?
I really don't like the way she says zombie. It sounds like she tryed to fill up space.
> I know plenty of religious/semi-religious [NAME] who are not [NAME] in practice or belief. What term do they use to identify themselves as, though?
Well said. And I love your username. üëë
> Basically tell them to screw off and realize their selfishness You mean my grandparents / aunt?
this is really all [NAME] is.
What? A [NAME] supporter purposefully misrepresenting the facts? You don't say.
If we shoot by accident we don't keep feeding him when we see he is using siphon that give terimuns a barely a single clamity shot
Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else.
oh shit u meant the actual post... yeh i live in china this all we gotüòÇüòÇ
You should‚Äôve baked it in the oven, huge difference in quality. One of my favorite lonely Friday night Netflix meals.
Congrats bud! Hope it was a good 21st!
You have clear issues, get help.
never worth it.
Baseless assumptions about cops on Reddit without any context?
It‚Äôs a policy debate round, it‚Äôs not meant to be taken as true
I was about to say the same lol.
False. Leftists do not believe in private property so paying rent is offensive to them
My point is we have been shit for the most of the season, today we are just shit in a new formation
Not as nice as [NAME].
How close a friend ? Acquaintance friend.. close friend.. close to someone else in the band ?
This is what they're addressing when [NAME] is asking if it was OK to kill the step dad.
That's the biggest annoyance I have with this sub the past year; how little people value [NAME]. I don't get it.
The vagoo has been stretched over the bike, it allows for a comfortable and pleasurable ride, pretty innovative and cleaver way to operate a locomotive.
Genetic science is changing the jewelry game?
Totally forgot that, my bad
No, and I think someone would have to do some serious mental gymnastics to convince themselves it is. It'd be taking advantage of an incapacitated person.
Once or twice a day
Falcons fan here, We relish in the moments like the one on Sunday.
Her lying, narcotics addicted, pedophilic grandmother with physical ailments that cause her to be a serious lethal danger on multiple levels.
I clearly recall being told the same thing in ‚Äò97, when I was driving a ‚Äò74...except the years were different obv.
This is so sad. [NAME], play 'bitch lasagna'
A SWEDISH penis enlarger pump? make sure you read the instructions by austin powers.
Look at CBG as well. It's got anti inflammatory properties. Wifey feels its the best medicine for her cramps.
Well done! That's usually the hardest part is to start going and I hope it helps!
Yikes. That‚Äôs straight up paranoid, you can tell they were looking through comments for someone to rage at. 
I'm know Ashtabula. I'm from Lorain. That's cool that the company got bigger though.
i dont, whats that
[NAME] is just the man to accept that! ::cough:: MELO ::cough::
It only got things right that were in the email leak
Yah, I'm a bad girl. In fact I'm bad at everything.
Stay safe guys
This is genius
He just wasn't registered with the state. He has a BS in EE and works as an electrical engineer. What a stupid law
"Thanks for answering instead of ""but hillary""."
So fucking awesome. Cheers from Brazil.
Sooo...Kyle is jealous of LVP's Queen Bee status.
LOL...love nagy shock-faced
I get that but there may be some folks out there that aren‚Äôt like that. Any help would be much appreciated.
You have my good wishes and words of encouragement! There is so much wisdom in ‚Äúone day at a time.‚Äù
True i hate going to parties or concerts but love going to a bar or a houseparty.
1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good
Only fair - although they they could have reported it as 0-0 since ND never showed up.
This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
All the people in this thread are fucking disgusting
I don‚Äôt get why he hasn‚Äôt brought his insta account back, he did used to use it from time to time
I keep telling you, I just grow sorghum here. 
I dont know, she seems pretty gangster to me.
What a legend.
Yeah, in this case, the difference between 17 and 18 is about 8 years. 
what a lovely gift, you are blessed my friend, she picked you!!!! use it in good health
I'm sure he'd love to do that. Just have to get a few others on board first haha.
You guys are well behind
Which is why people sell on TPT...
[NAME] is a traitor to this country.
They are a couple in love so what's your beef.
You fool you're using logic on a show that is clearly not bound by any
Min Gung in Glastonbury also has all you can eat sushi. Always a good time!
You might have better luck
Sorry, I swapped back to Canada unclearly, to respond to the comments about it.
You're a turd
Me too :,)
100% this is enough to make me want to watch
Very scary.
Wasnt much to ruin.
That last paragraph before the edit lmao. So fake it hurts.
cool story bro
Fun fact that I learned not too long ago, [NAME] did the voice over for [NAME] during the ‚Äúindeed‚Äù era of Kaientai 
Did the words get unbanned?!
Yeah, but the title sentence is all that really matters.
Cognitive dissonance. I don't support diagnosis via internet but she needs medical help NOT a medical license.
I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing, thanks!
Also one of my favorite parts of this story.
You know even when women wear their hair natural they‚Äôre still putting products in it right?
I hieaa i just trip out how your lds and not know or here. Nevermo here a d hears when i was a kid
Thank you, thank you. More people need to hear this.
I‚Äôm clueless unless someone tells me straight up that they‚Äôre into me. But this may just be me
It's too small of a traffic circle to make sense
i also love this one
I often send my female friends Love poems. Oh wait, no, no I don't, because that is super weird. 
Why is there a huge focus on the living room? The perspective confused me so much.
There is something legitimately wrong with you
drink ur milk and you'll grow to be a big strong man
I'm quite interested as well!
Sure, rape isn't caused by poverty. You can compare poor whites vs poor hispanics too. 
Note 2.
[NAME] is a New York populist. You might as well have voted for a [NAME].
Maybe you just enjoy the process of digging? Does it have to be somebody you‚Äôre attracted to or have you tried stalking a random person?
Love how they all claim no one pays any attention to the comments then acknowledge a comment section personality.
What's wrong with in group preference? Every other group does this. It's not a right vs left thing.
He was just trying to sit down I think. Poor guy, doesn‚Äôt deserve all this shit from reddit.
Sounds like you have the situation firmly under control. Keep maintaining boundaries, focusing on the things that matter, and ignoring her need for drama. 
We‚Äôre not upset. We‚Äôre disgusted. You‚Äôre disgusting.
It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!
You should like a troll. Not saying you are.
Seriously? Never knew... but yea that would make sense
Thank you. I hope things get better for you, and I believe in you, too.
This is amazing.
Wow must be a good market. Could maybe hit up to $150 a day
>I think this is the same for most people. Exactly.
It's her |_STAND^¬¨
Wait what...
Well I like [NAME] but other than her, I don't know any interesting asian youtubers. so help me out
im in love with this comment
I‚Äôm legit cracking up at the landlord part
I can‚Äôt believe this blatant police brutality
A little disturbing that this person knows the names of Auschwitz doctors off by heart.
> [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
My reaction to seeing both of these lists
Now I don‚Äôt blame [NAME] for his way of thinkingüòÇ people like this wtf
I laughed harder than I should have at this reply. Then the sadness hit me when I realized it wasn't meant to be funny.
Apparently my state üòî
you did drug her though, and assault her by undressing her and taking her photo. you committed multiple crimes. you need professional help.
Ah. That‚Äôs where I left it. Now where are the keys
Is that meat or veggies?
They're a double edge sword. Not too heavy on the beauty, but they always immensely helped me to immerse.
Yes! Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from üòÇüòÇ
In the first combo if you just do the b+k instead of even bothering to kick it does 1 more damage Not much obviously but yeah just a thought
Cool, hope that helps.
This was literally the first examole that came to mind for me hahaha
Women aren't smart enough to see an intellectual kino du art like [NAME] multiple times
So they are up thanks
I am only sharing what my friends said, what their experience was. I found that a bit surprising.
[NAME] is playing good
Thanks. I will come to you with all of my apple-related questions!
That's amazing...I have to admit, Google making me do this while on VPN has moved me to Bing. 
The intro in that video looks like a sand storm on there, imagine a sand storm while playing GA on that map, it would be awesome!
You‚Äôre right to defend your property is more valuable than the person who‚Äôs trying to steal it.
There are more candies in the picture on those 2 brownies than there are in the entire pack of 6!
Even if it was true, what would they actually gain from misrepresenting the data?
Oh dear - I can spot a problem with this...
"Part of me wants to say ""Yea, that happened."""
[NAME], she said the same laughably ignorant thing about unemployment as you... so you have as much expertise on the topic as a 29 year-old bartender. 
Desperately miss this, [NAME] was one of my favourites at finishing with big choruses 
No is just apologize and explain the situation
From one finale to the next finale should be one whole year so she‚Äôs gonna be pregnant for a whole year lmao
No, because asses that hot don't come in trenta
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
I feel like that‚Äôs not the best spot for a beach
[NAME] Twitter wouldn‚Äôt know what to do if [NAME] teamed up with [NAME] lol
Bless you.
This is just so sweet! That's all. :). So sweet.
ahhhhh ok I thought it was the other way round, thanks for clearing it up.
First of all, no. Second of all, she probable is still in love with you 
I can watch test cricket, this would be no problems. Honestly though I'm annoyed I missed it, hopefully there's a re run
Glad to hear it has kept going strong. And employed your dad for that long.
I'm confused. Where did I propose anything? I'm just describing how things currently work and what to consider...
I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
I would like to suggest one that's like Would You Rather. More of a dark comedy but oh so good. Cheap Thrills is amazing
I love Chinese buffets. All the ones in my town are gone, all buffets are gone, sucks 
Hahaha the first fall is the best ha
Pinkwashing a violent, repressive institution isn‚Äôt cool. 
Like who? The one guy stranded in desert already hating his life...
I think the best way to think of the age is that [NAME] is 17, [NAME] is 19 and [NAME] is 20.
YES!!!! I will never understand why some post rants complaining that they cant make $$ off another persons hard work.
Neat, it‚Äôs screenshotted from my Facebook so I doubt that it‚Äôs an exact one my friend 
Mom will get sad. [NAME] still good. Hanging out with friends still good. Money buying foodie exp is still good.
This looks delicious, I wish I had all ingredients on hand, because I would make this tomorrow.
Ah cool, i heard more or less the same story but in Newcastle. 
Obv a joke product you'd find in a novelty toy shop.
Came on her face and she told you? Wow disrespect. Either she didn't know how you really felt or didn't care. Sorry about your luck
Thought [NAME] had a bad game. For such a strong player he didn't get to keep much of the ball when in possession.
are you a genji main cause i feel the same way
The likes of [NAME] utter genius cannot be fathomed by mere mortals
I love this, and #2
You're my mvp for the night haha. I'll drop by there tonight, thanks!
Wound a little tight? Everyone respects him. People are just having a bit of fun.
Oh look even more whinging by a Brexshitter about how its all gonna sort it self out fine, such fantastic info.
He'll have to leave at some point. So might as well get him to a club where you don't have to despise him
This is awesome. What did they play?
Yeah we're just awful. Sadly that's too friggin' true just now!
WHY THE FUCK IS BAYLESS ISOING
No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
Is not that safe here are links I posted in other
Welcome folks, what‚Äôs going on in Ottawa?
It still seems Fairy popular, I might get it. Thanks for the tip!
Thank you. Well said.
Just wanted to mention--Brazos Bend is closed due to flooding until next week.
I don't feel alive anymore. I don't feel anything. I'm just numb all over. All I know is I want it to stop
‚ÄúInstagram might suck but it doesn‚Äôt suck‚Äù
Looks like something translated from Irish to English using google.
Omg I love it
You need to look in the mirror if you going to say that [NAME] is overrated yet want to trade him for scrubs like Dedmon
I think he's showing the scissor cutting himself in half to illustrate the type of discourse it produces when it cuts populations in half
We all saw it, my American friend. Now go and fix your government.
I just hope [NAME] gets hired
you are correct, but now it is over. and i cry
RemindMe! 3 months
Wife of a lawyer. This is correct
sorry it was absolutely not like that
Oh, it was THAT episode?
Yes, I will GI A+B6 LH more often, it's really good. Thank you for the tip!
A buddy of mine took his exes ring and taped it to the top of a firework mortar then set it off. It was glorious
Where's my thank you for that flair, hm? This is theft.
Dirty secret. They retired the decks until they got a doozy.
ugh, same. it also gave me the shakes, so I quit. so far, I've found Trintellix to be a nice compromise
Funny thing, I work at a restaurant and it happened today, which is what pushed me to post this. 
I'm just glad they'll chill out in the main sub, they were swarmin.
omg no way he totally screwed himself over there XD
Everyone is fed up of it, but it'll be over soon and we'll be glad of it then. Just like the Newlands Cross flyover.
I‚Äôm all for this, but is anyone staying in these hotels? 
I highly doubt they would do that in CA. That would put prices at 36$/pack and no one is going to pay 9$/pod.
That canopy looks like it could take someones head off.
Both but which one being the most used isn't really important.
Thank you! When I have more, I'll post it.
lmao no. *assigned* female. Doctors can be wrong, especially wrt intersex children. The rest is just words to say things, not actually responding to anything.
Born and raised in L.A. Raiders fans are the most obnoxious and stupid fans there are. Imagine cowboys [NAME] tenfold except they've got violent tendencies.
Thanks!! Been avoiding this but I literally am in that area for the Elk pelt so I better put my emotions in a case
You can say what you want about USM, but we love our baseball.
As an NHL tv subscriber I prefer that home broadcast, but I see your point. GO KNIGHTS GO from Oklahoma!!!
Oh... Cool
I‚Äôm sorry I only have orange ones :(
too bad for [NAME] we don't negotiate with terrorists.
Probably also saves money. An extra 3 napkins you dont use each time multiplied by thousands of people per day adds up quick
Anti-vaxers aren't funny anymore, now they're just scary...
I hope they bring him back. Last year was awesome
It‚Äôs a disgusting mix of mayonnaise, ketchup, and pickle relish.
I was wondering that as well....
That‚Äôs my neighbor!
We still luv u
and of course if that happens then there's no way it could be true. as if a protester could also be a paedophile.........
Let's all go to Dragon Laaaaaand!
Hey, don't steal lmao
Wow first fight in a while where I don't want either dude to lose.
But really Vanilla Ice is scum RIP [NAME] and [NAME]
"""Kids stay by the ram it's not safe"""
I‚Äôm impressed.
You are an awesome partner.
I almost forgot about you for a minute
They're only part of it. There are subliminals as well. My sa is cured. Have a blast keeping yours if that's what you want
Made me cry and my one year old golden who was laying near my feet ended up coming up and snuggling me.
Best to end the CCP of China than to end the world
>outsourced independent contractor Dude there is no way [NAME] knows these words.
Fuck with these giveaways.
Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.
Has he done this with other world leaders, too? Or only [NAME]?
thank you man
[NAME] looks veeeery nervous
Lets hope he gets a good birthday game ‚ò∫
Im sorry, my autocorret happened. But i think you can read between the lines? Or maybe just go full r*** :)
All those things are definitely your fault. She is much better off without you.
I love [NAME]. But I‚Äôm not sure there is a single player in he nba who he can guard
Gotta admit, I chuckled at this one
the future is now old man
I'm working hard to see if this meme is even feasible.
We look like Hawks at this time. Good old days
well she will not be able to do it with [NAME]...
> Update they would've never been arrested or charged if they weren't black. Epitome of the disgusting systemic racism in this country #UBERPOOLtoPrisonPipeline
Reminds me of the blueberry girl from [NAME]
Thank you so much! This summarizes a lot!
I asked for trick candles. Thank you for the gift! What a lovely day this turned out to be!
Happy Cake Day Baby!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm guessing theyve been together for a few years and once she was no longer a teenager and it wasn‚Äôt as risqu√© he lost interest.
My favorite kind of post
Very very nice to see this irl. Nice post üëåüèº
Damn, I need to find this trade school which lets you make your personal animals
Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...
My toes hurt watching this
Original:
Way more intense than [NAME] fans
Yes. His name is [NAME]. He was good friends with [NAME] and used to make YouTube videos with [NAME], another rapper.
"Look, [NAME]! I'm a cat. ""Ffs, [NAME]. Get off the ground. You're embarrassing me."""
Could be depression with psychotic features. Talk to your doctor asap!
I‚Äôm ready to see yet another person fall tonight.
"So is liking [NAME] enormous eyebrows ""biological"" too? /s ^I ^think ^her ^eye ^brows ^look ^cool"
"Translation: ""I don't think restaurant employees should be allowed to express frustration under any circumstances."""
How can you tell
He came to us from a farm
"[NAME] would love her!!! ""Do you forgive Daddy?"" "
I'd say Rick and Morty fans. I'm a fan of both but I feel that Rick and Morty fans take everything way more seriously.
Trial by jury of my peers is honestly my worst fear
There is some serious congnitive dissonance going on. I know, we are one's to talk, but I think cheaters are a little more self-aware. 
I love many fanarts of this paring, but this is one of my favorite ones. :)
Well, shrinking of your d could be a motivation to quit porn.
I‚Äôd kind of be kind of shocked if Chili wants us to hit mostly ground balls, especially with how hard the shifts are nowadays. 
I think it‚Äôll be a flashback
It's so much worse with a child involved. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
I once looked at the I-95 and was hospitalised for weeks.
I'm from Lebanon and have been supporting Celtic since 2006 ! Glad to see there are other people from around the world here !
Thanks!!!
[NAME] insulting his fanbase has literally been a hallmark of his persona from the beginning of barstool
Can we forget that this moment happened
I love you [NAME]!
Insane song.
I hate you.
Did you see the Beauty News video about it? One of their Estee Lauder products turned out to have been expired before they even bought it ü§¢
Really? How would they know what pharmacy you want to visit?
I think it's safe to say I've peaked. 16/25 on the second half wouldn't all that surprising but I probably whiffed on [NAME]
"It's funny cause you say socialists have an ""ignorance of economics"" while posting on an anarcho-capitalist sub :) I think you clearly fundamentally misunderstand socialism. "
hey the 5 riders per van per day are upset
Ambien you are my new favortist person ever!
Maybe yes, maybe not. But in the end she still is an adult that choose to have sexual intercourse with a minor, regardless of the gender.
That's not really a solid method.
Also, note how the First Order recruits....children. That certinetly could lead to rampant abuse.
I miss [NAME].
The acl is somewhere inside yes. Some people also said it was a lateral ligament. Hope he can recover quickly.
Definitely not just on this sub. I keep seeing them on Instagram too.
i'm enjoying this so much
Wow... That looks great! Would love to get some actual vintage jerseys like that someday. Keep my eyes on eBay. Lol
Yeah I don‚Äôt know where you live. Also smooth haha
I agree we got to look at our team, not the players we have traded... good luck to them. Go dodgers!!
Think we need a sub dedicated to miserable reviews.
Woah I never thought of that... thank you!I'll say my news resolution is to bake more lol
I‚Äôm afraid too. It‚Äôs the not knowing what will happen that scares me.
agreed....seems that due to plot force shes starting to slip
Awesome! [NAME] is stilling kicking it through the uprights!
She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
And why didn‚Äôt Connecticut improve as well?
The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
I‚Äôm about to have a heart attack tonight
I cant stop seeing SS VS BM
>[NAME] & [NAME], [NAME] are only DMs who could be best DMs at the moment Three completely different players. 
Some wonderful pictures here, it's always cool to see what things actually looked like rather than just paintings/depictions in movies. 
You kind of look like [NAME]. Very cute.
roll a blunt, walk over and strike a conversation.... or mind your fcking business
Thanks, that's what I was looking for! 
I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate.
>[NAME] I don't know why, but that gave me a good laugh. Thank you. 
Post this on /r/nba lol
Stop over in old Windsor town mate, we got it all.
I'm like ''The F*** have you achieved with the joint patrols you have done with USA? What you'll achieve with the ones with Russia?''
Yeah let‚Äôs sit this one out.
Cheers, mate! I know you can do it! :)
[NAME] looks so much better than she did at the premiere. Her lashes aren‚Äôt fucked up and the high pony is great.
Emo!!
Ask him out for a drink.
I can hardly wait all the picture posts of this sign with the sunset flooding this subreddit just like all the craptastic skyline pictures already on here.
Sorry I was being facetious
Late to the party, but if it were young boys talking about stabbing women in the vagina would it still be okay?
I like His And Hers Poker Podcast
Why is it ethically wrong for him to lose half his shit? In what context?
She is so brave üò•üò≠
Keep your expectations low and you're less likely to be disappointed?
Hey now I didn't flunk out of med school to be insulted like this!
Welp....I think your question came across as judgmental. Why did you ask it?
"""do y'all think I'd really come out lookin like this unless it was forreal"" She's got a solid case."
That's why many places have it at 18 or 19. It's not like 16 and 25 are the only options.
I take it you'll be consistent in this stance and never go to the doctor, because there's nothing you can do to stop it. 
"""I love animals but I hate PETA."" - [NAME] "
oh no, I didn‚Äôt mean one of my boyfriends haha, I meant one of his things. we‚Äôre not in an open relationship
What did he say?
The good [NAME]
Dammmn girl them make up skills! Your eyes are so wonderfully icy!!
This guy seems like a real genius.
I'm glad :)
Last week was her week. She killed everything about that episode
i think its cool because its a hybrid that comes in stickshift
It's Dra'am!!!!
On Your Mind- Kaskade Snow in Gothenburg-Kasbo Fuck Was I-Jenny [NAME] (Morgan Page Remix) Now or Never Now-Metric
After she hands [NAME] the nomination ;)
it's basically a mock selective exam
What a good bear c:
You're right! Color me wrong! I sincerely apologize. Smack MY darn head!
Thanks I‚Äôm falling in love, and it‚Äôs also cost efficient!
This shit ain't rocket science GateKeeper
oh gosh [NAME] had issues as well with someone and his leg i forgot.
Look what time it is. It's Fuck You, It's January!
Not sure what's cringe about this, even if you disagree with the political message
I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway
It's a Falling In Reverse song, which makes it even more terrifying
Normal people talk to other people.
It's because attractive people don't have to work on their personality usually
[NAME] only runs in [NAME] shorts!
Mod to the rescue! Thanks haha
Thank you [NAME].. Another disaster you created.
Plz add ye and ksg. Thanks, ye
The sea was angry that day my friends...
Very good to know! Thanks!
Cry some more
Also the fishing has been terrible for a month now. I am about to take the 5 story jump my friends.
Company car? Oh boy he‚Äôs in trouble now.
As ironic as it sounds but her being a non factor is what ultimately won them the game (compared to inting [NAME])
I can't help it. It's just so perfect.
Poor [NAME], three lovers in 15 seasons
[NAME] is [NAME].
There is no greater form of oppression than being called a bigot. #debateme #babyhitler #otherpeoplesbabies
here
Thanks! I didn't understand til now
I‚Äôve woken up next to some shocking things but just imagine finding the top of a police car in your room.
In doing so, they gave humanity a cinematic treasure for the ages. 
It was a 9 bang which was completely different...
You know I‚Äôve always wondered what this song was about. Thank you.
Conservatives love to agree with cryptofacists and pretend all accusations are a smear campaign.
I'd imagine it's a team of people in marketing.
i love it
I'd love a 2D animated [NAME] trilogy. You can really go wild with animation and wild is exactly how I'd describe [NAME].
Something my mom always told me is to say what you‚Äôre going to use a gift for in your thank you note.
Interesting. I recognize way more of the 2019 names than I did from last year. Any hope that means I'm getting younger?!
Amazing. The perfect words for it
This. One of my biggest pet peeves. What the hell does it even mean?
Someone in my class said foreskin instead of forehead during a biology presentation and I still remember
Was not aware. I know it's bad but I rather keep my head in the sand on this one because I still want to like [NAME].
For those who are wondering, that would leave you with about $1,000,000
Yep, and because you do, you‚Äôre going on the highway to hell
Are you being sarcastic for good news? lol
Pres named his business barstool. The expectation of stupidity is the brand.
I‚Äôm excited to experience Denver for the first time! All I‚Äôve heard is how amazing it is
[NAME] and [NAME] were awesome.
Do *you* believe yourself to be a clone?
It's not a recessed center, there's an edge cut out around the outside. It's from the melting pot, best fondue restaurant! 
That was a quick delete!
I wasn‚Äôt aware of that. Thanks for the info. That makes the decision a lot easier.
Are you saying he put in the wrong oil?
I was responding to the title of the post (not the article). Did you call OP racist? I‚Äôm guessing not.
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm to say I‚Äôll say it anyway
Thank you. Let's see if it does :)
Better than just saying hey :)
Reading this made me pretty damn happy. Congrats hope it works out for you two.
How do people eat off paper plates when they‚Äôre not at a bbq?!
Despite how much the Liberals and NDP apparently hate each other they really do work well together.
Oops, accidentally fed the troll. Ah well, we all gotta eat. Guess I'm feeling charitable. üòâ
It might be the other way around! They seem to have a lot of awkward conversations while eating dinner.

You are doing your kids such a grand favor! I wish I were raised like that.
DELETE THAT SCREEN SHOT! NOW!!!
Sorry *ss Crabtree is there so it's a possibility.
Replace OG for [NAME] then, remove the pick, add [NAME] for salary. I love OG but [NAME] worth it
And Tranna for Toronto.
What exactly are we looking at?
He was forced into this marriage
I was petrified...
Oh I'm sure you're fun at parties
It does seem like the Astros get a lot of charity trades.
Who could have thought that anti-semitism would have taken hold in feminism? Why would anyone think that animosity toward an entire group of people is welcome there?
I'm a [NAME] and tripping has only strengthened my faith. To each their own.
Good for you to get out of it!! seems like a nasty example of narc abuse. No contact!
*people‚Äôs ..this is awkward
Holy shit that‚Äôs nothing
Now I feel like an idiot calling it a beamer for the 15 years I played baseball.
You will miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take, you just gotta take a chance and see.
Srs glad she's going to stop cancering herself

Have you told this story before? It seems really familiar.
He looks so dapper.
"Kinda off topic but is the ""More from this artist"" broken for anyone else? Usually it just shows the same album 3 times."
Feels like hitreg in general is pretty poor lately.
Man. Really bad last possession there. Bummer.

No thanks, he‚Äôs already been flushed
Never seen an abandoned piss trolley at a bus stop in Armadale ever
Not knowing what it is, for one thing.
I just come right out and admit it. Saves on disappointment.
Here is the original post

I look forward to finally trying the game out and helping you guys pump up those kill counts
Thanks so much for typing out such an expansive, detailed response!
Aw, nothing gets chocolate out, see?
As soon as I read the title the music for this game started playing in my head.
Check our Four Peaks Brewery. Great food great beer
bold stance from [NAME] here
What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
I think we can all agree that [NAME] sucks
"Can anyone here show where in the Quran it states ""not to delay your salah for anything"" ?"
Sorry bb :( I understand that feeling all too well, haha
[NAME] is huge fucking liar, but you seem to like him.
DDay was only a month ago...slow down. Get yourself healed up. Hang with friends. Read a relationship book.
You're right, thanks for pointing that out, I've edited it now. Carry on.
I suppose I failed to lay the sarcasm on thick enough, should have gone with the full billion dollar contract... Oh well, live and learn! lol 
I love Skyline Chili but I totally understand why other people don't. Same with Imo's.
On its own it looks really stupid, but it‚Äôs kinda cute all in the little pot
Technically they did not. Technically we were forced ti give 1b to 10 Irish constituencies to put them in charge after failing to vite them.
That was informative. Thank you.
Is there a source link? Id like to put it as my screen saver :)
One day I was really desperate and tried putting warming balms that are intended for sore muscles on my lower tummy and it helps so much!

That whole episode has some heartbreaking moments. It is probably my top Parks And Rec episode.
Oh. You‚Äôre one of.... ^*those.*
You don‚Äôt know what would happen if you lost weight, so why don‚Äôt you focus solely on that step first.
Go back to class and show you're English teacher yore post. They'd have notes for ewe.

Cool thanks, posted on there just now! I'm not a super big reddit user so I'm glad that you are telling me all this haha.
Time consuming too, but buying a box that size outright is stupidly expensive‚Äîeven if you order a bundle of 25 at a time.
these have to be probably the worst presses ive ever seen, sorry mate
thank you. I've blocked him on Facebook and text.
Thanks, do we know how this document has been publicised, and if it's not a fake document 
just some freak accident with the medicine he was prescribed. He had a seizure
Lmao my jaw dropped when she started talking about that stuff with her friend
You've shifted the goalposts from first novel to first modern novel... You people always complain that incels don't provide any support for their claims.
Fuck isn't it nice to have a [NAME] on the team?
Everyone knows the original and true ending to dodgeball had [NAME] losing in the end.
Warning: Ear rape
Nah, I lied. I don't judge people's kinks and I like that [NAME] always moves me.
"Could you explain what you mean by ""both sides"" crap?"
Replace smug with thug and you'll see how racist you are
They prefer the term pro-life instead of anti-choice. Unless you want to be anti-life
Barring an injury, [NAME] will be up by May at the latest. You're not going to sign him for one month.
I would feel like the biggest idiot if I made your comment.
That‚Äôs not populism, that‚Äôs demagoguery. Subtle, but big difference. 
In other words, being a woman but not identifying with your oppression. How special
Best sub ever
Screw DBs swill, their creepy Children of God (cult) employees, and the traffic mess it creates on Rural in Tempe
Try really warm water instead. It's awesome.
Getting raises and heading to Utah to get our teeth kicked in playing 90s style. [NAME] wouldn't have it any other way.
If the ball is past the receiver, they're fair game. The refs may have thought it was close enough live.
It‚Äôs a shame, I‚Äôve had numerous friends with disabilities but I‚Äôve never treated them any less then my friends without.
Yeah I think most of what [NAME] says is sensible policy but this would be a step too far.
Thank you bot.
They played loud music on a ‚Äòschool night‚Äô, seriously! You‚Äôre backing the bastards here just to be contrary.
Man that‚Äôs cool, I like this sub. You‚Äôre a cool mod
"[NAME] to [NAME]: ""Don't try and tell me how to defend"""
To be fair I was in that crowd and there was barely any room to move.
A dry phone?
Nah. It's their job. Just tip well
Just being friendly and sociable for the family get together!
Highly unlikely, but damn would love this to happen.
If it was communism, the poor lad would be killed
Wow! Prayers for everyone there.
That‚Äôs a good idea, thanks
[NAME], let's celebrate together, y'all will be the king of New York. Praise Marks.
Oooo she has a crush on you that‚Äôs embarrassing!
It is SO gross, I despise him and think he's a gross predator. 
Sometimes when you like someone you like them enough to hang out with people you don't like because the person you like likes those people.
I will burn the X down if we lose this game tonight.
Haha okay. Much love brother!
The truly great thing about this is how he looks down, disgusted, as if the comment were down there üòÇ
So I play competitive with a group of people and being the one widow is most likely fake or just wild speculation.
If you're in luck, she might be waiting to be independent and find you but the chances are very slim. 
Could they have written a more uninspiring Press Release. Hopefully it is more about [NAME] than [NAME] and [NAME].
...Great. Hope your insurance doesn't fuck you.
That‚Äôs what the pelicans would ask for. If you were in their shoes, what would u ask for?
This is what that kid in kindergarten who always had juice stains around his mouth and was probably named [NAME] grew up to be.
Seriously. OP needs to get their shit together.
Aww that makes me happy!
I wouldn't want to take any of his medals away but lets also not act like he was instrumental in either.
And of course you need to make sure it‚Äôs boiled over hard with a side of your finest jelly beans, raw. 
Get this religious bullshit out of here smh [NAME] doesn't give a fuck about who wins or losses a child's game
Help, I'm scared and want to go back.
So you‚Äôre telling me [NAME] hasn‚Äôt got a baby face?
Since our newest addition to this holiday I've included a new, fun tradition where you hide a yellow toupee inside of the president's tree.
Everything should be there from the Cash homepage... Is there something specific you can put your finger on that you don't like as much?
Post in Meme thread please
Did you guys use condoms before? Or was it just the mental hurdle of knowing you weren't taking any birth control?
You are not alone. We do not sit in this darkness alone, even though other lack of light may make it seem so. 
Stoicism isn't a bad thing. The idea that all men HAVE to be or by nature are stoic is.
"Also, if you start looking for your partner to get mad at you when depression ""kicks in"" then you're probably starting it yourself. "
He‚Äôs a very annoying person and illogical can‚Äôt work with someone like this
Poor fella just got his arms out of plaster and we‚Äôre already making fun of him
We don't do that here
I feel like that might be every 2 years instead of every year
Your comment is kinda wasted. He can't read.
[NAME], I had. It *was* a repressed memory, thanks.
Your brain is confusing itself. Try not to think about it too much. It's.. real weird to consider.
Its wild to find such similar situations on this sub!
I love this 10/10
Anyone remember Space Dandy? It was short and stupid, but the animation was great. Very tounge in cheek.
Thanks a lot
What? Fur definitely shows up on beige. She stayed for 35 minutes and held one dog who was wearing a coat.
I just don't think [NAME] is the guy to do something like this.
No unless it‚Äôs like someone you were close to that‚Äôs passed away like a parent or something. Kissing your pillow is kinda weird though.
Starting?? BF4 is a lot of fun when you havent played in a while. Just faster and more immersive.
Um, except you would be trusting your private key with a third party. I would recommend verifying a signed message though as a feature to be added.
I'm so excited for this game!! üòÑ
I'm so drunk I cheereds a bot as if it was OP LOL
That sounds so awesome. Thanks for talking about it.
But we love how they enslave, rape and decimate civilizations in the name of [NAME]. You guys just don‚Äôt get it and are probably racist. 
What? That is the most recent big meme, it's not cringy
Doubt [NAME] will solve our problems
What's the problem? The worst aspect is the DRM which is easily circumvented, and of course giving money to Amazon 
This gave me ultimate anxiety
I mostly just feel like this life is a test I‚Äôm failing, and I‚Äôll have another chance eventually 
I‚Äôve had to remove fallen trees on snowy roads because the forest service is not working as much. Shits a little fucked.
He was an awful HC, is in his 70s and has repeatedly said he doesn‚Äôt want to do it again. 
I always give my disclaimer when he asks for my phone number. I understand and respect my situation could be a deal breaker for some.
Have a nice day
She should not defend herself? Stop blaming both sides.
Heads up guys before you scrutinize me, Yes I know it's ED not ER apologies in advance :)
Eat it raw. No vitamins for purple hair head with butterflies tattoos. Sucka
[NAME] I HATE those.
How many is that now? Feels like the 4th one now
THAT DOES IT!
Nice, I like it. A truly unusual pairing. 
That‚Äôs my favorite way to introduce myself tbh
In all seriousness, stereotyping does suck and I feel for you. But stop being a crazy horse lady and maybe you can change people's minds. Lol
Im always worrying about the same thing, thats why Im always posting and within hours freaking out and deleting my posts 
Exhibit A, lol
Today on someone flamed me in chat
Glad it was helpful!
I laughed but unfortunately [NAME] is our problem because of how close Canada and USA relations are.
Well damn I‚Äôm going to the Buckingham today
I did this once with a chimichanga. I was 11 and I cried

Strawberry lemonade by ziip pods is the best I've ever tasted.
I told you, he‚Äôs not a menace!
Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.
Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.
That weighs heavy on the heart, I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss
Drag em to one
She won't be happy single. One of her biggest wishes is that she wants someone to love her for her, not her claim. 
"Thanks, I was confused, too. I was like, ""how did your grandma rinse vegetables??"" Lol"
Uncle and niece? Man nooo noo
That's just....sorry, but stupid is the only correct word.
Wow. All that up and down cycling. These people must feel 80 by the time they're 30.
Well son of a....
I'm surprised not to see whining about [NAME] books more often, speaking of children.
That would expand his torso and ribs which probably hurts
Dude your source on the school says they would investigate. Not a condemnation. Not in any stretch.
Ssssssh, don't tell them. It's a natural way to filter the gene pool from stupid people. 
Exactly! The mob mentality of these people is sad! Let's bring some love and peace into the world!
Having a good list of alternatives would be something great we could produce
[NAME] is gonna smash tj ez
Yup! Was a great shoot, can't wait for the video to debut so people can enjoy all the hard work.

Good luck trying to get out of the membership. They won‚Äôt make it easy.
Eh, not in Europe, it ain't.
You came to die

How has the season not even started, and Plastique already is my fav
Wow thanks for pointing that out, haven't heard that one before.
Awesome map!
[NAME] got some mutton chop sideburns coming in.

Someone hold me
Kernel Seasons bruh
[NAME] has aged me 10 years in the last 3 months
No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?
I love the way he looks at them to see if he should keep panting.
Thanks for sharing your thought. You have a fair and reasonable perspective. Happy New Year!
I love Florida
Too bad it's the wrong kind of blows!!!
Cockles, like the shellfish? Oysters clams and cockles!!!

I have crowns and I thought I needed a mouth guard but it seems like I don‚Äôt anymore.
The best advice I have, which it seems most people completely overlook: Have fun.
He doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs terrified, cries and hugs you. Basically one of the scariest scenes in TWD.
Her body, her space. If she was uncomfortable, then he should be respecting her.
Occupation badges are dumb and I‚Äôm sad they made the transition to OCP.

Aww [NAME] giving [NAME] a pat on the back that‚Äôs cute
You really really summed that up. Perfectly actually.
You're creepy
I wonder if this is why the universe keeps expanding. Because we're constantly filling it up with new words and new sentences.
I tried it that way first and thought this was better, thanks for the input though! 
For me yes. I did it my whole life, and I regret now. Cause I could've had something with the girls I didn't approach.
Gotta play the identity politics game. She‚Äôs black and a lady.

Oh [NAME]... now you‚Äôre stealing my lines.
Tbh the giant cereal bowl bath is about as least cursed as it gets. ...I loved that episode
No, I‚Äôm saying that ‚Äúnot getting an abortion‚Äù is the default option, and takes less deliberate effort than getting an abortion.

Either's good
Wrong sub, mane.
I feel there will be a direct correlation between using expeditious retreat to charge, and the amount you fall to 0.
*made an unusual amount
You summed it up perfectly. I can‚Äôt even say anything else because I have nothing else better to say.
I'm so happy that this worked for you! Go forth, and have unashamed sex in my honour.
By [NAME]! That‚Äôs [NAME] music!
I love how at one point you're following behind her hair watching her dodge a spear
It was good of you to get him out of the store as quickly as possible so he could not infect you with his crazy.
Wait, they banned his mother from travelling too? 
I enjoyed the 1:50 seconds of this person going about their day uneventfully

Mi Patio Mexican restaurant on 7th ave and Osborne. Their chimi is amazing.

im driving and i cant stop screaming i need to talk to someone in sorry
They didn‚Äôt cite a source. On top of the spelling mistakes. It‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt trust infographics for stats.
[NAME] reaction gives me life. His reaction when they got punched last episode was amazing too.
this has been an issue ever since, they already know and don't seem to care
It‚Äôs something put aside in case I really screw up and have no other option but return home
Just scrolling through their sub, they seem to be upset they lost [NAME]. Hope he‚Äôs the right guy for the job
100 chapters of relationship + 50 of build up after [NAME] left [NAME]. Damn you Sasuga T.T

For those wondering: that appears to be a sycamore. It's one of the biggest tree species in the eastern USA.
There will always be an audience for this sort of stuff, look at [NAME]
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
[NAME] just make one shot and we‚Äôll be happy
YES! Here's to us HAPAs!
mvp REALLY cares about your time spent dead and azmo usually doesnt die
Yep i always say this. Absolutely best case scenario is a foul ball. If he puts it in play it's probably a dribbler.
Didn‚Äôt they change his name and give his younger brother his original name? I think they did this is Game of Thrones too.
I‚Äôm feeling very excited !
Wow I got a virus from just looking at this post

Œî sorry I completely forgot about these, but yeah you definitely changed my view 
Wow, way to disregard history completely.

The little ‚Äúyou hurt me so badly but I‚Äôm gonna be brave‚Äù yea... at the end oh my [NAME]. Your friend sucks.
Triple single son
I think I love you mateüòÇ

No, go home
Love is a drug
Awesome job!!
To this day, I get nervous reading anything with [NAME] name in it
I don't even know how to begin explaining something this preposterously self-evident to you, so I'm just not going to. 
Blatant manipulation. Wow!! Who do we report that to?

Honestly I can't see why not. Tho I'm a bi male so I don't know if it's valid haha
But hes still in love with me just not as much as he used to be... and he calls me.
The title of the post started playing this in my head
They are, our cows actually eat grass... and, no corn starch.

Not where I expected that to go...but uh...good luck out there!
Serious on the vacation time, I haven't seen some government workers doing anything for weeks now!
Sometimes, I am amazed that they are able to fit into a car.

The black beans were there hidden within the rice!! :) gotta love those legumes
Plus of course raging at a system that requires that they consider other people (who might even be the dreaded [NAME] or 'foid') as human beings.
Don't like having different stripe profiles on the shoulders to the front of the shirt. One or the other.
Unfortunately half the country are not being reasonable.
When it comes to kids people get irrational. One good snake oil salesmen peddling this garbage can convince people with enough fear.
i know, [NAME] sucks balls
As someone who could totally eat three donuts in a row if I let myself, the amount of sugar this woman consumed still struck terror into my heart
This gives me life
Oh I didnt know the box was stabbed. It kinda looked like they made a little holder for their knife so they could come back to it later.
Anyone else's NHL feed die?

Some of the problems I noticed afterwards, I love the car. The experience not so much. 
Not sure what the point is, apart from illustrating the similarity of ordinary people throughout the world. The interviewee is a fairly normal ignorant bigot.

You armchair analysed it, and were entirely wrong. Literally none of what you said was true, because it was all pretend. 
Last year preseason was in December, but the season started in January. I expect pre-season to occur some time during the second half of this month.
._. yeah, the man is doing something wrong if we feel nothing.
I have a 4.95 rating and it did not go down after tonight's riders. Everybody I drove was a talkative l, drunk and merry group.
OH MY [NAME]
How about making an effort to lose weight?
This is what happens when you don‚Äôt beat up the nerd enough
That's why the OP was proposing a global tax law
April 2018‚Äì so this sub is now all about finding the outrage needles in the haystack, eh? 
Its like a tiny hat. A silly itty bitty hat.
An oldey but a goodey! Phew!
This kind of sacrafice should cost at least 100.000.wanting it for free is what shocks me here most.
It was a few years ago now, I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have it or I would.
‚ÄúHow dare you use your breasts for their biological function instead of my enjoyment!‚Äù
it originated in [NAME], i don't trust them to have any actual grasp on satire.
"""Family is forever""? Weird, I thought humans age and die relatively quickly."
Good question... maybe it has something to do with expanding their international flights? Although if I remember correctly they unload you somewhere else to go through customs.
"Can we change the ""haha"" one to when he was laughing about giving that scarecrow to [NAME] "
TSM would be cool
Zippers. Lots and lots of zippers.
He is already 19, turns 20 in July I think
Wish the blasters were more like BF1
Look! More complaining about people complaining, thus compounding the issue! What a happy little circle-jerk : ) You guys will never stop.
"""Figured you might like to learn something."""
No but I will now. Thanks!
That is the squeal of a kid who gets whatever he wants.
thats one proud daddy!
You gotta block the name out, sweets.
thats some very advanced way of thinking - and I dont think I was able to do that when I was 18
Thanks. I appreciate the candor. I also agree with what you‚Äôre saying.
I think you‚Äôd the one who‚Äôs a stranger to these here parts, *pardner*.
Another rich person to hired for him to be killed.
BP can bulwark counter A good number of deflects and even drop attacks We have more than that to worry about
Good luck don‚Äôt get discouraged you can do it!!!
You're very welcome, and I hope it's the hardest thing you ever have to do--meaning I hope it's all downhill from here. 
I lived across the street from it as a child. Used to swim in it as a kid...Ignorance is bliss.
[NAME] learned to fight smarter, not harder. I love her development so much
Only solves her loneliness though, that kid is not reproducing with anybody. Unless they're not the only ones left on Earth.
It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.
They would call him a snowflake libcuck
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I met up with a woman who was 49. She reminded me of being old. That isn't attractive. Youth makes you feel alive.
I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.
This is really disgusting, the 4x4 community is one of the nicest around, Shame that a few c*nts gotta do shit like this.
He doesn't actually run a 4.49. It's a little deceiving because he's pretty sneaky, so I can understand you being confused.
In that case clench! Clench for all you‚Äôre worth!!
It‚Äôs always about sentience. We already generally restrict abortions about the time fetuses are believed to start feeling pain.
Im sorry I was just trying to help, thank you for educating me ill do better, Happy New year!
Way far down for the usual RVA hype train
What's there to dislike?
I mean it‚Äôs a default subreddit soooo... not really saying much lol
Leave him alone!
It would certainly improve some services (like transit) but would piss off enough people of both cities that I can't imagine anyone proposing it.
....never?
.... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
oh the irony of asking for nudes on a device that can conjure all porn ever conceived at a moment's notice
Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous. I mean I‚Äôm crying about the model but I still spent the money lol
Awesome. Glad to hear it
Oh my god are you [NAME]? If you are I am huge fan. I completed the IX EE earlier today using your guide
Totally agree, but what is Scott's Totts?
Those boots look very warm but I can't imagine wearing them inside. She does look cool though
BASED AND REDPILLED
WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*
My mother did this. This isn't just a millennial thing.
What mental illness am I displaying?
BUT THE HAMBERDERS
I know my imaginary 2 year old knows about the theories of [NAME].
Lol I use an apple charger that‚Äôs split in half to charge mine so I think ur fine
Yeah... I get that. it's like the conversion has already been had before you entered the room and your opinion has been disregarded...
I'm disappointed that this isn't real...
Lucky you got a sane dad. Get ready for a world of crazy... just don't get sucked into her toxic world. Good luck.
Damn I can‚Äôt believe [NAME] beat up [NAME]
What about Governor [NAME]?
Hey, good to see ya here!
Somebody gettin fired
Just being impatient here before the execution information page updates, but if anyone's bought it could you tell me how much health [NAME] new execution gives? 
I personally believe [NAME] is asexual, other characters in simillar situations all get hints toward homosexuality but I can't remember any for [NAME].
Reminds me of this stunt [NAME] pulled a few years ago in
I understand now. Thank you for your thorough explanation.
What did it say? The mods on /r/rant deleted it.
He apparently is staying in DC while being treated, so that's a better sign than some others.
Thank you for your help
It looked sarcastic, you're not in the wrong
Where did you hear this? Sorry I never heard of this and I'm kinda interested now
i wish it was 2 hours :(
Saw this yesterday and it's way funnier with the whole joke spoiled by the /r/bestof title, for sure. 
You can't compare general economic losses to tax funded expenditures. It would only be fair if we lost 5 billion in tax revenue.
I like this new trend
It's when you rock back and forth like an autist or do other repetitive movements because it feels natural to do so.
‚ÄúPerhaps we could share a tray of twinkies together? You‚Äôd love that, *wouldn‚Äôt you*?‚Äù
Cannot confirm i don‚Äôt see any dictatorship yet
No, I'm saying they are equally critical.
I did something along those lines almost 2 years ago and got to 67 upvotes before I got banned
No surprise that the game series is gaining traction!
I brought my love a cherrrryyyyy....
The Dime on Commercial has cheap eats (but expensive drinks) and usually has a good crowd. A bit small but very lively.
Nothing has come close to it well except for GOT.
The more you know
I love [NAME] school of rock
It was understandable, but it was comically basic. He just wanted to take over Earth for Darkseid IIRC. 
this is why the right thinks we can‚Äôt meme
Well damn.
I am just utterly disgusted by it all
[NAME] from HR is drinking again guys..
"I read that as ""It's fat being fucked in the picture"" lmfaoooo"
Like the Whitehouse is getting stale the fuck on now.
You're not going to get anywhere with these kids, mate. Reddit is being astroturfed.
Yep. Id say ever since Diablo 3 it was shown that the company was no more. They no longer were gamers making games for gamers.
Today is the only day I really hate my job as a dog walker
When you've been dodging as much as [NAME] has, to this challenge, ppl start to 2nd guess and lose faith in you.
Sadly my boyfriend's family is the direct opposite but we'll still make it work :3
You got shafted.
I love 4 and 5 just as much as the early seasons. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle; I'm just glad they kept at it.
That would be very cool and a nice non-HP bar visualization.
Don‚Äôt eat snickers on shrooms the taste was so intense and salty I was convinced I‚Äôd thrown up
We have cookies!!!
I‚Äôm just here trying to figure out what trumps head weasel is doing in that picture...
I Am [NAME]!
I moved to the construction industry because it's less mental stress and I can myself better
Bring back [NAME] and [NAME] or Admin 2: Electric Boogaloo will be non existent
> 1 who was asleep [NAME]? Then who was using the phone at 9:20?
I did thank you. Can‚Äôt wait to get back over for some games.
The Vikings....they make me the most angry.
Time goes fast so this 43 years relation must feels like if it was yesterday!
I actually have to try, to see what happens
Wow. He might actually lose Iowa
It's not ok when these people are only partisan in one direction. They have no leftwing equivalent to [NAME].
Good to know everything is about average there. Leave it to H-Town to hold it down.
The parallel to the mistake you're making is so apparent I no longer believe you're discussing this in good faith.
You would be better off to do some makeup tutorials. Save yourself the headache of dealing with hormones that you don't actually need.
No, no, Amazon! Ripping is painful! ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Be *gentle* to your abby wabbies. *Gentle*. *pats you* ‚ù§‚ù§‚ò∫
This was going on for like half an hour. He was drunk and causing trouble, so the tram drivers warned each other not to let him up.
And he's showing off those tiny little hands
They dont mind a second trump term if [NAME] 2020 looks likely
I hope there is a special place in Hell for these people.
sLOVEnian Power! ;)
What country are you in? That makes a big difference for context of advice.
I mean I still attend regular school, this is just a Saturday school. I'm just frustrated that I have to waste Saturday on this
Deal breaks what? You generalized and assumed I am part of the loud vocal minority.
They did this at one of my jobs. The icing on the 'fuck you cake' was the drivers' last day was 4 days before Christmas.
I can see the place where I grew up on here :)
They're both happy though
You haven't responded as to how its not just a parallel analogy, all said was he did
I like that, and the baby laughs at the duck so it makes it cute rather than annoying :)
[NAME] is worse but biden gropes women and little girls
he's interested. maybe text him explaining what you're telling us just more concise
To prep or not to prep, that is thy question.
Thats one way to make political and economic instability sound super fun
Why is it illegal?
Ayyy 6 days !
It‚Äôs like bombs over Baghdad to a whole new level... I LOVE IT!!
Lakers would laugh at that
Thank you for sharing your experience. It adds much needed hope.
I drool over Elijah woods
I never understood why the idea of always swinging pitches served to you on a plate seems radical.
Low effort bait, not even creative or funny.
Oh well, very nice then :)
Hearsay as usual, no proof, [NAME] computer proves he needs help.
I knoooow like why do people exist just to make things worse I‚Äôm so tired of all these alts/ weird question askers
Nor am I as his servant. Though seeing him happy is awesome!
I knooooow. I‚Äôm expecting more water splashes :p [NAME] I was not expecting a manga using the term *girlyboy* to actually be progressive.
Well you‚Äôll have a lot more fun for these matchups. Can‚Äôt say much for the rest of the season
Proper us of cell phone while operating a motor vehicle. Good for you.
And you don't take delight in seeing the person you love in pain. Amen my dear!
Why not Mexico? It is just as close.
I love this contract structure especially since [NAME] is only 31.
Love frank and moody together
I'd hate to see the [NAME] be reduced to a drunk junker. You know, like REYS parents are. 
That‚Äôs great, thanks for the reply and info.
Truth is hate. Men are women.
That‚Äôs the chelsea board will all know and hate.
Jfc, that's depressing.
Peeps poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!
It's time to feel the fucking Bern, America. 
Do you have the car? Why didn't you get copies? What aren't you telling us?
I don‚Äôt know why but watching this makes me super happy!
Thanks Harvard!
I LOVE your glasses! I have the same color but a slightly different shape but yours really suit your face! Also I'm jealous of your hair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Wiggs stop that thing you do with your tongue man.
I wish I would‚Äôve! Idk why I didn‚Äôt record it I think I was just in such shock of what had just happened lol.
His interviews are so awkward
Whoever is against the queen will die.
Thank you for your service
Huge goal for [NAME]. Big confidence boost for the mistakes from the start of the season!
What changed for [NAME]? Last season he had a spurt of being meta and dominant and [NAME] was a bit of a terror
sounds so good bro! but in my case i‚Äôm already out so it feels like it would be a burden to re-coming out... TvT
stay strong!
I make friends not clones.
Now THAT would be an elaborate ruse
This is what I‚Äôve come to expect from this community. Good job
Yeah thankfully I live in mass where it‚Äôs legal here too lol
Is she hot tho
I would like to send you a card or an email for your next birthday if you would want that :)
> But my god, that fucking face. Never mind her, what about him further down.
He can have his opinion, but he doesn't have to state when *no one* asked.
i personally don't think that is true, but thanks for sharing your view on this.
Heya, how would u rate this story? Esp compared to 2 before? ;)
Been living in US for 4 months. Saying obesity is out of hand would be an understatement.
You're welcome. Sometimes we just need a gentle reminder that it's okay to take care of ourselves. You got this.
I did love seeing [NAME] and [NAME] guest on the last episode of the Orville.
The walls are repainted anyway every few years, so if you buy the paint you want, they will even do it for you with that.
Every team is beatable just maybe not by us
[NAME] and [NAME] are friends now.
And they could have kids... yeah sorry. I‚Äôm dumb
I wish that was a thing üòÖ
Has it really been that many games? How time flies when you got nothing to play for.
This actually took me a minute. I underestimate the skill and knowledge of people in this subreddit. Very good.
[NAME] I hate plant thieves. They‚Äôre almost certainly ppl who should know better.
You know a giant lady as a character would be very interesting in my opinion.
I love daydreaming because I daydream about having conversations with people and it is the most pleasing feeling in the world when the conversation happens.
I freakin‚Äô love doing this, too!!! Makes me happy for a second or two!
Which is one of the many reasons it should be paid.
yeah so even after this he got drafted at 41 only lol...and he dominated vs KAT and rest
Start a relaxing bedtime routine. Goggle sleep hygiene and make sure yours is good. Get over your weird thing about reading and try it!
Hey it's [NAME]!
I hope Edmonton gets nuked.
Try to think a bit harder.
To me it‚Äôs sounds like he is trying to find fault in her to make himself feel better about leaving her.
Thank you for your response!
holy lmao im a dolt lol.
I'm not really interested in collecting them but I do enjoy watching videos of people who restore old hotwheels.
Good. Can't wait for the lulz.
It‚Äôs a nice basket.
Oh no, learning a while move set is so much work! But thanks, that's helpful. 
that doesn't make any sense at all.
I don‚Äôt know why but I watch that and just imagine how red barbecue [NAME] would get [NAME] belt out some of those notes
not sure you understand what this sub is for
SHAVE YOUR BEAR
Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise üëç
Wow, my favorite artist and my favorite basketball player. This video is next level üåä
The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It‚Äôs so condescending and creepy.
Good deal, thanks
I think I met you. Sorry if I was a bit standoffish.
I love how this is transgender men not just men üëå
I really wish my husband could get his sleeping disorder under control.
I so badly wish we could all gain this mindset and keep it. How easy would life be.
It‚Äôs amazing what can happen if you work and want to win.
Without these heroes, we could still be counting on [NAME] to fight off opponents, and a collapsing stadium
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ you got the wrong [NAME] ‚Äî
At least you're allowed back in. A bunch of us got mass bumped off and they still wont let any of us know what we actually did
There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate.
You killed them!
Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]
It's awesome. Sorry, I am a red-blooded male. I see a beautiful woman with a thick 10/10 body and I like it. üòé
looks cool, i want it now.
Pretty sure he's a NAVY SEAL IN THE TOP OF HIS CLASS!
There‚Äôs a fairly strong intersection between white supremacists and antivacs from what I‚Äôve noticed
And that is simply why it is (or was) illegal. And why it was classified as a class 1 danger. MONEY.
I'd rather die than drive a Volvo!
Then steal their jets
No I mean live
It's the giant robot penis. Texas favorite.
A fact you know when you've Read the Dictator's Handbook.
Where is [NAME] mentioned in Genesis?
Yeah I wish they hadn't opened the entire game with the ol' [NAME].
She likes life more than I do
You're cool
There are ways to work outside of employment.
I saved up for a top hat recently and it turns out not to fit as I have a large skull. Thanks for your kind words.
Oh, sorry
The worst thing they risk is having to become a worker.
Genuinely, it is! The only complaint is that kentrosaurus is spikey as hell, and I find him with my foot in the dark fairly often...
I guess but i dont see them beating that
well, i mean, he served his sentence and repaid his debt. is his punishment over, or is it forever?
Glad she's not living in a bubble then....
That's not what follows from that at all.
Pure gold!
So Green Bay doesn't get him... I'd be sad for the kid.
Someone should do a ‚Äúwhat posting any related [NAME] romance is like.‚Äù The comments in these posts are a real treat.
The color of it is really cool too
Oh dear lord. Imagine if [NAME] scores off the break from a scoring chance of [NAME] and [NAME]
Hawaiian pizza to the maximum, shout out to Caffe La Via @ Malvern lmao
tfw the blood rushes into your penis
I feel like you and i share a mind. I appreciate your creativity!
Well the good news is once all the boomers die off you won't have any pesky old people to blame anymore.
i was just feeling it okay i knew it wouldn‚Äôt blow up!!!
Oh you're referencing my reply to another comment? I was mad at low effort comments and people who can't comprehend a simple point.
That looks like you need to go to the hospital ASAP or you'll lose a limb and possibly more.
Yikes hope hes ok
Never noticed how unsettling palpatine looked
Not to mention [NAME] screening two defenders haha
"Two supposedly separate accounts created a day apart both misspell ""faggot"" the same way. Same dude confirmed."
True despair.
You are correct. But sometimes you might have a plan or you have to improvise. I‚Äôm glad it worked.
The my bad thing is hilarious.
You're right! I DO remember the refs being trash in that game as well! Thanks for the heads up!
Holy shit. Those guys are scumbags. I'm so sorry you had to go through such an awful roleplay.
"I'm new to polyamory so idk if that's ""normal"" but man it sounds pretty delightful."
You can be a good writer or arguer and be absolutely retarded
‚ÄúJinkies, unmasking the monster is such a pain... Nyeeeeeeeeh~.‚Äù
I already called the county I got married in trying to find out about it but they had nothing on either of us about a divorce.. Im so anxious.
Handing a dead kid back to the parents and hoping they won't notice before you can high tail it. That's a bold move [NAME].
Weird! Also in Winnipeg, no issues. Do you have a VPN?
Ah yes, the romantic concept of a meal in bed.
> ships will accept it for transportation The requirement isn't for transportation, it is to use it as a transportation fuel. 
> I doubt a typical [NAME] would be bankrupted by a $20K bill This attitude represents exactly the stereotype of [NAME] that most people have.
That sounds fun. I think I can make it. I have tickets already. I‚Äôm excited to see [NAME] play as well.
Glucose guardian!!!! Salmonblue, you are doing amazing sweetie.
OC, my friend...They May circle back. [NAME] will have complete control in TB. 
I just wanted my knees to stop hurting
I fully endorse the oppression and eventual extermination of all gamers.
I knew this was coming! Amazing!
Lol. My gamer tag is the same as on here if you ever want to squad up and play man
I cant decide if replacing it with an icecream cone would make it better or worse or incredibly worse and also cursed
Excellent collage, I learned so much from all these guys. The community is great, the unconfiscatable conference was awesome üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
Can‚Äôt go in with that mindset though. We all deserve a fair trial and to be judged by a jury of our peers.
My new favorite phrase.
i dont think you guys understand it at all tbh.
Lol, and be sure to slam the door real hard when you leave.
Yeah. If they actually tested their patch, they would've found out about these things.
Wow fuk I'm watching that right now
Oops, my apologies! I should‚Äôve included this in reference to [NAME] taking her to court for the child support.
Okay I can see this looking really cool for a festival or photos though üòÑ
I love that idea!! And the homework is almost always work that wasnt finished in class. None of her teachers assign homework unless its a project.
But I was told that sub was for civil discussion!!!
Funny how the [NAME] leaves the most important item out of their article headline.
I feel a deep sense of shame.
It isn't only a representation of the economy, but how poor most people's financial sense and budgeting skills are.
Bro, this is not what this sub is for.
Sometimes you gotta agree with the terrible Facebook memes.
I hope she makes enough for therapy for her kid.
No seriously, why do you have the Daily Mail app on your phone?
And that smilie she gave the fianc√© when he sat down with the sandwich....I would be scared if I was him.
Don't see how this video means I need sex? Also, this isn't my video. Try OP.
I mean she's a capitalist too. Not saying the accusations aren't rooted in sexism but like how about we just stop having rich people...
That's right, always be extra careful around the corner.
Lmao is he wearing knockoff Bulls shorts with a Lakers jersey
This keeps getting posted. I think not
May we all strive to be like that man.
[NAME]. I just want you to have a great stat day.
This scene was priceless! Trash TV gold.
You monster, I hate it. Well played.
Canada is also getting news coverage.
"Danish PM on the topic - ""We are not Socialist"""
Anybody that puts that many numbers in their handle is an obvious psychopath.
Well the nips are definitely going to be making a showing, so either be comfortable with that or get some pasties.
Needs a real big bag of rice!
Get more crushes.
Thanks mate. It's just a process now. Fingers crossed that time will heal all (or most) wounds!
The post in this screenshot and your comment shows how fragile you guys really are.
He's a alt right MAGA idiot.
it's only soft cause you can't make it hard
Lol the ‚Äúlower levels‚Äù. Very cute
I love it. Probably my favorite game mode right now. Especially when playing with a buddy.
Well that makes it easy. Thanks again. I'll look into it.
can you share it here? I would love to be able to support you and watch your success!
I hate my life
To be fair he did apologize for that one after he learned what Pride was really about but I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend going near his Twitter anymore
Inkling main: I like being cheap. It makes me happy.
Nice try OSI
"Thanks for the tip! You get bonus points for no spelling mistakes. If I can offer a tip in return, look up what ""ironic"" means."
Only [NAME], their deputy leader, their most experienced minister....remember there was evidence she assaulted a staffer and kept her job as a MP...
Source? üòÇ
He didn't see him and afterwards tried to high five him but [NAME] was walking away
Ah yeah Pawnstars is History. A&E is Storage Wars
> People who aren‚Äôt stupid don‚Äôt get offended when Called stupid. Exactly. Well put. Thanks.
Can‚Äôt really do much about it since our only other ball handler available today is Napier
America can out-lazy your ass any day.
You bomb them and they come your way 'cause you're a real winner!/s
Such a shame. Her butt was pert, cute and perfect in her Vogue days. Yes, I am showing my age.
That's the highest resolution version of that I've seen.
Glad to hear it :)
He‚Äôs had big games for us before, it‚Äôs just his lack of consistency and effort 
Another senseless tragedy.
Ahh. I forgot that was a thing with large breeds.
i just was disapointed because [NAME] wont have the chance to play with the GOAT. i didnt mean to smh to your comment
As well as this, tell others about your classes AND schedule. Your Fe might be weak but it still makes you do stuff.
If by probe you mean ‚Äúask questions‚Äù then it‚Äôs To fully understand what you‚Äôre trying to say ‚Äî why else?
Revolver is pretty beast tho, 2 shot close range
Fucking pouliot you're shit
Partywolf had 178 losses in a row? Are you seeious? I can't believe that
I remember being a kid, 5-9 years old range, and constantly being subjected to this line when my mother ran errands. This is so dead on. 
Man, I can‚Äôt believe we traded all that and didn‚Äôt even get a top 10 guy
I‚Äôm proud of you and I‚Äôm happy for you!
There is no excess. Everybody gets what they agreed upon. Fake news.
Glad *you* find it funny!! You've ruined my morning!!
But how does he.....but where will he......can he even........fuck it I‚Äôm out
Oh [NAME]....
Your loss. [NAME] is an excellent chef, and all of his restaurants are amazing.
While an interesting idea I'd rather have scepter be more like it is in DotA and upgrade the passive and/or signature card.
[NAME] IS SO OLD HIS FAVORITE ROUTES ARE TO THE CVS AND CRACKER BARREL.
This was a hate crime. Cut and dried.
I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.
Damn, you could make money out of this. Come people I'm Intj, i'll tell you if your ex still loves you. 
Well, only the ones who don't reoffend anyways.
You have just given a face(?) to my phobia
If I get another dog imma name it after a [NAME] song SO FUCKING CUUUUTE
Oh wow, you are strong did you report him?
Pretty shit tbh with you
BCH has mostly stopped doing this too. No one who matters fell for it.
I fail to see the downside of that.
And this is what they look like when they are grown up...
Thanks for the info and the welcome! Blue and Orange forever!
I think that‚Äôs accurate. The probably I think means maybe will get a set
Ah so basically SDS is saying they're officially done with 18. Does the event never end
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not a military man
Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can‚Äôt afford to watch anymore of them.
Love this man, take my updoot.
Absolutely... pretty ridiculous dt. I‚Äôm in [NAME]
Damn have they not heard of shelters. Bro go adopt a pupper.
There‚Äôs a fine line between love and hate, you know. 
Now we need [NAME] to reunite with [NAME]
Not anymore, haven't heard of him in ages.
Ah yes, the true third gender. 
Hey man skol vikings. Support however you‚Äôd like, just as long as you support 
Just search her in this group you will find tons of info to see why people think that. I don‚Äôt have time to type everything out
See you all tomorrow for FIN - USA! End of the evening iguana
That‚Äôs scary
Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters
I can definitely relate, but I haven‚Äôt yet resigned myself to such a fate. Maybe I a few more years....
I don‚Äôt believe that. They already said the [NAME] aren‚Äôt coming back and your choices in Season 3 don‚Äôt matter.
Just like that he quit. Maybe he didn't think it was worth the hassle/risk of fighting that for a one night, four hour show
Doesn‚Äôt excuse the majority of southerners
Yes, that‚Äôs pretty much it ! Thank you, I will, it‚Äôll just be a week or so before I get there. 
That was such a good cast. Loved that year.
I can help out, pm me :)
That sounds really helpful, thanks so much
Maybe you were depressed because your place was a mess.
And NO DOGS sign. This is perfect.
by the time I found it was a delay it was too late to go back to bed but I didn't have enough time to do anything fun
Grandmother got into an accident many years ago, and walked away with broken ribs.... it took her a couple years before she found out
I love how they keep getting smaller üôä
I just see two inflated peacocks with a dumb and disgusting look in their face. But unfortunately I am not the gender evaluating them.
Their Core album is. Literally the 1st genre listed on Wikipedia is grunge lol
Hate to break this to ya but you are that guy [NAME]

Didn't he write a dissertation about the pros and cons of finishing college instead of going into MLB?
Nelsinho!!
But really though, it really contextualizes how bad this coaching search has been that the Rams' QB coach is the only guy we can be optimistic about
Woohoo! He is motivated and awesome!

Stay strong dude
People can't afford my products, i'm not selling anything. Issue for the producer to reduce price
You are wrong but people shouldn‚Äôt downvote you for that. Downvoting people for trying to become more informed is what leads to an ignorant community.
I like Kyber
I'll make a note of this. Thanks!
i freaking love five below! Wait no nevermind
You be honest with her and you break up with her. At that point her decisions are her own.
No! You can't have that one! That's a coconut cake!
Well if T_D users like Coolio, maybe they ain't so bad after all. 
Great to see him involved.
I haven't defended trump whatsoever, you're completely missing my point
I love democracy.
Oh no, her eyebrows
I think thats the point, this screams irony. Like r/comedyheaven brand
The old bear
Give an example of one with an entirely different meaning please. The context of what you mean by different is lacking.
The man and dog have been spotted running past [NAME] and nobody is helping! I would help but I just had my nails done.
But he did...at the end of last year and this season.... And I‚Äôll take Mayfields word over speculation
what a beta!
I'm skeptical a single opinion would change. Politics is so polarized anyone who would bother to listen already made up their mind.
Wow good on you! I hope to have similar progress this year. How‚Äôd you do it?
She‚Äôs the sister of the [NAME] that killed [NAME] brother!
I thought the joke was going to be that there would be a kiwi (fruit), but this is way more wholesome

Your just killing time now.
Would be nice.
This r/dbdgonewild/
That‚Äôs depressing
And even worse after 40 years!
At first I thought that dude was shooting the guy between the cars :o
who tf is the middle guy? [NAME] is supposed to have sunglasses and a clown car like in FE6
Oats have proteins similar enough to gluten (avenins) that they can actually cause problems for some people with ceiliacs. Maybe that'd work.
Adorable little buggers.
Ya like I said. Depends on my tup sitch
As a fellow shuffle/jamskater this makes me really happy lol.
Ah true blue love
I slept so great last night uwu More wins vs them please!
I'm not in the loop of this storyline as college has consumed whatever free time I have, so can you explain this to me please
I better not screw this up..
Wow. Imagine being this stupid. Life must be so hard for you.

Sending you some Ramona wine as thanks!
Yeah I know u irl you look like ur 36.
No. Foreigners are not allowed to preach [RELIGION] to [NAME]. Maybe not explicitly . Also They restrict donations from abroad Not just people.
In her defense it‚Äôs like 20 something degrees in Indiana right now
Aww, what a cute pair
But if I want the objective control how do I go about it in the early game where respawn are fast?
If we're talking about the person in the middle, that's a man. [NAME]. 
thanks for the recap
Shit, with a full season of [NAME] on the docket? Yes please.
Except people have been yelling about climate change for decades, it‚Äôs just that finally a prominent politician has made it their main point.
It‚Äôs fitting. All things Considered.

Okay cool. Gonna drive home from the hospital.

Chattel slavery is uniquely different from other types of forced labour and indenture.

Kudos to OP for not falling for the bait.
Good for you, maybe some day you'll come to an understanding of each other but familiarity breeds contempt.
I daydream about putting them on. I let other people daydream about the taking them off part.

Let's get the streak going.
Look at this [NAME].
They're not going to read their UserVoice anyways. It's a PR stunt.
that's fine also someone who shit their pants of realization
The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you‚Äôre feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
love this! makes me want to go hiking at superstition this weekend.
So I should definitely give up on real life is what you are trying to say huh? :(
Yeah totally not trapped by belt and road /s
I for one am happy for [NAME] ballin out. Now let's go win this game !!!!
[NAME] lost her guitar canonically
I just don't know whether to believe if this is achieveable at this age.
I'm curious though, will they upvote it to own the ~~libs~~ [NAME]?
Oof, thanks
I'm flattered but I'm a good [RELIGION] scarf
I have seen strangers get into fights over one of them cat calling some woman.
Clearly there is only one way to solve this dilemma; COMMUNISM!
Thanks nate. If you need any help any time or support I'm here for ya.
Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
True. I'm just glad I didn't have to go through my high school years we the her...

Man I jave never heard such a load of horseshit.
No, princess, your body works the same way as everyone else's... You are not a mystery of physics. 
You know you could replace republican with democratic and it would still be funny
Just a reminder that Ayr vs Talbot is on BBC One at 12pm. Or get it on now, [NAME] is making some lovely looking quesadillas 
Thank you! You're right. It's all about survival
It's kinda funny when it's told to you
I‚Äôm thinking so, since the sides are spiky and somewhat serrated.
Then you're awfully worked up over people seeing the world differently

Somebody reverse this please I would be so happy.
[NAME] damn you're toxic asf
Oh, thx for clarification!
Thanks [NAME]!
Never thought I‚Äôd see a comrade here
You are saying toxic people try to be the victim by calling you toxic.
I can when enough time has passed. I've got each of their playoff games from that year and it's fun to relive it during the offseason.
There is no way that happened, dialogue is too coherent to be Scottish.

Luckily they were on the phone texting, which saved them from panicking/noticing.
Glad to hear it. Love Rapid City.
Ugh the fans smh

Until you tell someone and they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúWhoa [NAME] that‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù
You do eat off them in very special situations
Great movie. Great TV show. Simply perfection.
I don't need to tell you how you're a paranoid conspiracy theorist you are doing an awesome job of that already!
Love it yeet
Ain't that the truth, lol
Everyone including an ambassador has freedom of speech. Get an education.
Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
I'm hoping he's just gonna psyche people out like [NAME] did with [NAME].
Im so glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals instead of being on my nokia
You replied to a bot that quotes a movie.
Wait, how do u know he is a therapist
So, where we at on this? 
US postal service right? Might have something to do with the government shutdown, but I‚Äôm not sure.

Sorry. Bad day.
Hope you feel better soon. Probably won't happen, but good feeelings sent your way.
Go get one of those interest free loans provided by banks, you basically get your check just with extra steps.
Cue [NAME] and his rant on old American men
I‚Äôll bet the Phillies owner had a beer with [NAME] high school baseball coach.
Got my attention.
Yes...it would be weird, but at the same time there are immigrant families without citizenship or working toward getting citizenship.
Interesting to see Dashy and Crimsix change specialists. And Scump is running Stock 2 on his Saug. Seems like they are trying some new things.

I reported an old man for terrible driving and the police actually took it seriously (pleasantly surprised). It's worth a try!
I can only download games using SteamCMD at work at the moment, so yeah, glad I could buy it before the shutdown
You‚Äôre right, I have come across that as well. I have been driving long distances for too long! Congratulations on a shorter drive! 
You think that hearing deathcries is **funny** ? Personally, hearing cries of pain and dispair don't cause me enjoyment, but I guess I'm a weirdo.

The Iowa State Cyclones are my favorite college basketball team.
I don't mean at Blizzcon but shortly after, like a week, imo that would have been for the best for the players and everyone involved
Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives.

Sometimes it‚Äôs annoying but I think it‚Äôs at an okay place right now
Majority of [NAME] support Dem investigations of a foreign agent? I‚Äôm so proud!
Oh I know. [RELIGION] is the most severe form of brainwashing on the planet. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing like it. It blows my mind.
And that‚Äôs assuming all your organs are in good condition, if you smoke or drink heavily you are likely losing lots of value.
As someone else has mentioned it is not theft technically. So that will probably only cause more problems for myself.
That was jarring indeed. But why he wearing a mask?!?!?!

Fuck this boring ass 9-5 corporate bullshit. I feel like starting a podcast about the Bulls.
Simon's or the bay. [NAME] makes some merino ones that are unbelievable. They are not cheap though.
Well he is saying the right sort of things. I'm glad [NAME] won but I'd like to see [NAME] come back well.
I'm not looking forward to mine. Need to just do them though. I spent a lot last year on medical bills so hoping the deduction helps.

Coincidence..only 2 hours ago I opened a roll of US quarters Ive had for a few months..16 regular pcs...and 24 states quarters. 24..quite happy.
[NAME] isn't advocating socialism. He's advocating the government intervene in the labor market because those mean free marketers. Not [NAME] but populist left
But then they couldn't be a self-martyring, violent tankie and that's not as much fun.

I'd love if Sony use [NAME] as [NAME] in a Venom movie. I want [NAME]
Oop my bad
I'd be able to give you more helpful advice if you could be a little more clear with your situation and what you're asking.
Here Also have no idea but I think I'd prefer their attraction over any other race
"The 5 days got an audible ""[NAME]"" out of me. That's terrifying. "
For me it is unwatchable after the greatness of the LD seasons.
I miss those days.
Happy cake day
Also it looks like this person might have a mustache. They look like they shaved their upper lip kind of mustache. I'm very confused.
Do you want to see a picture of my diploma
Judging by my 10 month old, that is about 2.5 days worth of dirty diapers. 
That really generalized my political enemys.
Support this cause please. It saves lives
Oh man! Oh boy!
Did you heretics
I thought [NAME] was awesome tonight. That kid is passing on another level. I'd love to see that kid saucing up [NAME] on the PP unit
It just feels like everything is so false. If I can't care about myself why would anyone else.
[NAME]. I'm not kidding.
I really need to put my foot down. Thanks for the gentle nudge :)
THIS!!
What about, hear me out now, 2max? It doesn't sound cool though. Could probably call it something else.
It's viewed as unfashionable and lower class. Personally I think they feel great. Who gives a shit what other people think?
You miss the sidewalk wing massacres as well I'd bet
Hey guys don't freak out but Widow has a POISON MINE, ikr I never knew it existed. I was too busy missing body shots.
That is the plan.

I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation.
You're gullible enough to believe them.

Limiting the crypto withdrawl increases the panic
Exactly[NAME] is refusing to acknowledge that his romantic relationship, as formed, is over and to move on. OP, you're incompatible.
Got to study somehow.
Mom used to do it all time when I was a kid.
Congrats. Having a steady job (and one that I actually enjoy somewhat) is the #1 thing that helped me out with depression/anxiety.
Stay away from her kids, [NAME]!
[NAME] unborn grandchildren disliked that.
Ahhh okay my bad I misread your comment, I thought you meant we‚Äôd be trading him if he plays poorly 
Even if this was true who would want to take medication that causes such rapid mood swings
I'M A FIVE STAR MAN!!! *as [NAME] clicks one star over and over
It‚Äôs amazing.
Oh man I feel bad now. If you find it funny than it's funny üíñ sorry
[NAME] needs to slow things down there.. ffs
Its not gonna happen.
Excelerate are looking really good yo. They've outslayed every map, are executing perfect plays. Fun, playing to their full potential.
She is using you for money. You already lost her
Take a seat young ragewalker.
That isn't in the rule.
Oh no way is it miners, it's blockstream fault they bought every developer that had commit access to bitcoin's repository. End of story.
‚ÄúI got five on it‚Äù for the movie US is decent as well. They made it so creepy.
You are an absolute gem
Happy New Year! Looks like you had a great time there! Cheers! Here‚Äôs to a great 2019 hopefully in both baseball and life!
Top female players including [NAME] practice against college men players and get beat a lot by them. I wouldn't be suprised to see [NAME] win even at 14..
This has been going on for months and bypass 2018 and now it is about to end.Actually I doubt it
Are you claiming that the entire biology and geology communities have been lying for centuries?
we love critical impactful discourse
I thought CLA mixed rumors.
Isn't the minimum 3 majors or something? I don't think he made the cut but I'd be happy to be proven wrong
> They are working on something new... TLWGAS. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm too dumb to figure out what that stands for
This is good. Thank you!
! good bot
"INFJ hands down ""Being organised brings joy to me"""
Not true at all
I'm stealing the tv tonight to watch the [NAME] tapes. He hates serial killer stuff
Nope, it‚Äôs love. 
Ghostbusters 2: ghost-bustier ?
Meh, it‚Äôs ‚Äúnext man up‚Äù over there. I‚Äôll be worried when they stop making it to the playoffs. 
Yeah more and more I play BFV I just find myself wishing this thing or that thing was more like the old BF‚Äôs.
I just wish he got more screen time. Im enjoying this season but I feel like the huge cast of side characters get all the attention.
You're right... But look at that badass black leather jacket.
What are the Four Agreements?
When it's the same composer, this kind of thing is bound to happen.
This isn‚Äôt unpopular. Like 1 in 15 people actually think this... go say this shit in another sub
This is a guide to all major religions and their stance on vaccines.
Part of me want to see the rest but the other part of me realises he's probably cold
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd have a problem with [NAME] getting his head stomped into a kerb.
I like Tom and Kato.
But but [NAME] and his bad postseason stats
The best story I've read this year!!
[NAME] and [NAME] did alright together. They were both disappointed with the outcome (initially at least) but Under Pressure was a huge hit.
That's a great song
I hate it too. But I will....
i was leaving areal comments not pormotions but acctually i was leaving many
My god, [NAME]!
Damn, sorry to hear that. Hopefully the right gig will come along!
Wow very impressive table! Side note, it's [NAME], not ei
Are you okay?
N00b account tosses insults - how surprising.
Oh my goodness.....I'm sorry. It's probably gonna take a long time to cope it.....
When they say shoot your shot that‚Äôs not what they meant
Imagine watching yourself back and still being unable to see why you were eliminated
That right hand sent our dad flying across the cage. Lol
"""I shouldn't have done that, it's not the honorable way."""
Unfortunately on my end, it‚Äôs only pecks during sex. Pretty boring. Never open mouthed or anything like that. 
Except for the part where [NAME] Millennial daughter is one of the big new heroes introduced in MKX...
Come to Louisiana! Gas stations have single 16oz‚Äôs on ice and we have drive through daiquiris.
"Verify yourself already or we will continue to ""spit negativity"""
I'm hoping it will pass but I do know you may be correct. I'm just not sure what to do.
The part that shocks me is that they allowed him to wear shorts in regular class.
I love people watching from the balcony here
My boyfriend is so much like your husband. I‚Äôm so happy for you to have him, he sounds wonderful. 
I do watch legends and lol yes we all know she existed/originated in the future. I also know that this is a different [NAME] from the [NAME].
I hope they appreciate the fact someone is getting up earlier than them in order for this to all work. I appreciate you, and I'm unemployed.
Your link won't load and are you seriously citing fucking Syria as a successful example of anything? [NAME] holy motherfucking pecker.
[NAME] dumb friends wanted him with the little baddie. and now he's gonna end up back in jail. Oh [NAME] I love [NAME].
That makes me super hesitant. I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if we end up with him but the last thing this team needs is raw players.
I have this too, so don't worry. We are not crazy. Just regular humans who happen to have an anxiety issue. 
I love how they added a camouflage hat on the australian dude for no reason at all
I saw your missing post and hoped you found your baby! I'm sorry for your heartache
>It's for this reason I'm hoping to leave. Where to if you don't mind me asking?
[NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you
As a high libido female, I feel the same with posts from males. It's slightly relieving to know someone else struggles the same way.
What a dream
That's the theme of this excellent play:
Sacrifice them to [NAME]
[NAME] is so fun. You can cc everyone and be annoying af. Imo [NAME] is the most fun role ü§∑
If the kids are in sports activities you can chat up the other parents.
Hawaiian shaved ice is THE BEST!!!!
Just next her. She'll never find a SD anyway, she's all talk.
Yep. I'm glad I never did. I'll gladly use their service for free when it suits me and give them nothing in return
But did you see my friend sent me a picture of [NAME] trying to tell me he's having a baby
I have to agree- amazon is hardcore. They'll permanently ban you without warning, for things that someone else fabricated. Or so I've heard.
Oh man, you got me there with the image
Wow these are amazing
No you pick a different hero. Aint fkn rocket science.
My understanding it was a simply banking error
Not complain. She could not complain since she made no effort in the beginning.
This looks sick
Carlton back to back wooden spooners. Champions of the bottom.. :)
Thanks for the reply! May I ask what part of the world you're from?
I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this.
[NAME] and [NAME] are playing scared today.
No worries. We just like to make sure everyone is safe and has a voice.
 Now, can you make another applet to change his wallpaper?
I used to love to mix addys and Valium 10s though lol!
so proud of you!
Pretty sure they claimed he resisted arrest. If I remember correctly he was just peacefully sitting on the curb when the cops decided he was resisting.
Hahahahahahaha give me a piece of that kit Kat bar
It's not the best hockey but the boys have regrouped nicely after that horrible game in Edmonton
This is the kind of relationship i want to have,a warm soothing one.... 
I am so very sorry that you are dealing with all of this
Never thought of that. Now i dislike Heaven more than before.
Hah, much appreciated! :)
The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo.
Not actually cheating if the system is set up that way. Take it up with your Government.
Post this to /r/MurderedByWords I legit wanna see the teeth mashing
How do they know how tall you are while your sitting in your car. Such bullshit.
"""I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself."" Thank you [NAME]. "
i meant what i said.
I prefer to pay for my hugs, higher quality.
"This is a ""lose in the 11th round of the shootout"" type game"
Habs-Flames has always been my dream final. Right our last wrong.
Technically not r/politics. Wasn‚Äôt expecting this result from r/showerthoughts.
Wish you the best of luck and greener pastures!
You could say this situation got a little hairy
Last year was our worst defensive performance since 1995 and the manager lost his job as a result. It shouldn't take much to give even a slight improvement
suck me beautiful
They can‚Äôt ask for much, hes on his last year, it‚Äôs similar to us and [NAME]
you can be sweet
only took em all of the time to realize
1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now‚Äôs not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
Welcome back you two lol
What a snake. Typical Fort Mcmurray politics.
daaaaaamn girl!
Our mod is an awesome mod
Wait so his eyes don't work? Then how does he put his penis in your vagina?
It starts with the malicious ones and then they whip up the others. [NAME] is truly a stain on american politics.
for full video
It‚Äôs up to you to fight it in court if you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. And your word versus his.
I would have thrown them out sooner for all of the childish things they did.
For sure. I am infatuated with sharks, and much of that obsession comes from absolute fear haha. 
SHE AIN'T NO DEMON!
May your test be negative and your New Year's be happy!
These damn kids with their Rage Against the Machine and their nae-naeing.
Certainly not haha
He had a bad year the year prior to [NAME] coming, yes. 2 years prior to [NAME] he had 30 TD and 17 INT. 
[NAME] article the other day was below contempt. Don't know what I expected tbh.
That's a curious thought, the science of our worries. Does that fall under psychology? Btw, fun pic on your profile!
Ironically it‚Äôs [NAME] and his family that are the whiny crybabies in this case based on your criteria
At this point all you can do is put full faith in the man. Let him get creative
Ha ha?
Yup, it all starts with [NAME]. He‚Äôs not the worst owner in the nfl, but he‚Äôs in the bottom half for sure. 
Too little too late! [NAME] is guilty of still making songs with [NAME].....
Ahh well too bad, thanks for sharing. 
Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here and you can still do amazing things.‚Äù
Kinda reminds me of that pluto pic from nasa
oh my [NAME] the hands... so small... but so powerful...
Shame [NAME] is no longer with us
[NAME] looked like he was having a heart attack the entire game... welcome to the madhouse lol
He‚Äôs still a handsome fella, imo. ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
don‚Äôt show the FDA /s
"""Everyone knows the [NAME] make good stuff!"" - Sham-Wow guy. "
Oh, what a tangled web we weave When first we practise to deceive!
"Sorry i was thinking of the word ""Plaintiff"""
You are the smiley face killer
I like how you're insinuating that the other half is family reunification rather than giving us the real answer.
How have [NAME] and [NAME] looked tonight? I was watching the Huskies game during the first period.
[NAME] damn it [NAME]!
I see you missed the announcement. [NAME] tweeted a teaser.
I thought sex would be a great stress reliever.
Thanks so much! I'll let you know how it goes when I get a chance to try it :)
If the cops arrested him, he must be guilty! (Good luck!! You got this!)
For me it's New York City FC since it's just a train ride away
Yes! My Big Fat Fabulous Life
If he breathes he‚Äôs ready!
Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.
That's unfortunate for you.
It's definitely not that simple mate! It would be nice if it were. Where's the part about inflating your way out of trouble for example?
Not any weirder than male doctors handling women junk for centuries.
Facechat. Fax. Oh mama
I mean, he's 6'0''. He just isn't thicc
This is the big one. If he gets away with this he'll get away with anything. People need to do what it takes to prevent this
"Just a benign comment on an interpretation of ""Annihilation"" movie plot. Reaction just came out of nowhere"
Too bad [NAME] is going to be completely overshadowed by [NAME] to even notice.
This will forever be my most fav April moment!
Omg i love you hahahahgaha
80k/month? Damn. I need to become a Union Square store
This is the most Boomer thing i've ever seen
Lol what do you mean ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
For those behind stupid WaPo
No clue, all I know is that Shia [NAME] hit themselves for some reason 
They fetishize our oppression. Different day, same tune. 
Oh no!
Buddy you are mad online right now. Take a deep breath or a Xanax
The very worst possible route they could have gone.
my gawd! This is adorable!
All the game modes are super fun
I had a crush on this guy ever since I saw him as the mad hatter on OUAT.
As an [NAME], I apologize for the cranky old conservatives who are probably making ridiculously uninformed comments about your country right now :/
I guess that depends on the department. If you've racked up a ton of vacay time, it's possible for some cops to smoke weed lol.
I love my state sometimes
Say it with me! S! A! T! I! R! E! What does that spell? SATIRE!!!
Wow, sorry, bruh. I didn‚Äôt realize we were in the presence of genius. Please elaborate.
[NAME] went form 4-12 to 11-5 when he switched teams. Coaching success does not necessarily regress with age. Athletic ability does. That's the difference.
Breathing out like a dragon keeps me from gagging when i brush the back of my tongue
This would be boring as hell
I think the show was all about forgiveness. She can't change [NAME] and fighting with him only brings him around and brings her pain.
‚Äú[NAME], have we got an offer for you!‚Äù
Okay combine these ideas and make a montage that's mostly laughing with coughing clips thrown in.
I stopped worrying about showing vulnerability years ago but there's still nobody there.
And in the case of human trafficking, these people we should be given homes and protection instead of being tossed out to be abused in their home country
"""Someone else must start this however... but I will sure join in the violent fight that will ensue... I promise!"""
Damn. Alright.
I just cant imagine someone insulting a guy by comparing him to one of the most successfull child actors. (I know who [NAME] is)
A crappy situation... Man oh man...
Yes it is I‚Äôm 99.9% sure! Thank you! Enjoy your gold.
And what I really want is to have time only for myself, without wasting it at work
it's a good thing they had a screen protector on it
Is that what this is? I thought it was some kind of a tattoo gun.
Ummm... I think you mean this beauty.
wait. So most of south asia doesn't eat rice?
Oh god. The pages are still Packers though, right?!
I love Crimson Skies.... That's a completely fucked thing to do.
He looks fine. So does that 1911. He's just holding his girl's purse while she rummages through stuff. She's right next to him.
Do y‚Äôall consider Cadillacs as ‚Äúluxury‚Äù cars similar to Audis, BMW, Lexus ?
I feel like this is gatekeeping the gatekeepers .... No more elites = no more gatekeepers
Maybe people just don‚Äôt like it?
That was because he played nearly a third of the year in CF.
pretty fukkin sure lmao, its over fam, doing another trumpdown would kill the gop so they wont let him do it
"""Do we need a GoFundMe for automated doors"" hahahah!"
So THIS is what it's like to have a seizure when listening to self control...
That's ruis intentions
I love how he‚Äôs still smiling while being eaten
That makes it an extra special accomplishment. Yay!
Yay, now we're only down by 7
They mean staged. This video is portrayed as a real occurrence. It might be, might not be. Don't really care.
I‚Äôve been abused enough by the Knicks today.
How delightful it is that it truly could apply to multiple moms
Most rapists aren't, unfortunately. 
god damn this is some major league pathos
Remindme! 243 days
Rainy weather must have gotten them... no idea. But i've never seen a dead hummingbird and saw 2 within 5 feet of each other :(
I miss [NAME]
She looks like an onion
For everyone who was wondering: dude is picked up, can move his legs and says ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs ok‚Äù.
Oooooooo, definitely agree on [NAME].
I hope xe had a nice talk with the premier
12 year old self wouldn‚Äôt understand how I put a pint of ice cream back in the fridge. It should be finished.
They do a great job until one pops free and smacks you in your junk.
Get the hell out! I will need to rewind this. Held her hand?? That‚Äôs scandalous.
If you main Volibear, then you must have Thunderlord Voli and play Thunderstruck by AC/DC every now and then at full volume.
I certainly got what I asked for. Thanks. DI mixups are so cool.
Man I thought [NAME] was going to be the real deal. I wanted [NAME] gone so bad around that time.
That‚Äôs awesome.
Wow this is the first I‚Äôve heard of this. You should go tell /r/hockey, I‚Äôm sure they have no idea either.
I think we should get married
How was she able to start the adoption process without both you and BF consent plus signatures?
Ok thank you
"The weird part of our ""rivalry"" is that some people bought into it."
Everyone makes the NREMT test sound like the devil. It really isn't that bad.
I feel like one day you're in for the shock of your life.
With punctuation like that I'm surprised you're not from Jordanhill
CNN has video of the arrest. Someone needs to put the cops theme over it.
Yep. Lots of younger generation are obsessed with their phones and emotionally rocky tend to engage in this behavior, especially women with their whole Instagram obsessions.
inertial frame of reference is the viewing party.
You mean morons??
the hate we get in here is palpable.
Oooo thanks! Hopefully I‚Äôll be home from work by then!
they dont pay shit
Yesterday. All my troubles seemed so faaar away. Now it looks though that they're here to stay. Oh I believe, in yesterday. 
i discourage a protest that tried to infringe upon free speech
Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of her aligning with those people. 
Good luck and Godspeed.
General population are scared of press
just end the friendship and go meet more people. You're just prolonging the obvious.
Yayyy!!! Go little green bean go!!! Good job trainer!!
This guy also has scorching speed on the bases.
Seek help.
[NAME] is as intellectually dishonest and stupid as people like [NAME] and [NAME] of Akhad. He‚Äôs just a chameleon who‚Äôs clueless.
> the dems caused the shutdown, Uh they did. They're the ones who won't agree to the wall. 
it always depends on person and dosage. get products with only dex youll thank yourself for it.
Locking a bunch in a kids in a room with their pedophile priest is fun af? You need help.
Oh you'd prefer if I used this pic instead? I understand.
Sounds good.
Isn't it the same thing? Or at least equally bad?
I love [NAME]. I hope she can hold on in 2020.
Seriously? That‚Äôs so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these ‚Äúfans‚Äù are disgusting.
Ok well I hate to break it to you but I'm a magical pink unicorn...posting something on the internet does not make it true
they sounds like autistic meltdowns triggered by an immense fear of vomiting, nothing much to do
No I didn't. PM me your username here and I'll reach out to you.
Ok sure that‚Äôs a nice unfounded opinion you‚Äôve got there. Unless you‚Äôve been in one in which case wow sorry
Meow-meow smiles upon all of this.
Granted, I dont have a proper measure of the number of monkeys needed to hash $0.05 worth of tx fees.
Yup, it was a complete waste of time.
This guy is wrong. Yes, most illegals do pay taxes and generally rely less on government help than native citizens.
Looks like Russian agitprop is pivoting to Tulsi. [NAME] can kiss his chances for 2020 goodbye.
ATM has scored only 27 goals in 19 games and have 38 points from it, frankly really outrageous. They keep shithousing a win.
Where have I seen this before? Oh [NAME].
Wonderful :D, she looks like [NAME] from Frozen, or [NAME] form Dota 2. Great job!
The numbers in my head were (-90,-120). Upon closer inspection, yours are closer. Those two are added together for Total Points Added, no?
I know right put all her effort on the costume and her body
And for pro-Syrian-rebel tweeting (which means anti-Western leftists): [NAME]
Is that not with mice though? I could be wrong or maybe its rats & mice. Edit: field mice in particular.
I‚Äôm also glad I‚Äôm not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
"""*You can sifu stance your bitchass on outta here!""*"
Man people say baseball is dragged out but football is realllyyyy dragged out
as long as the tracking shows delivered, it's not your responsibility what happens to it after that
This feels like a joke [NAME] would tell. Love it
I double dog dare him.
It's full of what?!
yep, its still time based so 1st will be absolutely raking it in 
I've had a lot of frozen pizza in my day, and this to me looks like a Red Baron.
#CHECK THAT TRIPLE
No. It cannot. It's a dangerous fantasy (unironically)
It's a grey area, my grand dad on my mum's side is a devout [NAME] and he listens to music and performed when he was younger. 
lol deiaa. I went to school with the guy.
Cooinbase (controlled by mastercard) banned gab accounts too, nice
Be fiscally responsible and you could save a couple thousand probably, while still enjoying much of what this wonderful city has to offer. 
Don't make me kiss you!
haha love it!
That makes sense, I‚Äôm over explaining and I shouldn‚Äôt have to. Thank you! 
Even one second gets you killed against focus fire, especially if you're discorded, which is almost always in this meta. 
That username lmao
But we libertarians are incapable of blindly voting for a bad candidate based on party! /s
There's probably a YouTube video about how to do that....
Ooof, I‚Äôm so sorry, that is rough.
Only when going to sleep, already seen them all way too many times...
Way braver than me. Hope you have a great night. Cheers!
There was a commercial about men encouraging other men not to perpetuate toxic masculinity. Of course the Republicans felt it was condescending and anti-men.
Doesnt matter. Nobody sees me crying anyway when I always lock myself in my room.
This really comforted me. Like genuinely. Thank you so much. You seem like a truly amazing person.
Fact: violins don't make music. And if you think they do, you're stupid. 
These were one of the worst commentators I have ever been forced to listen to. The jokes were so cringe-worthy.
Thanks, [NAME].
Stands to reason. Those with the biggest stick(weapon) and all...
This reminds me of suits. (Currently about to start season four.)
ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator
Thanks my boet
It would honestly make sense for her track record and she‚Äôs releasing her new song and it‚Äôs a plastic runway and she made of plastic
I used to do the same exact thing! Now I love the fat on my steak and watching them cut it off in japanese restaurants makes me sad.
I found it using Guide to Purposeful Success. Hope it can help you the way it helped me!
And this is why I park my car in the woods when I wanna just chill. Thank you south jersey pines
Oh goodness, that show shaped my sense of humor. I loved it so much.
Hahaha. I see what you did there!
What's that thing you have pointed at your head, selloboy? Gun, forest, gun!
Damn, I really been playing this series all my life...and I ain‚Äôt got any regrets.
Funny that dinner sized is larger than lunch sized wherever you are. Seems like a very specific cultural thing.
Right. The comments people buy gold for astound me. I‚Äôve seen some dumbass comments get gilded then comments that deserve it get nothing.
it‚Äôs great
would it be like Caspian‚Äôs bombs where you have to directly be hit by it?
I'm not sure that there ever was a meritocracy. I always thought it was more of a myth created to keep the peasants from revolting.
It's not collapsing
How often are parents like that? I‚Äôm legit curious.
Thank you. Message me.
Other than family, I neither remember the last time I got a compliment 
Oh gosh dang it
He wasn't as mouthy around [NAME]... he seemed slightly intimidated... he needs to take a seat
That sucks, I hope you find the finances to be able to go back to it someday.
I call [NAME] fraud! That's not the first time she saw [NAME] after prison.
Into another environment?
How this post is still up??ü§îü§î
Does this mean anything for the stability of Taiwan? Im going there in a month on a school field trip that could easily be canceled.
This spoke to my soul. I might cry üò≠. I really do run away from my feelings
Just wait.
Thank you! On the positive side I‚Äôve gotten a lot of work done after panicking and giving up looking for my pill pack
hehe cheeky little guy
She could delete her personal accounts and create professional accounts that are only for advertising her business.
Absolutely not! If religions didn‚Äôt exist on this planet, we would be a far more advanced society.
I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself.
Love your username!
Rattles off potential free agent edge defenders, neglects to include [NAME].
They look pretty great tbh stache and all
"we have a ""righty"" complaining about ""lefties"" making up BS, while they make up BS... sad."
Glad he survived or it might have become a *dead*lift.
Especially mean! I‚Äôm with you. I like the funny posts but people use social media as an excuse to just be horrible people
Lol thanks! I thought it was funny but apparently my humor isn‚Äôt for everyone.
"It's hilarious that he thought you were a woman when you literally have ""man"" in your username. "
oh... haven't seen it.
Thats a move i havent seen before
Girl I went to school with was killed like this.
I visibly recoiled from that.
Was he good back then?
Preach in such a way that if people don't end up hating their sin, they end up hating you. -[NAME]
I'm sure the guy i lease my space from will love it when I ask to transfer some BAT to cover next month's rent.
Istn't there a trick about coating the metal with clear nail polish?
Stupid for difficult. I always feel that way. Fool among elites. That means I can be cared for.
Sport shooting can be done with air guns. Problem solved.
We aren't even buying it's loans and still nobody has been signed
This helped me when I was in my worst mental state. I'm glad
Losing to get draft picks doesn‚Äôt work as well as you think. A lot more goes into winning than getting a top 5 pick
My brah, [NAME] on the line up! Fuck yeah!
> Take away the snow and it looks like an IU home game. Damn [NAME].
You should‚Äôve just put that in the original comment then
That...that was way more disturbing than the top level sub. What the fuck?
Cured her depression, didn't it? 
I don't have anything of value to add, so here's this
But at least you could Get to [NAME] more quickly.
Also it seems like there is some possibility of the pole going backwards lol
I would not recommend water panties, you might find things a bit squishy! ;)

That's how mafia works
Worth a try to report the bus number, the route and the time to PTV to see if he can get them back. Best of luck!
Calling (some) media the Enemy of the People and Fake News - is that not impeachable in a non-bizarro world?
"My dog knows when I say ""BRB"" on the mic he gets up and runs to the door."
That was sexy
*gasp* video games are the devil!!!!
during Cowhers 15 seasons, HOF QBs (or future HOF QBs) won 13 of the 15 SBs. 
Thank you for the update, I‚Äôve been stressing about the shutdown and lines. This helps.
thanks, metropolitan looks legit according to google searches. 
Yeah, that makes sense, too. (Did it. Once. When I was like 16)
3/10 bad troll
Some forest i geuss. And if you are like me and don't give a fuck do it in a park or on a basketball playground.
[NAME] is my favorite qb prospect and I've been watching football for 11 years
Ah. Not on either of those. [NAME]! ::goes back to stalking profiles::
I'm not telling them, I was just saying that the person who knew them irl said they were a she. That is all
this gif encapsulates exactly how I feel commenting in FT vs everyone else here
Pull back too far while using too short of an arrow.
It's always nice to tell someone a pleasant story before they go to sleep.
My organs love me. I wonder how emotionally damaged a person has to be to come up with these. It's weird and sad.
Borderline Personality Disorder. It can be hard for me to form lasting relationships, although I‚Äôve been doing pretty well over the last few years.
Little scrub didn't even make it through the first week of NN19.
This shark is so beautiful i thought it was one of those high quality animations
Yeah mason wasps are nasty little Tucker‚Äôs.
I've just listened to it on my way from school today! [NAME] anatomy introduced some beautiful music.
accept no substitutes
Amazing notes. Posts like this is what make us feel that we are not alone in our struggles.
I cannot remember the dude's name, but I used to LOVE to watch him on Poker After Dark.
I love the immediate cut from the gladiator dying to the defeat screen. Makes it funnier
You DO seem nice. And friendly!
Ameen InshAllah. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôll try
Same, these are awesome!
This post fucking sucks because it doesn't cater to my beliefs.
Very cool.
[NAME] found the perfect position to not have to defend [NAME] or [NAME]. Amazing instinct to be honest
Because [NAME] doesn't have time to monitor what is going on in a couples bedroom.
See, guys??? It‚Äôs happening!!!! 
I kind of want to try that now actually. With some chocolate added I think it could work.
politely? I would hope they break into 30 minutes of laughter then ask no for real what do you want?
Too much sympathy in this thread for a creep who didn't get consent first. I'm glad he got humiliated on tv.
Oh, goodness!
Not without espousing blanketed partisan political opinions that will get me a million downvotes
Sad... RIP
Thank [NAME] for spoilers because if I didn't know any better I would be having a crisis over this Trinity performance for the next week.
I was searching my local craigslist! It says nationwide though- so love after lockup for everyone!!!!!
Those are precisely communist ideas.
yep, you don't hate Mondays, you hate capitalism. 
[NAME] has been attacking the basket a lot this game,good to see.
Did they really have overhead projectors in the late 00s/early 10s? If so, how underfunded was your school?
Alright thanks ill try, (but thats like dark souls on ng 100 XD)
Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.
It's pretty dangerous when the state decides which fictional deity is legitimate. For example the [NAME].....
*laughs in Panama Papers*
Thank you! I agree. We‚Äôve decided to back off. No need in feeding into it. :-)
Not sure to downvote because genuine and encouraging or to upvote because sarcastic and hateful.
So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot... I don't even know what's real anymore!
Yeah, apparently I missed the joke back there a bit Hahaha. 
worst case of life is unfortunately apt here, eh?
Nice asimov reference
Don't you know? We have to just shut up and put our heads down until they decide!
Jeez, I was joking
I realize. I was too hasty in my conclusions.
I don't think it's duping I think it probably loot cycling you can find almost the military gear from on the coast now.
I regret my psycho ex. Does that mean I was raped? Or do the rules not apply because I'm a man?
That's how my days go either way.
"Dog thinking ""shit this guy is crazy, better get out"""
And how she can‚Äôt cry bc of her ‚Äúexpensive lashes.‚Äù ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You okay bro? You seem emotional.
Just like [NAME] was defending himself against those younglings ;)
Well, I could already do that. But glad to have BCH as a pathway
I love this sub so much.
That‚Äôs it! Thank you!!
You‚Äôre the coward! I was the second man to walk on the moon. NEIL BEFORE ME.
Two problems: It's not a newsworthy story. You'd get sued for defamation.
No deal then? Sick of reading about this shite.
GSW vs TOR NBA FINALS WOULD BE DOPE BUT I WANT LAKERS VS RAPTORS TOO
hahah if only he had reddit
Not enough accurate data on [NAME] civil to stay true to their identity unless they want to make a Spanish invasion related storyline
Look at OP history, they are trying to sell their app hard.
Thank you so much!!! You are truly a lifesaver
"The last time it happened I just said, ""No"" and closed the door"
Unfortunately, we live in 21st century America, where this kind of behavior ensures that they will both be given high-paying jobs at CNN.
That was what our media guys said but he is now 1/3 in the shootout (was 1/2). No clue how they butchered that one so badly.
Thank [NAME] for your mother and her googling skills! Now if you have kids you know who allowed and welcome to be around them and who not.
I would love that, I kind of miss him
[NAME] just played her ass...hehehe
I always feel like cute gay couples have a pug...
Thanks for sharing :)
This is almost as effective as posting that sweet photo of [NAME] old band
She does have a great ass I‚Äôve always thought so
Maybe if I don't try to hide, they'll think someone else did it. 
now when I'm off work I completely forget it exists, I love it
You wont be in pain but you wont feel any relief either. Find what makes you feel comfortable and stick with it
Change the initials to fake names. Was going to read but it‚Äôs too annoying.
Fuck I laughed at this post :D You better stick to your words and make sure to Tag every BF:V Dev.
She just wants to make sure she has good casting for her character in the Lifetime movie.
Yet somehow that doesn't make death threats any less scary, because of the fear the 0.00001% of them will try to follow through on that threat.
Also thanks to 4chan
Is it just me or does it seem like she should have been able to get away with a couple scraped knees without the concussion
I‚Äôm not though üòÇ I do it by choice. ITS MY CHOICE TO HIT THAT BIG DOPE YA DIG üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº
There is nothing wrong with showing progress. Teams don't go from being last to best in just one year.
Then let's go scythe and HAMMER!!! I've actually wanted scythe and hammer for the longest too
[](/ironwillthumbsup) True! Weird, but true!
I'm not different than [NAME] secret refusing to sell male clothing.
That's clearly a clickbait title. Chances are it didn't actually happen.
Yes - thanks for this. Have just finally contacted a counsellor after talking about it for years.
I guess its the 9th largest city in the country but it it weird to group them together
Nut! Keep your eyes of my hay!
Lol they were trying so hard to get that viral
Aw Thank You.
I missed this too. Why did they split?
He looks especially cute in the glasses.
Great to hear that. Go beyond, plus ultra!
Haha I've got a mild case of UC, maybe I should be more dramatic about it and use it!
I made a severe and continuous lapse of judgement....
Love the beauty of nature.
This communities inability to understand sarcasm is absolutely awe inspiring.
Tigres ruining players /s
Hold on to your butts!
I don‚Äôt know but I think they at least have foil inside, I remember seeing you could hack one into an antenna.
One of the most reasonable comments I've ever read on the site (sad, right?). Salute to you
I have, and what I get is hundreds. I just wanted some advice on ones people would recommend 
...what? You're far more concerned with the o line than signing [NAME].
You win the poverty Olympics.
I don't think that lump is nearly as big as you think it will be
It wasn't any better 10 years ago if that offers any sense of relief.
...they were in the tree
Not too much, I‚Äôm talking to a girl right now that‚Äôs 5 years younger than me lol.
Or as we like to call them.... HAI-YUN-DAIEEE
I'll pass.
Your mother is an idiot. If she somehow proved that you were an unfit parent to your children your stbx husband would get them not her.
I mean it‚Äôs kind of weird that they miss that part we‚Äôre the Bible acknowledges other gods for selfish reasons
I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude
Um... I‚Äôm extremely concerned as to which one‚Äôs business and which one‚Äôs casual.
If this continues for V7, I'm gonna start getting *real goddamn salty.*
Keep going... üòèüòèüòèüòè
Wait, no one finds it odd that Russia was playing war games over American airspace the day before?
Thanks for your kind words, I really appreciate it and I hope you're right.
Trolls are okay in this sub but let's be more serious here
This should be on r/Unexpected oh wait...
Great for domestic workers.
It‚Äôs a party and we‚Äôre all invited
are your feelings hurt?
I hate [NAME] but this dude has already lied to Congress. How can you believe anything he says
I've been pinched a couple times by it's tiny brothers, would not recommend holding that! Damn! It's cute tho. 
Afaik non-government entities can sue other non-government entities for any reason.
Spending the day with family in beautiful Bowral üåø
Online is still in beta. GTA online spent months having disconnect issues and still has them from time to time even 5 years later
I have a few WG brushes and a handful of other Fude so I‚Äôm really interested on how this turns out...could be good.
Damn didn‚Äôt see it sorry
oh, ive seen that, ugh breeders have such weird and confusing minds
Alright, I'm all ears as to what the HUGE difference is.
LOL, you‚Äôre a good sport. In all seriousness pretty cool picture.
>testing teenagers for four mystery roles Oh good lord. This is going to be even worse.
I actually like my vagina... I suspect it‚Äôs actually my husband that is the problem
Yankees, Nets, and Giants, all the best!
What evidence at all shows that [NAME] was an accomplice?
I used to have anxiety when calling people but I no longer have them at least just 20-30% anxiety.
He only has 1 cap in a friendly but that's fine. Just can't play in a competitive international match.
Eat better.
Kinda. And thank you. I'm curious about those files and film and fotos you mentioned.
The one catch is they will absolutely slave drive you for that wage. But at least you're getting paid what you're worth.
I used to have a German Shepherd X Siberian Husky that looked so much like this.
So in other words you don‚Äôt have one? So much for attempting to be on the same page.
Bruh this the magic, we shouldn't have to have a big comeback
He's shooting very efficiently, too. Most of his FGs scored at the rim.
Dudes never show any interest in me irl so I was just thinking about getting a Tinder. Seems like people have much lower standards on there so fuck it
[NAME] and [NAME] are definitely not wings. I like the other guys though.
Way to go! I know who this couple is! they appear really happy!
Overhead fans are absolute shit. They literally do nothing but blow dust around.
How else can you boil water in prison
I‚Äôm now getting the last of the tea out of my nose
Wow, way to deflate Endgame's stakes *even more* before the movie even comes out.
I was really hoping Vikings would get a bear mask but this also looks sick! RIP all my steel
How do we know you're not a Mossad agent? I mean, not right now but, what if you joined in the future? /s
I'd prefer it that way than the alternative reality in which [NAME] knows where I live.
[NAME] 1st wife was his fucking cousin
Welcome to MTV Cribs! The whole place is a giant bed for me
She might be hungry too since she didn‚Äôt lose her head ... feed that skinny thang
Terrifyingly accurate bot
They've done it before with private law and private militias, dumbass. 
 Best number! [NAME], [NAME], [NAME]
Ay just like my life *whips whilst sobbing
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a repost. To anyone who‚Äôs cake day is 2 dayü§ó
What does she want? No sex with you! Your giving up which is what she wants! She wins and you lose. Pretty simple!
Some judges are just literally scum. Have those in Germany aswell. Unfortunately.
It's just a hug
I liked the charlie one more.
She really does and She really isn't! She's an old, tired ass, busted up, con artist hoe!
Well to be fair to these idiots Family Guy constantly makes episodes complaining about their lack of Emmys.
My favourite is peeing in restrooms and your feet can't touch the floor while sitting on the toilet.
my fianc√© enjoys all the aspie things I do and thinks they're cute. I don't understand why, but I appreciate it nonetheless.
yay another let's keep nerfing survivors to the ground patch... fun
This guy looks like an extreme feminist with a man‚Äôs face
Im curious what shirt [NAME] is getting for the dance dance stream after all that sub train.
"I did this for Christmas to coming home. Somewhere in Illinois I said to myself ""fuck this Im flying next time and renting a car."""
I really hope he declares this year. Kid is a beast
This man looks so much older without the cap
my little abomination
Really feeling you today.
Oh I didn‚Äôt realize you were saying that, my bad . And yes that‚Äôs a great idea that would help develop him 
Mercy and clique I understand but creepers is one of my [NAME] songs
It's always been Marfeles. Was 30 years ago when I first visited.
Ugh yes that makes sense. Thanks for the response.
I'm very sorry for u, they should treat you like royalty not a fleshlight
Not everyone find it meaningful, but it helped me and my friends at least :) Hope others may find it useful too
That is true, yet that is a problem of the systematic exploitation in capitalism, not the fault of existence/birth per se. 
And now what you've been waiting for, another long raga by [NAME].
I'm curious as to how to explain this to a young child? I will like I flounder at this.
Your comment from exactly 40 days ago was, ‚ÄúYour mom.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you eat your words. 
I feel so guilty that this picture exists. I feel like I need to donate to charity after this.
Shhhh, don‚Äôt say that, your going to trigger a millennial 
We got killed by the 7-11 guy yesterday so [NAME] had to bring out the valet guy.
This is powerful. I appreciated it so much. I hope to end up as free and as confident as you
Don't let her find out we do that here then. She'll want one.
We are by far the greatest team the world has ever seen, we are just having a rough patch.
No clip? Screenshot? Picture at all? Sounds fake as hell
Don't know what more to say then. Your fridge full of beers that are all around 6% ABV says it all.
*[NAME] jumps out of window
What a cutie!
Can I be a bartender EDIT: I make a mean Pink [NAME]
IM GOING TO GO BACK TO INDONESIA UNLESS YOU STOP PAYING CHILD SUPPORT YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING ALESS AND [NAME]
Cheat - no. Disrespect her current relationship partner - heavily to the point of her ass deserving to be thrown out.
Fidget spinners are cool again
Then let's point it out even harder! Oh, and by the way, Happy Cake Day!
Wow so much younger but he sounds mature
Forget [NAME]. You gotta go to El Campo....
Sounds like she wants dessert, but hates you eating any cake. 
That's why he's gotta go!! Yes, girls!
i still remember by my first dodger game in 2001
"I agree. You can support a cop getting some pushback from a prole without supporting the one doing said ""pushback""."
Now *I‚ÄôM* angry
I thought you looked familiar, get back over to r/NCAAW
what did you put for second is my real question, everybody knows what at number 1, just like everybody knows [NAME] verse on monster
no do not destroy [NAME] pope and glorius god emperor will cry :((((
Do you think he is guilty or innocent, no need to use triple and quadruple negatives here
[NAME] being the ROY and the DSJ situation has def distracted the media on how bad [NAME] has been
> Literally no one cares if you stay or go, Funny you should say that...
I guess I‚Äôll stay friends with her. Heck I‚Äôm a guy I can take a hit if she wouldn‚Äôt date
Let me give you a hint: THEY PLAY IN BOSTON!!!
If nothing was said and you can be engaged all day tomorrow then I wouldn‚Äôt worry.
You could just omit the walking part.....
In America [...] the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires. - [NAME]
Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.

I hope his pants fell down from the extra weight lmao
That‚Äôs my favorite insult ever
I know to you Professor, break time is nothing. But to me, it's serious.
Oh my [NAME] why did I look
I would say you‚Äôll be fine just drink water and maybe run/sweat a few times before your drug test!
"Classic lab. ""Man that was really tough, but can we go play now?"""
Lmao, your joke did not go unnoticed to me!
Aw how cute, the human garbage wants help. 
That blows. Glad you're doing better.
LET THE BOYS PLAY
She reminds me of my crazy sister. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying.
[NAME] because hes best survivor
Woah, how manly.
So how depressing is it that I know that's not true? You still gotta pay for a cold delivery.
Because sloppy seconds is a childish concept and I dont see bargain basement girls.
I did watch it and didn‚Äôt see the thing OP mentioned. So I am not sure what I was supposed to gain from watching.
That's what I thought! Kotake and Koume!
How generous :) you must really make them happy. Good on you for that
I‚Äôve seen it too. I think it was an honest mixing of the words.
What a fucking cunt
I wouldn't be surprised if they were. Hopefully it stays with the amount of drama they have and don't go in the direction of 90DF.
Key words: ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù
Link please? I‚Äôd like real evidence that we‚Äôre in imminent danger.
Glitter is awful for everything
Are you retarded?
It took me, like, 3 hours to finish the shading on your upper lip. It's pretty much the best drawing I've ever done.
[NAME]. I still want her to come back to be a [NAME] ally and fight with [NAME].
Fake lous!
If he would have landed that swing, it would have decapitated that guy.
Eastside Cafe was pretty pricey for what it was.
Some people just don't understand humor. Imagine living your life like that!
I thinks he's the leader of one those Turkish backed rebel groups. He was accused of raping the wife of one his soldiers and screwing prostitutes.
I love spaghetti... Can I have your recipe?
But you said it was just that one time right? Could have been a fluke.
^She ^took ^me ^by ^the ^hand... ^made ^me ^a ^man... ^THAT ^ONE ^NIGHT!

Yeah because a country can't multitask. Go pedal your propaganda elsewhere
You deserve WAY more upvotes
Happy new year!
They‚Äôre proud about having liberals make themselves look stupid with covfefe memes.
Big if true
"""Sad"" but ""true"" There you go I fixed it for you."

I do. but some people love it
And a place to live
My man!
AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property. 
Mermaids don't exist.
Can you please write up a summary of how the event went? The live stream isn't working because they changed the venue. Thank you!
You should stop visiting it then no?
What makes you say that?
Well, quite. Now I‚Äôm all annoyed.
That‚Äôs awesome!
Thanks, came here for this
They do it because easily entertained people appears to be .... entertained by this. So they won't stop until people stop clicking on this trash
Don‚Äôt worry, we can be crucified together üôåüèø
Haha I hope this is real. Look up neti pot. Warm water will soften the paper and come out.
Do you really think anyone would support this legislation on any side. Jeez man lay off the [NAME] plus that would really destroy the CIA/FBIs blackmail program lol
It's not even Goats. Just got to the point I realised the Devs don't care about what happens below high elo.
Same.. If I'm particularly stressed out someone just walking down the same road as me feels like they're invading my space.
They've already said that they don't care about Russia or collusion. They are so far gone.
You are, or you're. Thanks
I audibly gasped
Give a listen to Gramatik, he is amazing
Wonder what [NAME] [NAME] thinks about all this
Like i said he has only asked us once and this is 13 days before our rental agreement ends
I thought you said it was last night. But looking back now it's this weekend. well go get'em tiger.
This is a great photoshop! On a related note... retire [NAME] Number and Maybe [NAME] number..... oh and also fire Garpax
The whole thing is poetry. That finish is magic. Nose to the mit. Love this !
This is without a doubt the funniest thing I've ever seen
Hello there fellow Bolts fan, ride the lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è
Shoulda called the cops straightaway
Yup like 40/60 for me
Any food shortages will be caused by these idiots each buying 38 tins of beans a few days before we leave.
oliver and black canary is evergreen.. [NAME] is the most annoying character since season 3.. why would CW come up with that
Nobody likes you
i am. This means i will move from MTN to VODACOM. and i only roam!! Wow
I think most of these pictures would be much scarier if we had the perspective of the guy
[NAME] is my fav skater of all time he's sick
haha they definitely test for patience... looking at you gov.uk, and the whole of hmrc if I'm honest.
My love for [NAME] has nothing to do with his Blackpool performance
Lol that‚Äôs great. Grew up in north jersey and had the opposite experience
I fucking love that you actually educated me a little about punk. Thanks for the suggestions, I'll definetly listen to them.
They stole his toilet bucket
That book is awesome
I understand your point, but I prefer if we did not consider that.
Right, but their wages *are* lower *because* they get tipped.
I hear lyft is better
Nobody forced [NAME] to take [NAME] over [NAME], if he liked him that much then he should‚Äôve just taken him.
I like your sleeves... they‚Äôre real big
Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.
Are you replying to something in particular, because what you stated is so obvious I would hope it need not be said on a science thread.
I love how many penguins stopped and waited for him üòç
That is interesting. Can you site some sources or anything on this matter ? I am genuinely intrigued .
Ah yes you cant forget [NAME] vs the ra
Pulp Fiction is fucking amazing
This person shouldn't be allowed to drive ever again.
I know. Come to us [NAME] and be lulled to sleep by [NAME] and his soft Catalan/Norf London brogue
And pizza. Don't forget pizza. The roof of my mouth feels like a battlefield after I have eaten a hot pizza.
[NAME] has lost it and I'm loving it!
Haven't noticed this comment before but, fcking [NAME], [NAME] really has become a household name hasn't she...?
Oh the bloating
I'm pretty sure she wants to be alone with you
blessed day with beautiful boy
Anybody who likes to drink water with ice is a degenerate
I think he is dead but he died long before the supposed raid. He was old and sick, dying of kidney failure.
Signed jersey from the Bulldogs 2012 team.
Must be why I'm alive. That sucks.
It‚Äôs fun until you‚Äôre looking back
"And then there's ""having to listen to parents bragging about how hard they have it"" tired."
The number of pedos is too damn high!
"You are like 2 years away from being Mr [NAME].... ""eeeeexcellent"""
It sounds like you‚Äôre the one who is afraid of the internet. Relax, bud. You‚Äôre on r/cringe 
Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem.
Yes but did you see how bad his reaction was, he was about to crash with her and make it worst, just back up üí® 
Everybody is talking about [NAME], but what about that ball control and through ball from his teammate?
Sounds like they‚Äôre not responsible and shouldn‚Äôt have the right to have these.
Thank you for charging your fucking phone!
Of course. I'm curious as to why you'd think it was a bad sign?
I look forward to him posing for photos with his new mole-wife.
I'm on mobile but clearly I need to get on desktop! edit: am on pc, is wonderful!
depends on the artist that made it more than anything
LOL [NAME] AND [NAME] JUST PLAYING WITH THEM
This made my hump day. Thank you good sir
People who eat themselves to death are mentally ill in my opinion. Homicide is a deliberate and unlawful killing of a person by another person.
Hands to the back
> a nearly-neutered government Starving the beast rather than killing it.
He has a kid that he pays child support and my 2 younger siblings that he also calls leeches
Oh so now we‚Äôre not letting plays finish before calling offside cool..
I got your back, bros. (nsfw, duh) 
That's if you make the smallest payments possible, but if you just need to float a payment, then they will work. 
This. You need medical attention and they'll be able to put you in touch with resources.
No telling I know is not eat it, I like eggs and I like cottage cheese but yuck no they can‚Äôt touch!
You really should not group people with ones you have had bad experiences it will not help you grow
Volume-wise, you are correct. 
i am not a lesbonim so no (that's another friends reference btw)
this is amazing and you have the cutest voice i‚Äôve ever heard :>
Thank you. If im not authorized to pickup from daycare tomorrow ill get my daughter friday with this court order and the police if necessary.
This is badass. I'd love to see it placed over war pigs. Amazing work OP
I thought [NAME] had said he hoped to stay in Ottawa? I'd love if they signed him though.
Just [NAME] rush the sub, they can try and get us but we‚Äôll break through like the videos of the England team they tried deleting.
Educate yourself instead of defining yourself.
Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
wanting to kill other people doesn't? all i'm saying is, you wanna kill people - start with yourself. 
Exactly. He is doing a diet trend that just happens to be meat-free.
Just get in front of him and stop
Elly's is dog friendly for brunch.
Kinda surprised he listed [NAME] and [NAME] in particular, but not [NAME]. I guess this is the Leafs spotlight working in real time here.
You know what, I think we're gonna be friends. *Special* friends. 
Go with her, eat healthy food with her too. It may help
Poor lady, she was the mother of a friend of my wife, and she went to school with my father in law :(
No way dude. The Wilpons‚Äô are so cheap that the Twitter guy is also the contract guy. (Was that a good Twitter impression?)
Credentials are just the type of the iceberg. I know people who got married lying about their marital status and sexual orientation.
And I will laugh at everyone wasting their first round pick on him.
Been refreshing for days hoping for the Munchak news!
I‚Äôm not arguing for it. I just think the punishment doesn‚Äôt fit the crime.
Why ask other than to be rude?
That.. would be glorious. A large one of these would be the NZ equivalent of Giga Pudding.
I'm so racist and self important I refuse to braid this girls hair
nothing special? I drop stuff like this mate
Sorry I forgot a word! I added it back in, thanks for letting me know
Goodbye my tank commander!
Tell them personally how you feel and that you want things to change for better
You're most welcome!
Awesome, love the input! I totally get what you‚Äôre saying!
Policing The Police': How The Black Panthers Got Their Start
Love situations like this...excited to see if he'll make it by tomorrow
Thanks!! I missed all of this.
Oh good one. It‚Äôs insane to think the last three mvps were once on one team
Personally I think anyone false claiming Jailor and continously claiming it every night while not being mafia deserve idk like a week griefing ban or something.
Strong focus on what the subreddit wants
I do this all the time and I have honestly never noticed.
Especially hard last night looking at Snapchat stories.
>I Shouldn't have to explain this By all means, please do
Then fling baseless insults at me. Youre doing great.
It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
Why would [NAME] retire when he still has 5 horcruxes left?
You get a lot more freedom and free time. College is a blast
They‚Äôre grossed out that these two are blatantly grinding outside of a bar/club environment.
Glad we cleared this up
This was a beautiful moment for the FT coming together
"""In valor, there is hope"""
thats just an unpopular opinion, and legally wrong.

Ph and Tesla doesn't do advertising. So any mention like this is fun to see
i miss this show so much
What's the cringe?
Because his reconnaissance is not unique in any way. Literally everyone who saw that movie thought that was surprising.
[NAME] is so goddamn good
Just found UPPERROOM a few months ago and really love them! All the rest are staples in my playlists too!!!
Hope it works for you OP.

Nice quote, not sure if it was worth the time to pull up though.
F yeah!
Ahhh, I see it now. Thanks.

Isn't this the game that is PS4 as well?

"Very tired us can attendant: ""here are your vagina slimes."" ... thankfully the customer just laughed kt off."
I fucking love that scene.
I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.
"Even worse: ""Share something interesting about yourself."" Suddenly I become the most boring person ever to exist."
Sharing with 3 other people was the worst part of hospital for me, fine in the daytime but at night I was barely able to sleep.

Acute services are just for that, for acute services. It sucks, but it's not your doctor's fault.

Lucky the patient passed out, they wont feel any of it or hear anything you're saying!
Honestly if I didn't have this many favorite characters not yet in the game, I would probably waste my 7 votes on Merlinus.

Apparently those corpses, along with hideouts, are the only ones that can give you treasure maps

I will. If you ever need help I ain‚Äôt afraid to put some people straight just holla.
If I got killed by someone while they're stunned I'd uninstall my game.
Such a handsome young man. He looks hungry. Are we not feeding him enough? Should I make some sandwiches? We're so proud of him.

Not a [NAME] fan myself, but there's no reason to comment on his weight or appearance. It only makes your side look bad.
This is why I stopped watching. :( The brutality was disgusting.
My point was they had no choice but to pull social levers to try and improve health, as they didn't have anything else at their disposal.

Ignoring your Motte and Bailey. What makes the medical needs of America so unique?

Hi, this is [NAME] from Hairspray the movie...I care! 
I think it‚Äôs a physical comfort preference having to do with the cut/shape, rather than an aesthetic preference.
But you understand that the whole point here is to get [NAME] in that suit.
[NAME] is from the Bay. I'm sure he believes [NAME] is the greatest of all time as well.

Should have drafted [NAME] and then never traded for THJ...Anyways, just happy we got [NAME] out of this finally.
Is this what people with too much money do?
[NAME]
It has its moments, that's for sure.

Who tf told you that weirdo is left?
Do not destroy your life bc of feelings for an underaged person. think back to when you were 14
He did not cheat on you. He ended it with that other woman before committing to you.
He posts on The_Donald, you're arguing with a brick wall
Yup. Was so annoyed to see this making the rounds yesterday.
Some great advice right here!!!!!! I forgot about this
The emojis in the background. Wtf lmao
There are definitely real women like that.

I feel terrible but I do this too, or watch obese people doing mukbangs
I thought from his accent maybe he was or he'd spent a lot of time there.
1 5v5 goal in 2 months is not good anyway you spin it. But pleasure being downvoted by you, enjoy believing in WAR 
Don't ask women for dating advice unless you are a woman. The answers you get will do you no good.
Bear in mind the first sighting was at 9pm, hard to get good footage after sunset
There it is!
OMG, how did they do that? I mean killed Petunias. My pot is from Bunnings as well.
Yes my mother is ok with it.
While we certainly have these people, we also have an election coming up which makes me suspicious of this group.
Women can pick on a man's height but all hell breaks loose if you tell their make up is garbage and they might have a weight problem.
It looks a little like my 5th grade science experiment...
What happens when he takes a shower with his girl and his facial hair just starts falling off.
The lunatic is on the grass.
Cringe and try hard, elaborate please.
DAE think that [NAME]‚Äô insults towards [NAME] are lowkey racist and dissmissive.
[NAME] needs help!
Don't forget the something else I clearly don't understand.
This particular clip had been posted dozens of times already. Still adorable but come on guys!
Thanks for not responding to my comment like this, it just shows even more that you are a troll.
"I'm more concerned that the kid's name is ""[NAME]""."
Because they‚Äôre going to have trouble crossing the *language barrier*.
Drugs are a hell of a drug...
Dunno what youre going on about bud, i was just informing him of the skins inspiration 
My bad I just realized it, I‚Äôm 31M and she‚Äôs 31F
Because they are idiots.
It was the other way around. The actors started dating after spending so much time filming together this season.
ah, rejection. i know something about it
That's because: Emotion = Reality
Lol. Build your own or make some tweaks to the printer.
The sin was refusing to impregnate his brother's widow when [NAME] directly told him to. It's not just about wasting semen.
Yea feel sad for that kid, that native guy is an anti [NAME] activist who destroyed his life 
"Another reason to instantly kill people who constantly use the word ""awesome"" for everything. This is just brainless mediocrity at its best."
That was a bitter sweet ending to This or That with Kobe and Jatt
LPT for controversial thing use bing. They dont filter as muchas google.
I appreciate your meme OP.
If you don't understand something then you want tyranny...
Erin's is so precious
Yes the achilles gave out and so did my hopes. I miss brandon :(
Just relax and enjoy. We are gonna win by double figures as per usual.
I'm too scared to start Black Mirror because it honestly seems like we might not be that far off from some of it.
That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence.
Oh god dammit I've been bamboozled, I fell for the b8
[NAME] had the government for 2 years and couldn't get a wall funded. But sure, it's all the dems fault.
Is there anything more conclusive, recent, and far reaching than a survey in 1988 Arizona?
Don't feel bad I am sure the otters are getting taken care care of just fine.
Ok shady flags are flapping so hard I was knocked out of my chair.
I can‚Äôt wait for this Narrative to stop. DLO has the best numbers just look.
Konami?! They havent made a relevant or decent game since the 90s.
That poor girl who said she'd help out is about to get a surprise when she finds out she has to pay for the coffee.
Excited for you guys to be there see you there [NAME]!
Acid/shrooms - [NAME]. [NAME] is a psychedelic jesus.
Damn! You were so close! Scary. Damn damn!
[NAME] is playing with so much energy today. New year, new haircut, maybe he's feeling like it's an opportunity for a fresh start. 
They are, but they're rarer than winning the lottery on Christmas. That looks so shiny.
Enjoy the ride!
You got it, just keep doing whatever you were doing the past 20-whatever days. Constrict that demon, dude.
Thanks! I'll work on this next time!
I agree with all of this except for [NAME]... he wasn‚Äôt really all that bad of a guy, [NAME] needs to take his spot.
Impressive to have such foresight.
oh you.
You dont need elected officials to have power when you have the people on your side.
This sub is filled with bitterness.
This is the proper timing
[NAME] AND [NAME] ENMESHED IN FISHY SEX SCANDAL!
poor [NAME] is in jail now for assassination.
Perfect example of the disgusting misuse of ‚ÄòOrwellian‚Äô on this website
I understand it but I hate it and I personally believe it promotes toxicity
You'd better not cry!
Yeah having a camp invetory was something i already wished they add to the game, the crafting part i did not think of..
The Gillette commercial slandered men as being creatures of evil
Seriously. I wonder if OP has seen some of the amazingly stupid faces that [NAME] and [NAME] make.
Love this, and the comments are great, thanks for sharing.
It‚Äôs got to be embarrassing at this point
Just read your list, sounds great!! You have some creatures even I didn‚Äôt think about üëç!!
Aww, it‚Äôs retarded. 
His Wonderlic score is 25 points higher than [NAME] but 17 lower than [NAME]. I guess he is so/so.
I dont think they were angry att them self. Its allways the kids fault./s
I reported you :-) Expect to find your comment deleted within a few hours :-)
They understand alright, they just don't give a shit. Bunch of fucking scum.
Then she tries to just blow it out. Yup, that should work.
[NAME] were the peak memes back when I first started on Reddit. Honestly none of the meme subs are good, they're all pretty cringy. 
Ah yes, taxes=Nazism. You [NAME] sure are a funny bunch.
Block her.
Interesting read, thanks. Still a 40% bust rate. Sucks that someone's job is on the line with that high of a chance of failing. 
Going to my favorite greasy burger place in Madison tonight to celebrate my ability to eat delicious burgers whenever I want because I'm in my early 20's
to be fair that's most fanbases (and especially those of teams with losing records for a few years like ours)
i love it when [NAME] injects himself with sassy serum üòä
I see you've bought into the utter fantasy of UK house price fake news The average semi detached house price is ¬£227,912
That makes sense with NBC owning coverage of the Olympics.
Feels like cod
Thanks I love him
[NAME] has been a pleasant surprise
What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.
No I meant it's like the 5th post I've seen this week about it. 3 of them have been memes.
It‚Äôs nice to look at the comments and see other people who don‚Äôt like this.
Seeing [NAME] score on them was unbelievable. How embarrassing!
There's less chance [NAME] will elect a moron dumber than he is.
It's a shame when a really attractive person does this to themself. Pretty eyes great smile.
So true, thank you for posting this.
It's vodka/tonic time for me buddy! I'm off work!!!! Hope all yaw be safe and have a great night!
I love Wayfair! Just started using them and am impressed. Sounds like UPS sucks. Enjoy your couches! Haha

My father actually works in McDonald‚Äôs headquarters and he said they were shocked when the video came out, they had no idea.
OP is just a kid. Let's just move on.
Oooooow check it out, HIRED guy. *fist bump*
Don't worry, no one agrees with [NAME]! I bet you're doing an amazing job.
Thanks I needed that.
Where's the blindfold?
I was so hyped after the zach shot, I'm still crying 
Mo bam a or sicko mode
Very cool thanks!
You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.
Exactly. And they parade around with their protruding stomachs as if they're [NAME] gift to the world. *barf*
It's harder to find a decent picture of him
Oh my god. Don't you know it's illegal to share memes if you don't have an IQ of 16 trillion?
i passed thanks everyone
That's probably how she got the infection in the first place...
I‚Äôm not crying. Nope, no tears over here! 
That really is fantastic
What the hell is going on at Getty Images?
They scammed you by wasting your time
making photos look pretty
Had my suspicions but didn't want to mindread such a civilized honest actor.
Of course I have. It‚Äôs nothing, absolutely nothing like this. Its just a few much bigger pieces that break apart now.
Did anyone else think he was using a bad filter from Snapchat at first?
My boyfriend is transitioning and I hope he turns out as handsome as you!
No, I mean actual policies. Not self-described image. 
Alright stop.
I want to see this happen simply because it makes no sense.
It‚Äôs the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.
Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.
oh, you're back? have you gotten help for your paranoia yet?
Glad she reads the comments of every [NAME] Facebook post ever
Sorry, sometimes I really can't tell in here. 
You know it‚Äôs bad when you grab the toothpaste and start reading it
Canopy Growth will be valued at 1 trillion USD at one point.
happy early birthday OP! have fun !
I did not post this. I really do find it funny tho
I didn't mean to imply you did! I just know that's a mistake I've seen a lot of people make, is all
Gotta offload this crap somehow.
did a fanspeak mock, wow I wish this would go down for us
"Lmao the cop stops like *""Fuck, well I guess he won't be resisting on the way""*"
Absolutely. 100%.
.250/.330/.460 imo. And for a team who has had no 1B since Tex, this is more than fine. 
Don‚Äôt forget Kylie 1.0 was in it !!
When we talk about being douches it's about being the [NAME], an outgoing guy, shameless and cruel with women.
it looks like she took it in a totally different direction which i‚Äôm loving
You've been muted. Usually awarded for extreme toxicity, don't worry though its temporary.
Be happy because I won't be short anymore one day
Funny thing is, all of my salespeople who consistently sell 20/mo are constantly on the phone. Weird!
This might actually be one of the few cases where parallel poly will make sense, then ^^
Lol this fan base has the memory of a goldfish.
Easy money, thank you [NAME]
That's not what I've heard ;)
Is there a subreddit that makes fun of SJWs?
This guy's an idiot lol
There are tons of great places on the fringes where you‚Äôre guaranteed good loot and a vehicle.
Oh [NAME] how awful
I love it that they're filming this with a phone or something
That was awesome. the gross spin by [NAME] and the one legged glider by [NAME]. beautiful
"Exactly. I forget what the ""killed per year in a school shooting"" figure is but it's shockingly low."
YOU DON'T GET TO JUDGE ME!
Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)
He is not acknowledging anything, he is hoovering. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
I think that would be stretching the usual usage of whataboutism. Obviously I am not the arbiter of what it means as a new word.
Sooo inappropriate and sooo awkward. He looked so uncomfortable and [NAME] wouldn't stop. I hated watching that scene.
Sexy teeth.
Fake news! but really, that's awesome to have a parent that actually understands how to teach their child accountability. 
[NAME] wasn't apart of that team. That was [NAME]
We literally share a parking lot with a bank and I get people asking me for change all. The. Time. I struggle.
No. You're not the only one.
Always. And on a shallower note, he is aging so well, the handsome devil. 
I am so glad they didn't have this attendance in my day, skipping class would be impossible.
This is all I can think about when I see these things. Most of them cannot be properly washed.
Wow! That takes guts! I‚Äôm so squeamish that I can hardly stand getting a shot üòÇ
People working in hospitals are seriously under appreciated.
I don't feel so financially secure
Wow this made my forehead hurt it was so cringey. I love it.
I‚Äôll keep that in mind lol thanks a lot!
Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem.
"""Yoohoo~ Remember,remember,the fifth of dismember!"""
Great idea to brag about workplace violation on Facebook!
Well, I probably would have been against the Cespedes signing if we had to sign him for 7 years. But that goes more for a pitcher.
Respect for the person to let you know upfront.
Let's be fair to them and say not forever. But at least until I die.
Pro? Everyone does is and that makes it even more rude.
Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.
Ours are 30 minutes. Define by contract. Both long enough and not long enough
The new Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs looks great
And suck this guy off at the same time
Not sure about ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but women artists have an intuitive grasp of color theory and tend to use color in a more pleasing way.
It's just a natural reaction of people blaming white people as a whole for all the bad things in history.
What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
She just missed her shot at a champagne douche.
Where did I say that happened? Lmao most of my friends are single for the record. Quit jumping to conclusions.
Yes, but [NAME] is right when he warns about the US involvement in Venezuela.
Now all I‚Äôm imaging is [NAME] casted in the American pie movies as [NAME]. Thank you for this memory.
But what‚Äôs wrong with mayo
My First thought too! I get really bad stress knots in my neck and shoulders. I just don‚Äôt dare to ask every Damn day it hurts
This is so repulsive and disgusting. The government needs to do more to protect organising.
Stop using that excuse he hasn't been dominant since returning
You sound like a great mum
just supporting the Padres and cheering against Dodgers-supporting teams
I suppose all the other [NAME] dont count as competition
This is the beginning of a comeback for the ages.
Yes they do. Thank you for the idea!
This is actually funny OP, stop trying to be so negative
by deep pockets do you mean the Fleshlight?
They‚Äôre led by...gasp... a WOMAN!
Oh lol. I always just typed them out manually. :hamsad:
OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
Maybe he's too lazy to take it off
*curb your enthusiasm theme intensifies*
"You should see the absurd number of ""gays for [NAME]"" we have in my country, it's astounding"
I know. I get that a lot.
And yet when it comes to hard news several studies have shown that they are the most fair and balanced when it comes to coverage interesting isn't it.
I‚Äôm not sure why they thought it was cute, but this is what that alluded 
Interesting how [NAME] leads his team in BPM and RPM every year while not being the most important player. Defense and efficiency matters.
I mean, you're the one rationalizing for what essentially amounts to a presidential dictatorship.
She just turned her kid into a stew
Someone tell Disney. The evil mouse has sued daycare centers for painting Mickey on their walls, they sure as hell will sue for this abomination.
It almost looks like stuff from Japanese Pizza Huts !!
I saw a pic on twitter where she was also wearing a fur stole and she looked amazing.
I hate waking up. Being asleep doesn‚Äôt last long enough. Being asleep is so peaceful.
Did you win? We need one positive thing out of this disaster of a Saturday night.
The whole trinity!!
This will either be a classic or a complete shitshow
i mean I love the smell of race fumes
Why am I crying alone in my room rn
That actually makes sense, thank you for answering my question. Did you try training your dog?
And publicly claimed he banged [NAME].
NOT TODAY REINHARDT
I just spent the whole week sneaking away to smoke, and trying to get into some girls shorts. 
Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade.
F. No!!!!
Mr. [NAME] Moderate himself. I do hope the DCCC pours money into [NAME] rematch campaign when he declares.
Contentious statements cause unrest in public forum. In other news water is wet.
Strip him. [NAME] for the belt.
imagine being engaged to someone and then finding out he has been hiding that he is a MLP fan
Sorry. I read that as newly white and it cracked me up.
It's a lot of projection. Pretty much anything they point fingers at others for, is something they're guilty of.
Oh man... my grandparents on both sides of the family have passed away and it was tough... we‚Äôre here for you
Because the content creators don't deserve to be paid, your seconds spent listening to ads are too valuable!
Stop having kids you can't afford. Make sure you check the kids credit to make sure there are no accounts opened in their name. Good luck!
This is really well put. I saved it.
happy cake day
I want to give my peers money, so they can fight for my rights and privilges- see the bus pass discussion in this thread.

Natural selection, I love you. 
This is where the fun begins.
what are you even talking about
the only way to forever libertarian utopia is by crushing liberty [NAME]. Listen to yourself.
Your body, your choice. Sorry it had to mean the end of the relationship. But it's better now rather than later as tensions grow. 
I loved this look and it was good but this comment..
Guys a vulture who is feeding off people's fear.
Imagine finding that in your bed
You're giving her too much credit.
Wow, that's quite a depressing article. I agree with points being made, but slow down with the doom and gloom.
Err, she's still a weird fake tan shade, just oranger.
Spurs gonna get two in a row over us. Embarrassing
They‚Äôre looking sharp!!
I like [NAME].
Nah, share it then down vote it in to oblivion.
No problem. Released today is suppose to be in parenthesis.
Our father will protect us <3
Some girls will like you, some girls won't. The end.
Which is why he wasn't the best at colonialism. You can't just murder the people you're supposed to enslave.
odd she acts so spoiled considering her parents seem decent.
[NAME] is lactose intolerant, so when it comes to milk he likes to drink soythress
Welcome to the party, pal!
what did you guys expect for sunny gray
Yup. I don't want to soil the paper unless I have something very interesting to write about.
[NAME] here!
I can't stand having my motives questioned.
I will say that her housing bill left a very bad taste in my mouth, and this is coming from someone with a very high opinion of [NAME].
"Not only that, the ""improved controls"" aren't a thing at all. I'm not re-buying Blood Money for nicer graphics. "

Thank you for helping me realize that p&r bloopers is exactly what i need right now
Awesome, thank you! 
Gonna post this to /r/ukpolitics and see how controversial it becomes...
Throwing the book to see what sticks you think?
Well then why are some people allowed to talk about strip clubs here and others are not?
Non stop in the chat, that‚Äôs all he was responding to
Good luck buddy!
Thanks man. Thought that counts.
The girl on the right got glass stuck in her leg poor girl

Meet me in the parking lot after school, tough guy. Bring your guns.

Before the camera was on him, he noticed the atrocious fake jersey on the nimrod beside him. 
Oh, the horror! We must defend the honor of Lord [NAME] against the scum of r/NFL!!
Damn, you're good a parkour. That was a pretty giant leap to be made.
I'm from the UK, I thought you must have been joking. Queen were the height of cool at several points in their career.
A fatass? Look at him. You think he cares about his appearance? He‚Äôs likely talking about alcohol anyway.
My man's on the left looks like he's trying too guard precious
Is it my personal responsability if I was scarred for life due to abuse as a child ? IS IT?
I didn't believe it until I saw a video with creepy music. CREEPY. MUSIC. That's when my eyes were opened.
I love how nobody posting here to decry the buzzfeed article is using their actual accounts, they‚Äôre all throwaways. Cowards. Just like your felonious President.
Ah sorry about that won‚Äôt happen again
Glad I wasn‚Äôt the only who noticed. Annoyed me slightly.
Oh, in high school history facts change after every election.
it's hurting my heart :( why did you leave me
I feel like [NAME] will have a great bounce back game tonight
People love him on Yelp:-)
The only place open for dinner in our part of Seoul during Chuseok was a mediocre Chinese restaurant around the corner from our hotel.
The transit will be rapid until it, too, becomes bogged down by stops on every other block.
Anyone else think [NAME] kind of reminds them of [NAME]?
I really appreciate this perspective, man.
[NAME] fantasy world is way too fast for anyone in the original megaman but kill them all without using the force.
Then you're saying its about looks, not the misogyny.
Not loving what I'm seeing so far, let's hope we can tighten it up.
Thank god. The capitalists are the most virtuous among us.
It's simple, he's blunt, and that is what some people need.
You forgot some hyper text transfer protocols there buddy.
It means France. [NAME] is a guy from Paris.

Did anybody else noticed the mom right at the end hand gesturing the boy annoyingly as if it had been his fault?!
ahh [NAME] know you are well known people sooo...this isnt good thing
I'm thankful every day I was in school before the Internet, smart phones and social media.
Do they not remember the SRO who responded to a school shooting returning fire in under a minute.
"Until The Times can write another article on the theme ""They'll cave completely right now""."
Gratzy-Gratzy. You have a brought a great joy to this old Italian stereotype.

Your girlfriend is a woman of culture.
I did it. Lol.
This is my bestie's favorite song.
[NAME] looks like fat [NAME] lmao
Thank fuck they died... I mean rip, so sad üí≠üôè
Speak for yourself. Our defense crumbled under incompetency despite the talent they had to work with.
To give him a chance to play somewhere else. Sounds like a decent move by [NAME].
I'm familiar with his generation. Weren't many folks that had it that good.
Spot on.
36 and definitely not what I used to be... still ok though!!!
I have seen the movie Nosferatu. Believe it or not, I wasn‚Äôt even born when it was released!
Alright, thanks for that tip! <3
What a legend. True spidey meme master
Hahaha so I‚Äôm no longer going to worry about it then lol
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, and glad there are folks in the media that recognize this
She's aggressive in every TLJ fight. She even bullied that poor homeless man.
You naughty racist! Your use of logic and facts has been noted and you will be thrashed repeatedly with a rolled-up copy of the Guardian until you repent.
Home field advantage is barely a thing lmao also I hate the Patriots, you're just being an idiot.
No offense but...she's not pretty either so I'm confused why she'd say that car is only for ugly women.
"In ""modern"" copies of MGS 3, you can find a way to play music out of it that they can?"

Lol those stretch marks are from when I was obese...
The fact this isn't a [NAME] Attorney at Law Gif about this makes me kinda sad.
I am so sorry. My kids are the only thing keeping me going. The loneliness is agony.
It's very rare that I have literally no idea who a player is, but here's one.
For unrelated reasons, school is another mess. But vaccine injury in definitely represented through absurd levels of special ed. 
I like how this story's problem is literally the opposite of the next oldest post on this subreddit
The people I have heard from say [NAME] was a [NAME]. They will miss him but are still not willing to speak poorly of [NAME].
Imagine not using metric and celsius.
How many times do you have to watch The Office. lol!

Ohhh, thank you for enlightening me üòÇüòÇ
Dude, I'm happy for you. Keep going, you're doing great!

My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes 
Sweet home alabama No but for real, is that even legal? You should stop having sex with her.
> neckbeards come out in droves defending their undeveloped/deformed masculinity. You're a disingenuous cunt.
I know many progressives who don‚Äôt apply to that community. My father wants progressive economic reform in the U.S but thinks feminism is cancer
Glad those underprivileged West Loop kids will finally have something nice to take advantage of.
If only [NAME] was a being of infinite wisdom that could see beyond space and time and know this was going to happen.
people have built such a stigma around it that it's what comes to mind first instead of positive thoughts.
I like where you‚Äôre going with this....
I'm surprised they play the national anthem at derby bouts there, been to many bouts in Minnesota and haven't once heard the national anthem performed.
Lmfao lonzo? That guy is not nba talent. World is gonna spank that ass
new genders about to drop doesn‚Äôt strike me as a bad joke tbh.

In Mekkkah's latest pitfall video, he describes the common bad habit new Fire Emblem players have of _________.
Can confirm. All my friends in cork always do it while I get stuck waiting.
Wow, you really need a break. Maybe men just aren't for you.
The current situation is one of cronyism, it doesn't represent a few market, which has other tools to deal with such things.
[NAME] I hope so.
Omg didn't even think of that! So clever! Yes!
[NAME], people always forget about him but he has saved Madrid countless times in so many different ways.
Its interesting how it's become so mythologised and based on a large mount of fiction (tanks on the streets, English soldiers) 
They definitely do They wouldn‚Äôt play something else then
[NAME] loves his Starbucks!
Sure, but I don't think the fan culture derives from them.
Are you implying that I can not determine guilt by seeing a person's skin color and tense smile, you fucking racist?
Right its not because they look ugly but their personality is ugly. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving everyone away.
Or just shoot them. Shooting annoying people is why guns exist.
Such a beautiful smile! I can tell from your eyes that you‚Äôre a good person, and very sweet. I hope life treats you well.
No fuck that guy. I'm actually relived he was shot. Sounds like a sack of human garbage
Is it something you run into commonly with older adults? Sounds like in some ways it may make your job easier. Thanks for your work!
Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say
You‚Äôre an asshole.
I see Barca fans saying [NAME] is better and I can't help but laugh.
I already know what they're dealing with, i just cant help without hurting them emotionally or lying to them
"Same here. But I thought ""[NAME]"" is a fitting name."
The lying little slag. If you're squatting properly, turning your neck shouldn't be comfortable enough to consider
Is that a TV or a computer monitor ? :O
I made the mistake of choosing [NAME] once. I'm literaly unable to change characters in Tekken for the rest of my life.
Stop, your hurting me!
any therapist will tell you emotions are valid even if they are irrational. Which i think is one problem with many TiMs.
Talk about an oldddd school shit coin.
>would of ......
Racism. They're talking about racism. The hate is the new KKK sheet.
YES. Thanks man. Now I can feel less weird about my 20-year long passive aggressive rivalry with my sister. That means a lot.
Right now it's >you're dead ***or else completely reliant on maybe getting help via violent redistribution***. You only think that's better because of your fetish.
[NAME] has been somehow worse than [NAME] so far. Do we have any other subs who couldve played as wingers?
Lots of community theaters have great programs. What part of the valley are you in?
I wear pantyliners mostly every day now due to my random spotting, it helps but I feel the odor is seeping through my clothes. Thanks for the suggestion
That's still crazy to me as it's the same price online and in store here. We just have a flat rate.
Sad thing is, I wanted to, but I‚Äôm stupidly awkward...
Welcome to playoff hockey
When I was a kid I had the biggest crush on [NAME] from Footballer's Wives. She's hard as hell now.
This kinda looks like something shot in the style of Reno 911. Especially the bit where the cops look back and simultaneously say ‚ÄúJaywalking!‚Äù
The first story in the history of humanity.
Never more have I felt like I come from a British colony.
That IS crazy!
Actually it wasn't punishment, the teacher just didn't have any better assignments, so they thought that'd make the students busy enough
Foooooooor shadowing!
So can we all collectively accept that [NAME] has a high placement for this week? Okay thank you
Peering into the void Out of the abyss Something stirs Terrible secrets _____ Hope is lost Once it wakes [NAME] is dead
The worst bbq in Texas Edit: Some of you are getting seriously r/wooooshed It's their slogan.
No thanks.
I love all the cast in the later seasons, but the [NAME] relationship in seasons 2-4 are prime.
That's false
I did not know those were a thing. I need to get one for my pain meds.
I have no friends.
And sing the beat !
Canaryproject.org is great. They hold people accountable for saying horrible racist things.
I'm sorry. Now my entire bad pun looks even worse than it did when I started.
Ooooh, is that also an aspie thing? I have a lot of those moments here... 
Thanks! Thank you for sharing!
I read this to my 17 year old brother and he was kinda pissed off just saying
Enjoyphoenix couple of products are different than Desi‚Äôs box but it‚Äôs still existing products.
It's like Guatemala, but instead of the US it's Mexico... disgusting 
noun flogging or beating, either as a religious discipline or for sexual gratification.
I‚Äôd throw it back in for sure üëçüèº üé£
It's the number one reason I refuse to exercise.
This looks unnaturally fake
Loathing Big Pharma has nothing to do with being anti-vax.
I am generally a happy person. If you like to pay millions of dollars to semi-literates to represent your government, it's up to you!
my screen is 10 years old so the graphics are also horrible
[NAME] I LOVE YOU
Tell them I was born autistic.
Unfortunately, we do not routinely keep 20 liters of fentanyl in the pharmacy,
She didn't hit any of the notes but I still love [NAME] so much.
If I ever feel like getting shot... I am going to use this line. Thanks!
Is this [NAME] brother??
Dude, if this was real you wouldn't have mentioned godfather. 
wow thanks for the explanation. it's been like 3 hours and still looks like this
felt like that shot by palms was our first in a while
Pacific Daydream but with the instrumentation of this album would‚Äôve been way better now that I‚Äôm hearing this
At least you get sunny on Netflix, they took it off in Canada :(
[NAME] fuck my brain hurts, way to early for this shit. Sorry in advance if English is a 2nd language 
Games back on.
Does that caption say [NAME] and [NAME] are planning to move to Austin....? Dear [NAME] PLEASE no we already have [NAME]!
Honestly? No. I just feel sad for you guys
Boom! Thank you I‚Äôm going to check out your Channel
Yea, and trading away young players does not make us better.
I believe this is called Darwinism - the suicide by Tide pods anyways. The murder part with the blindfolds is just tragic.
Well he's a mod here, so he can get away with this shit.
#Go Knights Go!!
Women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies. They are conscious when their fetuses are not. Their priorities matter more in these situations.
If they really were silk that would at least be something.
Thanks <3
I'm just curious. I don't have anyone in mind rn. Just wanted to know if there are some cues
Depends of the raise pre and your stack and your opponent and your range and what you last ate
All the scumbags around everywhere. Sucks that it's so easy to use for a lot of other things.
It seriously is impressive to wake up and see Clemson fans taking full blown hay makers at all of their competition at once.
"50% of this sub is ""lul u don't have sex"""
I'm working in a creative industry; you'd probably fair well.
I wonder how she would respond if he said this. It's almost worth doing to find out.... Almost
"Color me surprised. Take your ""free"" care and like it, peon!"
That is not how that all went down. Good story though.
Then feel free to link to that data rather than politico.
Yeah, what do you know about her? Her Wikipedia page is pretty barren.
Oh no! Poor dude!
Only the fools would call Saigon the Pear of the Orient, haha. Stop sleeping on the past too much. And stop betraying your country
Lawyer up bro and report him!
Read this in the voice of that baclground janitor guy who [NAME] loves from rick and morty.
His tail?
Death approaches! -[NAME] 2013 (I think)
This guy is a little turd but I love him so dearly. I'll pass on your kisses :)
I had to watch x3 to make sure I didn't miss something üòÇ
uh, i don't see the correlation between tons of rape and murders in Georgia and the rich needing to be taxed more, but i do agree.
What a nice moment. Being in nature is super helpful to me for these moments :)
I love this. Just be racist against everyone and then it's fine!
You people really overestimate how much welfare actually covers. You act like one child is making six figures and giving their entire family an MTV Cribs lifestyle.
brooks running shoes and you will never have a sore back or feet in your life again
Yeah tis marketing tweet from the melbourne AFLW team about their captain seems like marketing being pushed down my throat. You woke af.
beautiful by [NAME]
I will take it... for free of course /s
Then you get home and realise they managed to bill you for the booze. That's half your winnings gone.
[NAME] combat is terrible and the only reason I don‚Äôt play it anymore
This literally broke my heart
Great game, great soundtrack. He was like 19 or 20 when he did that too.
It hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Just talk to the supervisor or HR. In the meantime don‚Äôt borrow trouble.
It‚Äôs always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they‚Äôre on camera
Somebody wanted these people to burn to death.
Didnt even know that was a thing.. yeah well ill probably never be a public figure so it doesnt really matter i guess lol
Yes, because private matches are a thing. Surprised no one else has mentioned that one.
Omg, you are so right! ü§Æ
[NAME] wants to murder all men. She believes all of them are deserving of death.
*Most of us are happy to help.
[NAME] I wish that were me
I'd say the key difference is probably vegemite consumption...
This can't be serious right? Already 14930 supporters have signed this crap!
This happens in America as well. Unfortunately the news cycle isn't interested in reporting such things. Just doom and gloom.
This is such a good idea!!
I just looked for this sub so I could comment on how great he is.
gotta love some Detroit Sports
[NAME] got bigger plans ahead from the looks of it. I see [NAME] in the senate if any democrat has a chance in Texas.
That's exactly why I think it would be a bad idea to scrap the program wholesale. Though, I still think that stadium is ludicrous. 
It's a perfectly cromulent scene.
<3 [NAME]. You were too good for this world.
You're not the only one. I for one feel stupid for thinking 100t shouldnt be having problems with such an easy pool
88 but top 2 in the division since it‚Äôll be competitive
> If it was a nationalist reaction to globalism, it was English nationalism, not British. This was and is discussed way too little.
So do I, but I don‚Äôt want them to be associated with government espionage and other shady shit either.
I did misread i saw 23-27
Idk how to use any.... the 5th one looks scary
This is honestly the cherry on top of the cake with this story. That's absolutely hilarious!
Bless. You will, friend. You see it already. 
Already taken haha
And here I am, with no promotion after 3 years. Anyways, congrats for yours.
..... That would seem like the ultimate way to get rejected and never spoken to again.
The point is, 9gag is more focused in providing fun and entertainment, Reddit is too busy changing the world.
LOL THEY DIED? like if you get reference
I carry on an empty. But I also carry a single action. So don't make my mistakes.
because you are in danger of appropriating methhead culture.
[NAME] not calling anything so far. Means they will call everything second half. It‚Äôs inevitable.
Spoiler: you might be depressed, go find out if you are, then come back.
That's a good policy.
This comment is way too far down. It should be the top comment.
Muzzle control.
I can‚Äôt figure out how to PM you but I have a question about something on another post. Mom of 2 here. üòÇ
"I've tried the ""peanut butter""...I almost vomited. NASTY! It went straight to the trash."
Big thanks to OP for that magnificent wall. I guess that we can reopen the government now.
Reminds me of my favorite [NAME] post
Keep working at it with your partner. I hope it all works out for you.
It was only a matter of time
Yeah they paid for my dinner but still ugh
That's what happens to you when you support terrorists (pkk) especially Marxist ones
Whaaaaaaat the heck was that?
And yet nobody bat an eyelid when it was [NAME] who was palling around with [NAME]. I wonder why.
I've had them for as long as I can remember ;)
Heart of darkness
You are welcome! Love to you on the journey!
There have been some really good replies in this thread, I hope they help you too! :)
What absolute garbage
You‚Äôre welcome! It‚Äôll absolutely be worth it. And it‚Äôll be fun! :D
Thank you for making this guide.
Oh I know just bantz
His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
That was great, especially as your first video.
[NAME]? Because [NAME] will def be in the white house.
I personally took this of his snapchat.... [lmfao
Optimism and emotions got us into this mess in the first place ffs. At least clarify why you are optimistic.
Our performance was an embarrassment and should never have happened. It's a bottom of the league style performance against top.
Had a whole grilled lamb at an Indian restaurant once for a corporate event. It was amazing
Fool me once, shame on you...
So true, their track record isn't great. Feels like you can only play her in limited ways or die though.
Mine was the size of my pinky. And honestly get any size you want! Just be mindful of your pain tolerance
Quite surprised I wasn‚Äôt on there
Omg I could cry at this
This submission was removed for breaking rule 7. This topic has already been posted, please search.
Oooh I haven't heard of that one. I'll look around.
[NAME] family must be having a field day there today!
Man, this is awesome but seems bittersweet after NYE. It was loud as hell.
Wow, 5 downvotes in 3 minutes. Go you!
I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly happened. I'm sorry you're having these problems. üôÅ
Tbf having an orgasm at his age could cause one.
That definitely hurt
YOUR momentum doesn't help you, its the direction you're aiming and THEIR momentum that does. they were probably backing up when that happened.
How dumb haha
Useful distinction - thank you.
Sooooo much upper body strength. My GOD the muscles. He's positively rrrrrrrripped!!
Hahaha love it
Good luck on the change.
Absolutely. If we plan on doing nothing, I‚Äôd be content buying myself some flowers and spending a night in taking care of my own business. 
whachu mean? I dont understand what being turkish does to ones character
4chan is brigading her video.
PM me if you need more info. Good luck! Its tough haha
But how can someone not be gender critical and yet claim to be a radical feminist? I‚Äôm genuinely confused.
nearly choked on my chicken breast
Yes. He was. Fuck off with your bullshit double standards.
Stay right there, I‚Äôm gona try it right now and report back
Or wait a few more weeks and try to snag one on sale after St. Paddy's
I can say the same for yours
Don't worry, no one ever will 
[NAME] was a [NAME]. He's on your people.
Oh, the boat was already on its way out lol
You're really stupid if you believe that.
"I don't always do this, but when I do, I'm listening to the unedited version of ""Killing In The Name Of""."
now this is epic
Thanks a lot, [NAME]. Now I've lost my train of thought!
That‚Äôs v strange behaviour.
Thanks! I was actually considering that myself, but I'm scared that I'll just start rambling about it 
The point is no 13yr old is perfect and shit happens that doesn't mean they were scumbags that deserved to die for making the wrong choice.
muscle-y shirtless man in a kilt handling balls. guys like guys that can handle their balls and heavy loads.
Seriously. Where I‚Äôm from it‚Äôs Heinz or excommunication.
It's not, and that's a much more engrained problem. Let's not let this one take hold.
Block the number, avoid your parents, and cut the toxic people out of your life.
That‚Äôs downright creepy. It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs testing if $50 will keep you quiet if he does inappropriate things.
Try to keep yourself busy with other things to forget the thoughts.
Etiquette Try to keep a positive attitude.
Because physical contact promotes bonding. Healthy relationships increase both partner's wellbeing. Routine can be frustrating. Especially when you want to try something new.
Sounds weird but dont swallow
This is really cool and well made!
your mom is safe when she bangs me she makes me wear a condom so she doesn't get preggers
this is good. well done.
This is the most adorable thing I've seen in a long time. I hope the intro went well.
but it's [NAME] saying it so sorta disappointing
R&M is still a good show but it's fans have driven it to Fortnite levels of annoyance.
Hope he enjoys the ticket he is going to get.
There seems to a bet between [NAME] and [NAME] whose semi final match would be more of a bloodbath
Using an argument based on intolerance is frankly a bad strategic idea and borders on offensive. It won't persuade anybody and it sounds ridiculous.
This type of discussion is exactly what I came to r/medicine for. Thanks guys!
Basically he is trying to start something based on a lie, not good. If I were you, I wouldn't see this person again.
To be fair, they did call it a horror. 
Yeah, and in Brazil we write only in cursive so I don't get those people.
I mean, he had to deal with [NAME] too! He doesn't deserve this...
01/11/19 - pretty easy to remember as it is the day my band released it's first full length record. The release day gig was also pretty neat!
We need more people like you. We need a batman who specifically harasses fat people.
Why? That's not helping us win games.
Lmao okay fatty
Thanks, I'll have a look and see what they offer
That was what was most nauseating for me honestly. Not a single period used once.
I‚Äôm sorry :(
Did you watch highlights of [NAME] vs [NAME]? [NAME] had amazing highlights but he isn‚Äôt the one competing for the Hart trophy now.
damn, i always get in on these too late
*DRAINS, CLOGS, BACKED UP LOGS [NAME]!* *OH, NO, TOILET OVERFLOW [NAME]!*
This sounds like a great idea!
oof I hope he didn't break his arms landing like that
I‚Äôm sorry there was trouble, but I‚Äôm glad it ended as okay as it did.
It‚Äôs all good. You do you. I get pissed and overreact all the time.
Thank you for this! :)
now blake's threes decide to drop lol it be like that sometimes
But the guage isn't usable in matchmaking and all items, including smash balls are typically off.
Oh my bad hahaha
just wait till [NAME] gets his less than 10 years deal.
If he was from a free pack he's not sellable, sorry
This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
Hahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ this is so funny and relatable!
[NAME] having a horrible night
Absolutely true. Sit down to pee at home, the splashback is real. Especially if you're tall. 
And KAT with 6. Weird game.
My #1
We are. EU regulations, laws created by the European Parliament. Don't say something that is blatantly untrue
I love [NAME]
They‚Äôve made it far more serious than necessary by a landslide!!!!!!
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.
You will never have as many girls interested in you as when you have a girlfriend. They can smell it
Brave move. Congrats and best of luck.
iT cAn'T bE sExISt bEcAuSE iT's a mErItocRaCy. -tech bro assholes justifying gender discrimination and systemic sexism
So [NAME] doesn't do the social media anymore? Is the NSP stuff enough without a GG salary now?
Depends on this being a small town or not.
My man loves his beer more than anything in the world.
How comes when Chinese companies help build infrastructure in Germany it's a terrible risk to their sovereignty yet this is fine
Most likely they're making their money from the monthly fee. So they don't care when you cancel.
This isn't really petty, it's actually brutal. *edit* but well done. I love it!
Not cool Op...not cool...
"I'd have responded ""no problem,I'll just return it"" "
Nah hes just setting an image.. Hes backed by ps to play this tourny...
But [NAME]
Fantastic, good for [NAME] white. Poor [NAME].
Thanks, I find your poor implementation of punctuation to be very amusing. It's good that there's something we can enjoy about each other.
My pleasure. It pays the bills.
She's gentle the mum says even tho the kid is stomping on a dolls head ye more like insane
Yikes ... that's a bad one. Thanks, and good catch.
It's shameful how this sub sold out to Big Broccoli (TM).
I wonder if the formal letter from the psychiatrist will help if cops just decide to shoot her first :(
That's a lovely thought, really awesome of you. Don't know personally but you could try contacting the Seoul International Women's Association (SIWA).
I would think I was in a horror movie and lock the doors. Lol
Sphh, that was badass. I say that went well.
Im in!
Thank you. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
Please don't promote your channel
Yeah, people die in civil wars. Stop.acting like the [NAME] are just killing [NAME] while spouting made up numbers
It kind of was for some people.
Ah gotcha, lemme move it. New to this reddit stuffs 
[NAME] office just denied it
I love being down by 10+ constantly.... I feel like [NAME] gets dominated by literally everyone.
I'm so sorry. She's a very lucky cat to have people who love her so much.
I would give r/momforaminute a visit, the people over there are fantastic and I think they can give you some comfort 
Resisting not being under arrest? What?
Thank you. Ignore the morons who have never heard of lactose intolerance.
Oh I can feel the burn all the way from Australia, even a few months later. Doesn't anyone have a direct source to this post? Thanks
Oh the irony of the sweater she's wearing.
I‚Äôm not crying! You‚Äôre crying!
Your title is unnecessarily harsh towards the user. Re-submit with a better title.
Wow. Uh...good luck.
Tell her to stop being so fat, then. Edit: /s
It's likely that they don't have much, yet still make poor financial decisions.
My biggest question is: who is [NAME]? Also: who are the [NAME]? Also: who is [NAME]?
"Sounds like another data point for ""fear homo Sapiens"", haha. "
Man this sucks. Hope you‚Äôre enjoying life in a big house with lambs!
This is a good change. I've heard too many sad stories on Tinder about this sort of thing, looking for a way out. 
We don't have this problem where I live, we use Torrents 
"My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung."
Yeah, even though I give it to him that it was confusing that they designed Crysis 1 for PCs that wouldn't come out for like 5 years.
Go away with your good reason and good arguments and stats and facts. This sub is all about blind fanboyism about [NAME] and [NAME].
Thanks for clarifying!
I'm a PR and I've been lucky enough to have millions in capital and that is ALL the statue states.
Not sure what carrier you have but TMobile has a pretty damn good scam call blocker included in their plans.
Please treat me with modern medicine. I have gastroparisis.

I love how happy the dog looks in this pic. üòä
Well thats a rare opinion of Earth X.
Go ahead and take them panties off too, we need this OT goal.
AMAZING!! I can‚Äôt wait for your talking head!
Aim assists + people in console are used to this type of guns cuz like u said [NAME] or any popular shooter in console
Congratulations! One day you‚Äôll look back on this and laugh. It‚Äôs the best thing you‚Äôve ever done.
WE ARE NOT FACEBOOK
wow just shows how confused **I** was Ftfy Pretty fucking clear as day what was going on here lol I honestly don't know what to tell you
That's the key- minor corrections, little improvements, something slightly different.
*price hike for [NAME] only. I dropped Netflix last month because of it.
I hope they remain long time friends and can look back on this as adults and have a nice giggle together
Thanks. Those are great suggestions.
Keep watching!
I was born in ‚Äò98 so I feel like your ‚Äò98 loss is my ‚Äò09 loss.
That was 1 scene and I think was more about her sense of powerlessness in the situation
yes, i can imagine they are busy,then add in personnel things such as emotion,wake,funeral etc
It‚Äôs the format. It‚Äôs like one of those bad [NAME] memes
[NAME] is not a guy I root against. Just hope we have a good enjoyable game
Where is the discusting from?
I'm scared for her. The Saudi government has proven to be very brazen in its disrespect for international law.
It worked once already.
162 Again, for the 7th straight year. Like usual lol
You have to put food on the table, so take the job you need to do so. Look for others while working to find the right job.
Naw man Asain men have an easier time. Most of my asain friend are pretty boy. Fuckbois lol
You live in a wonderful fantasy world where all the students will pretend they are not adolescents with raging hormones. Charming.
Be the change you want to see in the world!
This is actually one of the most retarded things I‚Äôve ever seen. Good post op
[NAME] a drama queen?! Surely you jest./s
I've used tofu and nutritional yeast before. It works well for ricotta! Recipe here!
I love Nigeria, visited a couple of times. Lived in Angola for two years
Ok. You‚Äôre just being silly now. Good night.
Happy cake day!!!
Would love to see them both in the same side
> ftw Awesome statistic. Made my day! Love it
I absolutely love him. He is one of the two people that I enjoy playing. He has one of the most unique move sets and I like that
Lmao what a guy
wait, no more [NAME] SJW pwned vids in my recommended? YOU DARE DISGRACE OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR?
> why have all of my responses been restating my opinion Because you're cruising on righteous indignation rather than empirical evidence. Facts don't care about your feelings.
"""I have to deal with this, so now you have to also."" "
I'm also enjoying it I like mixing the colors the most.
Ah. Okay. Good luck with work tomorrow.
Don't cope
Nooooo r/trollGC is for memes Check out r/goodnewsforwomen if you want happy news
I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience.
Yay we start off with the love triangle!
It does mean they are parroting it when they say the **same exact thing, word for word**.
Oh, but it is.
I am bored of [NAME]. Next celebrity chef!
Same. Right after I replaced the screen. So now I have a cracked phone
You know what that means... ...**[NAME] IS IN [NAME] BOX**
30 bombs won‚Äôt be enough for me to feel good running [NAME] and his career .291 OBP out there every day
Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.
Thank you so much.
I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship!
Agreed. A case where we're both right. Cheers!
You know I asked once and he was livid. But sometimes I wonder.
It's back up now. Sorry for the mess with moderation, wasn't our fault.
I wasn‚Äôt expecting that tbh
thanks a ton!
oh trae turnover then a whistle looks like LP gonna show him the bench :|
That was a fluid motion and it scared me
What. The. Fuck.
Fake was the right call either way.
Got to love all the fake fans that know nothing about hockey!
I feel you. Most look generic af. I've seen some absolutely stunning ones though. Like [NAME]. She's a 10/10 IMO.
so kids never go into a locker room and see adults nude?? i cant believe everyone is condemning this. this is nothing.
You're a bad person, but a great [NAME].
Ooh, and they make the joke be able to be known by everyone so viewer thinks they are special
That's an estimate that doesn't include the fees to his organizations. You just said literally what OP said divided by 5.
I hate deer. Damn big assed rats
Thank you for not making a cake day shit post
It‚Äôs comments like these that always make me question whether or not technology is a curse.
Tell that to korea
Haha I know the guy in the middle of the picture. Small world
"I think OP said teacher in correlation to how he was using the word ""lesson."" I don't think they were an actual teacher."
Lmao that‚Äôs so true
Lets just say I'm hopeful! Don't die on me [NAME].
Haha, not really on a budget, I like the ground turkey suggestion above!
Possibly cool idea not well thought out
damn you were close
We need mark-ass brownlee
Sounds like a problem with how you are playing, not with the perk.
i wish i wasn‚Äôt a failure of a person.
I just saw this on netflix..... Now I'm Watching it... Then you post this.... It's like we almost watched it together...
Pleasure to meet you brother
You'll be in for a shock in another couple months.
Also, popcorn can't build ladders. At least, I don't think so...
I love the downvote followed by zero response. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, goodnight *mic drop 
That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
I don't disagree with anything there.
Might get in trouble with the mother for assuming she's single though. This has happened to me when using miss.
I still can't believe that dude in Whangarei is still allowed to run his business. I wonder how much longer he will keep it up.
Free weed lol don't get what you're complaining about.
Having this issue as well it really does me in
For futures sake, if someone is in the Midwest, where would we opt to play? 
That is insanity
Man I hate kids
What an absolute moron. Talking about characters everyone and their inbred mother knew would be back. His stupidity fucked him over.
Their roster just doesn‚Äôt work, sadly they didn‚Äôt realize it in time.
Does Mama count?
Thanks for not running our prospects in the Pre-Season anymore!
I'm honestly so pissed off for you. That whole situation is insane. Good luck moving on. No one deserves to be treated like that.
True. Edit: Maybe my only issue is the misuse of funds. Like that couple that went to Vegas and put the homeless guy in a trailer.
Finally! Now I see what I was doing wrong. PB, thank you!
How embarrassing.
Missed the beginning of the game, cheers or boos for [NAME]? I'm assuming cheers, but you never know in MTL
He‚Äôs going to the Bengals at 11 and I hate it so much
"Maybe one ""episode"", but they're definitely going to go Part 1 and Part 2 on the third act."
Where ever they found [NAME] and [NAME]. It's like a pool of douche bags with underlaying anger issues. Scary AF
NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
Sorry if Im slow here but what does Milan or [NAME] have to do with this? Hes going to Inter or Arsenal,no?
He is just awful enough to do something like that.
I love the book - much better than the movie imo!
No. That is creepy and weird. If you don‚Äôt trust her .... move on.
My same thoughts! Post this there and see what options you have! That is unbelieveable your dad would do that!
Go look up China‚Äôs virtual news anchor.

His character was created to be a love interest and it's literally the only thing they know how to use him for.
As opposed to?
Thank you! That‚Äôs good to hear. I like presenting the place as it is.
Yea sounds like a great way to teach your children that stalking and harrassing = love. Husband only hits you bc he loves you!
Whistler Medical, Broken Coast, and 7 Acres... looks to be the top 3 rec producers right now.

The lease ends on September 9th. I can hold out until then, it‚Äôs just going to suck. 
Feed this mans!
Yeah, and I always thought the dude in these comics was supposed to be like 30 years old. 
Worse than selling your soule
Exceptions prove rules
Also op I have my associates on top of my bachelors? Whatchu mean
That was horrible defending what the hell
I agree with the concealer part for the cut crease but that's it.
`Omnialternative` Thanks, I hate it.
I hate Detroit
It's just you. Nobody has ever noticed. Except this and [this person.
Is this also where I brag about the fact that I‚Äôm gonna get laid too?
For a second I thought he was on shrooms
The edit... what? Why is he playing on an account that was registered by someone else?
trust me, you do not want to do this. i used to live with 2 party people and it was absolute hell. save yourself now
I know it's possible, but you have to be wayyyy above average alpha type.
Maybe try online classes or even start with a Udemy class on writing? Would that help?
Left beer outside so I could make a cool picture for reddit. Please give karma.
I really like this ring so I‚Äôm glad to hear that.
Dude, you look fine bro. Even at 26 and still in school. You‚Äôre fine bro.
I'd get the call of the void way too hard here.
I look cuter in red P‚Äôs.
*right, [NAME]. thank you for clarifying.
That‚Äôs so wholesome.
OMG are you serious? Do you know what episode? That's horrendous! I'm really disappointed in [NAME] on that one.
How do you get locked up by [NAME] lol
This stresses me out way too much.
Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something.
Threatening to jail disadvantaged families is low even by Democrat standards.
That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. 
Thank you very much. I try my best to follow my steps from therapy, but it seems to be my biggest hurdle.
[NAME] follows me on Instagram so it's ok.
That's when you slow down and engage troll mode :))
Right, send them all to Mississippi.
Thank you for being the only person here to choose, not to be offended. This is a good burn. 
Oh man, I forgot about eBay! I have some old textbooks I‚Äôve been meaning to put on there too.
Nope, not my department.
You‚Äôre no welcome then. Get aff reddit.
I kill them all and THEN overwrite my only save. I'm bonkers.
And here I am thinking that the animation after surrender/Victory is annoying ;-;
I‚Äôm curious, do any other coaches do this?
Lmao, they are gonna have field day 
That's good eatin' mate.
Omg just drink some water then bro lol
In the shower, years after it's happened and everyone else has forgotten about it.
Ooof girl...I thought this was satire at first it was so cringe.
Nothing is wrong with hugs and love, but most adults need sleep too.
If this data were exportable in CSV format. I would love this website long time. (Github link for feature contributions maybe?)
You're not a good person if you make the person that just let you inside their body feel bad and disrespected.
this video makes me sad
No room. Get lost. I cc u!
>Shes completely self-made too :) Now I'm imagining her as some sort of entity that brings its own existence about
So cynical! üôÑ üòÇ
I don't blame you. It was a long post. Thanks for your time.
Fact, the sky is orange. And if you think it‚Äôs blue, you‚Äôre stupid
That's what everyone says but they are ugly. I want a Diavel, m109, or a Vrod.
I did nazi that coming!
You know, I‚Äôm something of a friend myself
Here‚Äôs hoping this ends soon lol
i mean i hate these takes that because we turned the ball over 26 times, the rotations werent a problem. They clearly were
They want to play the best team to learn the most.
Right now you‚Äôll be sober for at least 15 years! Good luck man
Some of them will have to get new vehicles to meet the requirements. That means we get cleaner air. Where's the problem exactly?
I think we all are
Glad to see [NAME] back
Also i think that person is really shitty and I‚Äôm sorry you experienced that. People are animals sometimes.
I'm sorry that's what you read because it isn't what I said.
Umm... Wooosh?
It‚Äôs simpler to prove that something exists than to prove that something has always existed, Occam is on my side lol
Definitely the second.
I think we would have tried to, but [NAME], as we can see, is way too good to make us a bottom 4 team.
If you like that I got one that you may like. makes me laugh everytime here
So one study on ten years of data in a chem unit/battalion and you're extrapolating that to the entire DoD?
This is the first person Australia has tried to do this to...
You have sound advice. Thank you. Another issue I have is this is an entire state away from us. A minimum 4 hour drive.
Thanks haha. I really do feel sorry for my friend here... At least the group he accidentally asked is pretty much all furries
I used to have a pet rat. She was the best pet I ever had.
I just love anybody thats fabulous
I met her once and she ended up falling for me.
I really enjoyed [NAME] and I feel him on a spiritual level
He wasn't in beta, he's just played over a thousand games apparently.
>I want to believe that everyone deserves love They absolutely do! And he loves himself enough already! Too much, in fact.
Yeah that look points to body dysmorphia to me
We have Medicare Medicaid and Obamacare
Win what exactly? A meaningless game in a very long season to be swept out of the playoffs? No thanks.
Sorry, not sorry, but this seems wrong and extremely disrespectful.
Weird... maybe he was offended that the store had security in the neighborhood because it was so nice. People baffle me.
Lmao everyone in this gif was absolutely clueless
[NAME] with [NAME] on him, [NAME] pulls up for three. Great
Yeah, assuming what he said is true yes he has a chance, but it's hard to say for sure given the circumstances 
Trading game items for crypto without middleman xdd
How ignorant do you have to be to not understand that [NAME] IS NOT ALT-RIGHT. HE PREACHES COMMON SENSE THAT NO ONE APPARENTLY ADHERES TO CLEARLY.
Sending you love ‚ù§Ô∏è
They've done this before. Look the Order of the White Feather up, it was worse.
I asked her before I told her. She took it on herself. I say NO all the time when I don't want to hear sadness and pain
Lightborn, [NAME] Demise, Look at a wall, Bait out the flashlight person, Slug. Wow, so hard.
We already had that fake news before. There's no such discussion.
"Give me an example of the discussions they are silencing with words like ""racist"" ""sexist"" and ""homophobe"""
Thanks a million, because I was very much thinking the opposite hahaha
Is this supposed to be funny? Psst, if you guys knew the reality behind this joke...
Hahaha exactly, and deciding on even the most simple of things
Worried about it escaping....now that's fresh food.
I like [NAME] because she hates America
Say what? I don't get the joke - is that the founder of the MLM? Are you talking sexually or financially *railed*?
[NAME] somehow guides Killie to both 2nd and 3rd place, this frees up an extra relegation spot and Hamilton are finally flushed. 
I hope to experience this beautiful rendition of bliss
Yeah, that‚Äôs where my friend saw cizikas as well. Hey [NAME], is that you? Lmao
What? Can anyone fill me in I‚Äôm confused lol
Alcohol makes ur body go limp so u don‚Äôt get hurt.

Crickets ü¶ó...
That's amazing that it had 3-4 years' worth of stored energy in the trunk.
Is that you [NAME]?
Yeah totally but she was mainly talking about [NAME] coming in and screaming, she wasn‚Äôt actually referencing their relationship
Ew, this comment needs to die. Adultery is the most cowardly option you could ever pick.
Some additional background the robo-voice on that video is horrible.
They actively supported it before *mysteriously* going silent about it during and after the 2015 Labour leadership election.
Can't wait for episode 5

You can't control if you're nervous or not, but just know that you will absolutely be judged for it. Consciously or subconsciously.
That would set an awful precedent Anytime the president can't pass something legislatively, he can just shut down the government to force his agenda through. 
I'm sure he immensely appreciates the gesture.
> they hardly ever land shots on you. Welcome to console shooters.
WHAT IS HAPPENING
He put some respect on [NAME] name tho.
I'M ON A HIIIIIIGHWAY TO HELL
Thank you...
Not with me, no. I‚Äôm a true social butterfly 
The first time I'm seeing it so thank you for sharing. Definitely shows the propaganda efforts.
I have, and now that you mention it, I think that's what triggered my nostalgia. 
[NAME] was the best, sweetest, most deep-feeling man to ever be on the show. I will fight anyone who says otherwise. 
Oh I thought we were talking about a sweaty sausage placed between two soggy white buns. Soooooo... yes.
They also have the best lemon bars!
He is nearly 25, can't shoot, can't dribble and does nothing great. He wont improve much.
I love u too <3
Damn... üòë
Hes not the best at communication which is a big red flag in my book
I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!
I love when [NAME] is a bit more bias with a call when [NAME] isn't. Always makes me giggle.
I like waitresses. Aren't they swell.
Thank you, have never been to a church and couldn‚Äôt have know it is called a pew.
I love this. It's not always the most exciting things that make for the most amazing feelings üòä
Patience. Give it another day or so. Send a text telling her you enjoyed her company and wanna do it again. Hopefully she responds
X+n is an even worse option for class caps, so you have pointed out that an old broken system is now more broken. Thanks. 
It makes me feel better about overeating sometimes because I tell myself that at least I‚Äôm not as bad as those people
Everybody poops.
I‚Äôm not a fan of that hire at all... I‚Äôm also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
That is the coolest name
I didn‚Äôt know [NAME] was in middle school! Is she really say crap like that as a grown woman? TLC created this monster!!
I‚Äôm glad
Plymouth: Confederate flags Diesel pick up trucks Dead factories Heart disease and disappointment
Ha you're hilarious. Upvoted
Dude, y'all anti American scum don't even believe in science. Fuck off with your generic bullshit because you can't list a specific example. 
I love this! üá¶üá∫
...be careful, guys
Well I mean he got erased from existence twice and is still here so I'm guessing it has to be something more than that.
Damn straight!
BITCOIN SEND MONEY INSTANTLY (waits 6 months to get money and still praises site)
They're upset because, if the slime that makes 4chan stink were to congeal into a person, it would be [NAME].
Seems in line with the marines trope.
THIS FOOKIN GAME
I felt the same guilt when I stopped believing in [NAME]
Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.
Different agencies, I guess. My agency would have the whole squad felony stopping these clowns.
I am sorry that you are experiencing such deep suffering and such pain. You matter in this world, and we would all be diminished without you.
Thanks bro means a lot
Yeah I have no idea. I‚Äôm guessing she meant to ask for someone to ‚Äúsit‚Äù with mama [NAME] in her place?
I do love the Baroque style as well! All the Church‚Äôs I ever saw in Mexico especially the cathedrals in are simply amazing.
You took the **bait**. Unless you masturbated to it.
[NAME] damn, she must fuckin‚Äô STINK.
Were you looking for a tall person
I honestly couldn‚Äôt care less about your opinion at this point
Barely attractive. Fify
I never used an escalator until I was about 16 and I still remember moving stairs scaring the hell out of me
That grammar though
If u see the show you would realize that swearengen it's motivating the journalist, everyone will run in to painful situations some give up, some fight back
"Birth Control or Condom. With this ""right moment on her cycle"" bs you're probably not going to be ""[NAME]"" in the near future."
"I wish they can a option to change it back after the ""upgrade"" because it feels more like a downgrade"
I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse.
I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.
You can't talk morality to psychopaths.
Lets go devils baby
I so remember that!
yeah, I've had the hardest time letting go of my exes. The last straw was when I found out they cheated.
How to get badly injured in a room full of foam.
IMO 90% of articles on the internet, or in newspapers or TV news, are placed by PR firms. Only children don't know this.
They'd be a 16 year old stoner or 61.
How could I not? These actors...I love them. Their faces give me joy, hope. 
It‚Äôs okay bro saints about to beat them 41-3 next week lmao don‚Äôt worry

Cool thanks for the reply. Always keen to learn from the actual people haha!
Every red light should have one of these!
Stop giving panhandlers money. They dont need it.
Doesn't matter, you don't deserve an advantage over everyone else just because you have a disability. Edit: Lol, downvoted for stating a fact.
yup it may be me!
Thanks for reply, I'll enjoy reading through the comments... maybe you make a book of it all. 
[NAME] is earning his spot
You'd think that's a simple game mode they'd have had from the start... I would have loved that.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different because I deserve it.‚Äù These same assholes in rural areas.
[NAME]? We have a friend in one of those condos on 19th.
I should have at your list that I only hope he gets elected!
Yes. Less toxic =/= nontoxic.
I appreciate this. I don't think I've given up on teaching entirely. I will try to survive!
That lone pube you forgot to take off in the corner lol
Calling a 40k salary a humblebrag is still pretty funny in a self-deprecating way.
Ah, I work 9-5 :( but I appreciate the invite!
Can I get a link to the discord? The pinned post isn‚Äôt working for me
I‚Äôd buy a cheap version of it.
[NAME] expunged my paraphernalia without consent and I called the **LAW TIGERS** to sue him for damages.
Unfortunately, on that we can agree.
I legit thought he was JSE for a second. I was so confused, but so happy all at the same time
I hope your brother is okay. Don‚Äôt listen to this guy, he‚Äôs a cunt.
I guess nobody cares about what you want.
At the discretion of NI, which is currently lacking any Assembly or proper representation. Good luck with that.
It is his welcome, he can do with it as he wishes. Your misunderstanding is forgiven.
I sure do.
> This is just a waste of time. Just like making portland denizens use their tax dollars to built a stadium
Wasnt meant to be rude at all.. more like that everything is going to be alright soon
Funny enough OP is a gooner
If I may suggest patience, if your data is still there, you might want to read a little before open heart surgery. 
Get it out of the way as quickly as possible. Some people claim to like it, so maybe you'll be one of those weirdos.
[NAME] is my main.
Just imagine what they'll come up with in ten years.
Cake! Happy days!
Yeah but it's fun lol. Hes banned a lot in NA also.
Get ready for another wasted season
This says more about what [NAME] thinks about facts than what's true about music.
I noticed a lot of times racists just try to bait people so you did the right thing.
Oh. For real? I stand corrected then. I haven't encountered that before. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That would be really great, but good luck.
Weird flex but ok
Downshifting in a manual to accelerate quicker
It‚Äôs one of my worst nightmares to have skin like that...I hope that person gets actual help
This is absolutely the proper place to post this.
Disclaimer: This is r/television not r/news. Sorry for the mistake.
this, from the good the bad and the ugly
I recognize this YouTube channel... They make beautiful furniture. This has to be at customer request. I have no idea how to explain it otherwise.
Title question: Obviously. As has already been mentioned in other threads this very day.
Wow! Never thought of it this way but that's a REALLY good point.
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
[NAME] is an awesome film school...not surprised this came from Dodge
I did that in origins but now that theres mercenaries and its sooo annoying to deal with them so i stay as quiet as i can until im caught.
Dude, I've gotta listen to Loveless again 
‚Äú[NAME], I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything‚Äù - [NAME]
Who should read?
Funny how we get more anxious about our heroes than their victims
yes. i hate being bored. it's the cause of much of my depression and anxiety.
She's a masochist and gets turned on by how inconvenienced she is
Maybe one is bigger than the other, so getting more t-time?
Thank-you very much, your comment is greatly appreciate.
Petulant child? No wonder he and [NAME] get along.
Project Exile worked pretty well, and it specifically targets criminals
That was one of the first thought I had too. Three!!
Lol I‚Äôm just joking the ‚Äúwe did our due diligence part‚Äù is prime lynch talk haha
Just stunning my meats
Let‚Äôs get greedy and take back what is rightfully ours
Here too. I just find weird colorful stuff and hope it doesn't clash too bad.
The customer‚Äôs a jerk but you‚Äôre really not very clear here.
Nah let's not be those people.
Maybe they just like having a day off- something that is rare in our culture.
Amazing bot, you‚Äôre doing great sweetie 
Waiting for both of these things is torture
You can be so much more specific when hitchhiking.
Super weird question. Not really commenting either way, just so weird the life we have created for modern humans.
Funny enough, there is a five guys. I don't think the government knows it's American.
I really havent found any of these so far that funny. Although his backflips and other stuff are pretty impressive
Sorry it was late at night. I fixed it.
lol, this is so much me, I'm actually loling and not just typing it. :D
Yeah they taste so fake!!
While the new Preds jerseys have grown on me a lot; I do looove Vegas' jerseys.
You wont bud. Do it, call it just to talk. You dont have to share anything.
It will be carefully tailored to piss their parents off, which I will enjoy greatly :-)
It's clear you dont know what you're talking about.
Pretty impressed that they have pork roll there tbh
^ And another baby bear. Prepping for a new propaganda assault?
IT'S NOT FUNNY HOLLY.
I didn‚Äôt know [NAME] disliked Pittsburgh so much
Since their job is to keep us safe, I would argue that it is very important.
While I agree that the biggest problem is [NAME], [NAME] had to go too.
P o R Z I n G I S
they will also hate the eagles for years to come because their fans were a bunch of meanies
Mate imagine reacting so poorly to be called out to calling anyone who has been discussing ozil and sven unreasonable.
I feel the exact same way. It makes me so insecure
I‚Äôm still not sure how we managed to do that. Gas prices in this state has gone up around 70 cents per gallon since around 2013
Same thing I thought haha
What do you mean?
I laughed. Finally
...and prone to paranoia and hatred of outsiders.
And now Episode 9 will be a hip meta-homage to Weekend at Bernie's where they try to pass off the franchise as being alive.
I love how she has no idea what to do. Like stop drop and roll ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Eh, we all pay for sex one way or another. More power to you.
Unpopular opinion: Let [NAME] take the open 3s so he can become a better stretch big.
Yum, I love a little pigeon mixed with my grain.
My experience has been the opposite. Younger guys are sweeter and try harder- without trying to wife me down. We just have fun together
This sub is becoming a ‚ÄúGamers rise up‚Äù parody of itself. This is ridiculous.
I often do this when I listen to metal. It helps vent some of the anger I feel.
Cheese Most of my friends love cheese so much that I‚Äôm scared to tell them that I can barely even bring myself to eat it
Daaaaang I bet he had a headache after that
Assassins Creed Odyssey is awesome, as well as Shadow of War. Both great adventure games.
I got the exact same message from tati yesterday ! She said on her twitter that it's definitely a scam
That sentence is wrong and the burn is a little obvious.
Just wanna say I love you and hope the flight and everything thing else goes wellüëåüëå.
You Done?
Xers and [NAME] would be more of age in the 90‚Äôs doh, signed [NAME]. 
I‚Äôm down for destruction at anytime. Destruction is my best friend! But hope you feel better, heart breaks do indeed suck. 
Sorry, I‚Äôm out of the loop- are they on this season as well? I forgot about them
Wow. I dig that.
Right now it sucks ass I gotta squat in snow in the freezing cold in the back yard of my apartment complex holding a little bong
I Play on ps4 so thats a Little uncomfortable but thanks
Oh there's still bugs? Weird
Can a lad please send me one of whatever the fuck this is plz.
Yikes on the sauce!!
Heart breaking* sorry haha
I came back to work and I found the charlkboard like this. No idea how it got that way. Weird.
I think we're passed the point where he'll ever have a full health season again
If [NAME] ever steps down, it seems like [NAME] would be the perfect replacement.
im pickle rick!!!!!!!!!!
Ice Cream or Tacos for me. Or the best of both worlds.... a ChocoTaco!
How to PRETEND to have ice powers? Wikihow, *do you think this is a fucking game?!*
[NAME] finally getting WCW going I see..
> whatever happened to MK9's revealing style? Female characters started getting treated as actual characters and not just strictly fanservice mannequins.
He would like to speak in third person.
They've provided plenty of evidence that you have only supported so far.
Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.
It‚Äôs too cold to go outside most of the year. Whining into webcams is all they‚Äôve got!
Oscars are trying to be more hip and contemporary now, so don't be surprised if [NAME] and [NAME] win. 
Meta. If you feel otherwise, please speak now, or forever hold your bow.
We‚Äôve also had ~10 shots and [NAME] first shot was not until the 40‚Äô mark.
He got cleared in that. She hit him over the head with a lamp and he basically violently restrained her
If you do, the defecation will impact the rotary oscillating atmospheric circulation device.
[NAME] is a jinx. Please send him back.
I think this is my favourite one ever.
It always reminds me of those really old SNL skits with [NAME] & [NAME]
I bet you could get away with this at work just fine.
We also thought about that :)! I'll try look for other options!
Loooong way to go in the season. A lot could happen. All we need is bottom 3 for a shot
As someone who is about to be 29 this is the realest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
[NAME] was born in Canada. Moved to Texas. We don't want credit for that melted brick of unsalted butter...
I would say they do because it was a horrible accident but they were also in the wrong. The military tried to get them to disperse they didnt.
Well the three games is all we have to go off of, and he was bad.
Abso-goddamn-lutely. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think of that can make otherwise rational people defend rape, murder, genocide and slavery. 
Currently cuddling the pillow because my husband got up...
Probably fans of aftv. Bunch of utterly dirty cunts!
I now understand why everybody gets pissed off at these weak ass pump fake fouls.
Lol, what?
I'm very glad too. She has been with me for twenty years now, so basically all my life.
UGH those two championship games - so many highs and lows then the ultimate high @ the end
Actually we win by realizing other fan bases have insane fans that are way overreacting to a blowout loss too.
"She always says the most basic things""wow he hit him"" and her lisp is pretty annoying."
I'm more saying that I think the south is a joke.
This is not a legal issue. Take it up with your school if you don't agree with it.
I don't play assassins much, but I love playing Rat.
"No. I'm against the idea that one can ""liberate"" farm animals in the same way we can liberate human societies."
[NAME], for when you want to be a healer but also want a FUCK EVERYONE AROUND ME button. Although I‚Äôve been maiming [NAME] recently.
Really not sure how that‚Äôs your takeaway.
So that's how people get their cars sideways in those crazy pictures. I'd always wondered.
Sadly the Request a Book of [RELIGION] requires a phone number now. But if you have theirs it might work;
To be fair it seems like we're in a month-long shutdown because a large portion of the feds are desperately tryjng to not build a wall.
Added you mate well I‚Äôve just got the bow and I love the hunting aspect of the game so happily join you hunting and what not
He's sick of people spelling his name wrong.
Marlins: [NAME], OF Wow talk about a blast from the past. I don‚Äôt remember him being so highly regarded as a prospect 
Glad to have you here :)
> one of the better diss tracks out there Lol okay
That's amazing
just doesnt make sense... almost 30, already played in La Liga and they likely could have had him at any time he was there.
I did this with [NAME] to troll my friend who drafted him in a dynasty league about making bad picks. 10/10 would do again
What's does the future hold for you two? You're not happy with him. You deserve better.
For a long time he had no experience of going to the later rounds. Now that he has been there, he hopefully knows better than to be wasteful
I don't think a player can have no value and also be worth rioting over if he's traded.
He's been pretty open about their very legal and very cool bromance
How did [NAME] just give that beatdown to Attach, the other player was so far away.
I love those examples. Thank you for sharing. üôè
Nah, rest is pretty cringe too
Well it didn‚Äôt work that well, I mean... they lost
You can get blood from a tissue that's 3 weeks old to plant!
Hoping LSU can kill 2 minutes and 20 seconds of clock here and not let UCF score more...
Why the fuck do people have these conversations in public
They say this picture is magic. You see whatever your heart most desires.
Thank you for your post. I will always treat him the same
Ty for introducing me to The Barberettes, friend! The taste is *superb*
I‚Äôm curious as to how many people they‚Äôre going to interview for the OC job. Maybe 2-3?
I am embarrassed to admit that I was shocked to find out that his books all had the same exact weight and that you knew what that weight was...

[NAME] can get the web action, ja feel?
The Mavs are my 2nd favorite team and [NAME] is a baller. And this dude named [NAME] is having a nice season with the Wolves.
Big yikes. Biiiig yikes. I do feel your pain. I wish I could upvote you more than once.
EEEW as a strong manly man why would want any of that ^(^just ^push ^it ^down, ^push ^it ^down)
Terribly sad story. I loved it.
[NAME] and [NAME] were always goldmines. They had so little air time compared to the rest but whenever they were shown it was memorable
Had she gone into the left shoulder before braking she may have had a chance.
I‚Äôll just take this as an apology and bid you farewell AM x
Gahs that‚Äôs so sweet

I think its hilarious that you can't seem to understand the joke of the headline.
Wait, wut? I thought there was some sort of (2) term pledge from

The great ancap argument lol
Nice, I didn't know that! Thanks for the info.

Oh I never knew you could do that
I would never wish for someone to get injured, but an injury needs to happen at the Pro Bowl so they cancel it forever.
I'm not a real estate guy, but isn't it normal for rich people to buy nice houses in nice areas?
So [NAME] is really a fan of playing the bench vs the other team's starters at the end of halves. Really finding every tanking edge possible.
I always loved fighting [NAME] in Arkham Origins, he was really fun to fight, I‚Äôm still mad they did him dirty in Arkham Knight
I guessed that but I‚Äôve never seen a bun like that
I'm making small steps to change my life
My point is that we should fight the whole system, not a single hospital that does the best they can. 
Thank you. It is somewhat comforting to think this may be the real issue and not that she just doesn't want to with me anymore.
You are disregarding that the Iran hostage crisis happened just years early. Iran was public enemy number 2, second only to the Soviets.

I love this so much
Mf perioded on my new sofa
[NAME] fast asleep is adorable. I love how the two blonde girls are asleep and with drool.
When people say [NAME] should be an All star just show them that last possession
lol a milquetoast anarchist‚Äôs take on Marxism
you are fucking amazing. stay strong üíì
I like how submissive the coyote is being to this tiny little cat. Like, dude, you could just eat him.
Now excuse me while I go home with my briefcases full of money from alcohol and tobacco companies
Yeah, this. 
One of the most chillingly haunting places I have ever been to.
Other than ignoring [NAME] PTSD
Bravo, that looks beautiful. Though i know for a fact that i would find a way to fall face first on those things sticking out.
True, so just basically everyone. It needs to be easier to get a gun than it is now anyways
Tough scene for [NAME]
satisfying, really.
Sorry man, it's not gonna happen. The music needs to be remastered for vinyl specifically and that's more than your budget.
Completely, it makes it into a decent panel
You‚Äôre doing so good! We‚Äôre all so proud!
i thought the comment i replied too was still talking about the OP's vid. [NAME] should have been my clue. my bad.
Possibly, but not if it actually succedes

Probably because he is in a spiderman suit and is planning on doing something funny.
Where the hell do you live where you can't find pork rinds?

I thought it was gen 2 that was affected by the dead batteries due to the internal clock?
Love has no number
Xsara Picassos too
The only part of church I'm sad my kids will miss.
I wonder what would happen if you did the same thing to him.
[NAME] wants to know what you really mean.
Or maybe he's just super hot? Can't help it if you're a casanova.
Go to the movies with people not related to me.
He wants to be free to hit on other women. He may not take it any farther but that‚Äôs what it looks like to me.
Like this?

yes, i know that people think of me as some strange freak because i never talk to anyone and act so awkward in social situations
Don't meet your heroes
[NAME] lines especially. They're all so good because originally [NAME] was going to play that character.
Tell your husband. Its lies by omissions. Who are you to pick and choose what HE wants to know.
Why is it dumb? It's not like once people get married they believe in a society that looks down on premarital sex. Maybe you missed my point.
Y'all taking this way too seriously...the point is they're both fierce.
Is this strictly Denver, or for the metro area?
If [NAME] loses I‚Äôll break my phone, [NAME] is fighting like wilder what the fuck is this comeback

Unfortunate that her knee never rose to the occasion
That kid would be so young that he'd only have a chance to appear and fight in a sequel series.
In both points and fouls Edit: [NAME], looks like he didn't pick up that foul. Good news!
Found the apologist.
A man of culture i see
Equipment (PC & accessories), settings, the whole transition I feel lost to be honest
You make soap? That's awesome.
Same company probably makes bacon for Walmart and Kroger. Im guessing they're not the only ones
Kinda hot tho
There‚Äôs no way this gets signed, right? Is it just lip service?

Give me [NAME]. We need some thump when we clear the benches.
That unconvincing bottom right though hahaha
"""You got wrong daughter we don't owe you to 'repay' for grandchildren or so. Too bad."""
I think maybe it's because there are just more single moms. I don't know though so I'm going to look it up.
I wish it were. It would be funny to imply that [NAME] won [NAME] shirt!
I‚Äôm hugging you back!!! Not in a weird way. :-). Thank you, internet stranger. 
It's not funny, but what do you mean?
it was amazing
It‚Äôs actually not. But i agree.
Who the heck cant
Omg, there is a wallet made out of a dead squirrel on that sub! *SUBSCRIBED*
I don't think you can afford a lawyer. If fact, I would not be surprised to learn you don't actually have anything on QCX.
Agreed! I‚Äôm so excited for her story this season!

Good potatoes, good pasta.
Are you actually going to get on stage and say it into the mic? That‚Äôd be fuckin legendary
Because, ‚Äúnah you guys go ahead‚Äù

If you live in OC, you know who to blacklist : [NAME]

Fuck people that don't like pbr, only cheap bear I'll drink next to natty boh
Wasn't the scar originally across his nose but [NAME] moved it?
You do know that‚Äôs the direct quote from the movie, right?

He hasn't stopped clapping ever since
Thanks I will check that out.
I love the accidental deep frying from the tears on certain words

I'm looking at that scene like a tribute to TWAU2's demise
"Thanks, I'd never heard this information. Only ""humans have the best endurance"""

Feminists body-shaming and objectifying men

Oh, and there is also a picture of them kissing. Looks like someone else took it.
The entire thread makes me wish I WAS gay so that people won't pester me about having kids when I'm older
This was wild, laughed the entire post
Nifty hands trav, miles almost had that 
I feel the same on [NAME]. She's trying too hard to be hard-hitting etc. Thought she was poor on Thursday.
I would assume most people don't listen to the radio for more than an hour at a time.
I absolutely agree 100%.
It's like how I feel after I eat McDonalds. Satisfied, disappointed, sad, full, tired. 
Yeah, I just visited there and it seems more disordered than this sub... Strange

Politics in the KRG are some of the dumbest and most petty of the Middle East.
I‚Äôm finding lots of tribes here, thankfully. Between [NAME] and a narc mom & sister, I am extra screwed.
I think he has way more to fear from [NAME] than from U.S. people.
You guys will be shocked to know it is another cut of the Ga Spa vid.
You expect me to believe that [NAME] and [NAME] have so many things in common but are different people? Must be the same person.
Either you meant family doc or there's an interesting story here you're not sharing. I'm hoping for the latter.
I could never deface my car like that omg
"Little kids are the best because they're just like ""Wtf?!?!?"""""

[RELIGION] is indian tho lol
Thank you. Its only applicable if its not in the customer's favor and if they follow other stipulations.

What a sad story.
Havent been working for 10 years at this company about 5 now, but i have overall 10 years experience

Trespassing in Texas and you‚Äôll get shot. I would‚Äôve shot them.

Lol this is so true [NAME] thanks for sharing
[NAME], this is your MLA, right? Dude *does* seem like a plug. 
Prove me wrong then. Find another poll that supports your narrative. Until that point my source is what we have to go by.
I‚Äôm not going to get in to the boring details here, but... Too late.
It's funny how the mention snoop at the end of the article, reminded me of the chappelle's show episode about [NAME]
This makes me smile

Given that you're not a conservative and this isn't a debate sub, how about you just get the hell out and stay out.
exactly how i feel about it too. the guy is just a jerk, and can't be bothered to care unless it benefits him. selfish little prick
Now that you put it that way I can‚Äôt un-see it.
Thanks for sharing. Lies like this make it harder for the real ones to share and get justice
but what about my insecurities.
Just another above average looking girl who works out for a year and gets a million followers for posting her ass. We live in a society
I thought she had that same expression when he proposed as well. Or at some point during the proposal dinner

The original DayZ mod music was pretty intense.
Holiday getting abused as usual
Because they're rapists themselves or share rapist-like behaviors

Completely understandable. Lots of players who are new and don't realize how big of a distraction that is
For real tho let's dump our powerplay coach
This was pretty interesting. Creative, disturbing and very original. I honestly thought Hereditary was pretty bad, but I enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing.
I've heard of that. It did cross my mind
Him staying seems more realistic. I just hope we can land him.

Swordfish is my go to gun. Used my first unlock token it given how much I enjoyed it.
They're passionate about different things.
But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
I mean I love [NAME] as a player, but emotional attachment aside, we really need a consistent shooter 
Kill him the sinner
It was [NAME]. They were filming Django
Especially with the way they got rid of him... no real fanfare at all...
That‚Äôs awesome, wonder if it‚Äôs available to buy on eBay. 
Shocked we didn't take him back and plunk him in the minors.
Wow so you really are pro-abuse huh

There‚Äôs this which is terrifying to think about
The sad part is, they would do something like this. Totally obsessed with Green Bay instead of improving draft stock or the team.

I think [NAME] was just holding back, who'd want to go kill their nephew ([NAME] in [NAME]).
[NAME] didn't even know cass's e heals her until [NAME] told him :(
Ok who is yelling OHHHH every time [NAME] throws a punch

Wait did he actually do this? Seems like it would be insanely disrespectful to you fellow craftsmen.
Think the maid was colombian
The car analogy is silly because car problems are physical and material and hence clearly factual diagnosable. ‚ÄúToxic masculinity‚Äù is a squishy theoretical concept.
I would say that [NAME] is also acting a bit stubborn as he has pretty much shut down the government to get funding for the border wall.
The value of the knowledge from the books you could buy is priceless!
Day 2 Feels good, man!
someone who believes in facts.... thankz, this was also my understanding of how income generation works on youtube
Great, so we know the spanish pronounciation is therefore racist and now I'm offended by it.
I want the same drug OP is into thanks!
Tell him to breathe quietly during the show or else! Ha ha ha
You'd think he'd be under playing weight considering how 'light' his drink driving sentence was....
If you can't see how the mass killing of Landlords is related to Communist ideology, there is really no point discussing further.
love ya bro, i just love how positive you are!
Who the hell thinks he isn‚Äôt overpaid
"[NAME]: ""WTF, it's just a prank bro!"""
This. We already have so much more OL talent. We need another WR and TE, but I'm kinda excited
Do you have any hobbies? Potential hobbies that you're interested in?
> not broken I beg to differ.
I'm REALLY glad the guy saved him but seeing him so pitiful and scared really lingers with me. :(
My wife loves to sleep in over oversized clothes and a lot of times it ends up falling off one of her shoulders. Yes please.
I got a lot of withholding to throw me into anxiety.
All I ask is to not embarrass us on National TV like they did against Philly.
My DW made this realization. She is a smart one...and a keeper.
*Sweats in robot
I love this and him. What a good dude.
When you make excuses about what you're buying, you're the one calling attention to it.
OMG make it I want to be in on the ground floor of something #INVEST INVEST
*my sister and my mommy. they just edamame*
Thanks for your words. I appreciate hearing from you. You bring up some very disturbing points.
Now that's brilliant... 30? woah. I'm only 19, hope it doesn't take me that long 
Yes, this at least makes sense. 
I also love Dallas Observer's Concert Calendar by day:
I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I‚Äôll hate them like the rest. 
AND HIS OPPONENT WRESTLING OUT OF MANHATTAN, NEW YORK WEIGHING IN AT 185 POUNDS: ‚ÄúSTORMIN‚Äô ‚Äú NORMAN OSBORN!
[NAME]. Im sorry
The most cringeworthy thing about this is that they have missed a golden opportunity to say pizza time.
Ah the good old Russian Right Hook.
Unfortunately for me you have to be 23 or older to drive for TMC
Great list!
PLEASE PLACE YOUR ITEM IN THE BAG. PLEASE PLACE YOUR ITEM IN THE BAG. AN ATTENDANT HAS BEEN NOTIFIED TO ASSIST YOU.
You're not wrong, [NAME], you're just an asshole.
Is there any way to somebody can please translate the notes into doc form or something? I am having trouble viewing them :(
How much less could you care?
R1/L1, always played like this R2/L2 feels weird and slow
Yes! Dont you love to let babies suck you with a perfect jawline!
It's realistically his last chance to get a big payday.
Been a while since I watched but you gotta go through the mirror and put the bear under the bed. Then you can go with her.
All the best. Safe travels.
Had the item hit you, I would have asked security to hold them, for you to press charges for assault. No one should be entertaining that foolishness
I completely agree with you just the whole mood against abortion gets my blood boiling.
Fuck. That.
I guess they thought the crit boost was way better than it is?
I agree with everything you said!
But then they can't draw the m word
I think [NAME] is starting to get too much blame, everybody on the roster sucks with the exception of [NAME] 
that's not split pushing. split pushing is literally pushing 2 lanes at once.
You are awesome, i envy you
Man that's making me reconsider not buying his jersey...
ultimately, you want a pitcher that is better than average at pitching.
It could be how depression is effecting you but i don't think it's crazy
Hey man, as a [NAME] living part time in South Africa, I really appreciate you making a beautiful version of our flag :)
Thanks, now I can get back to the actual content
I may have got lung cancer and hiv but at least I was around when [NAME] was haha baby-boomer win!
[NAME] - OT3 in my team without me... [NAME] - Sometimes bad things just happen...
Plus, thinking you know someone that you don't just weirds them out. It must be disturbing having people flock around your persona, ffs.
TIL that TYL that this is both of their jokes. Even if it was like that is funny.
I remember being three years old and feeling mortified and frustrated that my preschool teacher and classmates were freely dancing to ridiculous music.
Or you could learn to reverse park and stop whining. It‚Äôs a lot easier to park backwards.
Why do you guys care so much?
Psst, your spoiler tag is busted. Don't leave spaces between the ! and your text.
I mean, a lot of animals I've seen get terrified of regular stuffed animals, imagine having your fears super sized like that
This is way too oblivious to not be satire
Don't tell me what to do. I'm not going to argue with someone who goes around calling everything bro science.
OH YEAH ITS FINE
If Clemson wins this, they should have to face Alabama in the national championship.
It's hard to try to evaluate yourself, but I appreciate you trying.
I'd be ok with this former Israeli IDF general.
You'd think we don't have anymore tears already... It's been 62 years of crying.
Then who is it? I've mixed results with all fighters, but I definitely lose to [NAME] the most.
Yeah, I‚Äôm curious how these notes are ‚Äúpassive‚Äù. 
I'm sorry for you... That sounds not cool :'(
I‚Äôve never been punched by a kangaroo, so we‚Äôre even.
I mean, you can't be any more in the friends zone if you have a matching neck tattoo with the chick.
My holy trinity of [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] all win!
Just gotta day that age gap might have something to do with this. I bet he hates that dang rap music too.
a butt ....hahahahahahaha ......every 4th grader ever
Great start to the post-All-Star game part of the campaign!
It‚Äôs amazing how buggy this game is. Itd [NAME] buying a new car with most of the parts broken. We will fix it eventually.
i actually like adore (maybe I‚Äôm uneducated oof) what has she done?
He should be banned from the nfl. I can‚Äôt get behind this.
Lol! Exactly. ‚òπ
Thank you. Let‚Äôs not blame one parent only for the existence of a child, or the batshitness of one coparent. 
*dramatic anime gasp* impossible!
Oh would you look at this....
I am ashamed of your sequel memes. Prequel memes or no memes
Oh no this is cute
Thanks for actually reading and responding to the question...;) I‚Äôll check those out
He probably got hurt making the video
Savannahs? Like 30 lb dogs in a cat skin and they look amazing to boot.
Dang this is awesome
I have basically that print on a t-shirt, it's definitely coming out of the closet more often as soon as the campaign is official.
I don't think [NAME] gets enough hate for pushing that.
Those ears...those horrible ears
The comment thread is a hot mess and wouldnt be out of place in 2016. How do things not change....
When [NAME] pisses off his daughter and wife. Daughter: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my Daddy anymore‚Äù [NAME]: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my Daddy anymore either‚Äù
I would make that face too if I just realized I was HC of the New York Jets
I agree!!! His character has grown so much throughout the entire series and I was very disappointed that he ended up with her.
two robocoughs what a good idea i love buying robocough by the case
Remember: lie, cheat, steal and listen to heavy metal music!
[NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
Plus FIFA can get corrupt officials in 3 countries to compete to see who can line their pockets better!
Unless wages for food service workers change you better keep tipping.
We‚Äôve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn‚Äôt rise to the level we warned him about.
This post is not going to age well.
I buy VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. I have a huge collection.
Watch the [NAME] fanbois raging on the thread.
And then the rest of that thread devolves into [NAME] supporters arguing against and downvoting anyone who disagrees with the wall or hates [NAME].
I'm curious, because this reminds me of where I used to go to school: What town is it?
My point is, theres millions of men who aren't [NAME] tech employees who could theoretically be speaking out with no real consequences 
I look amazing
oh is that it
I like, don't like it!
>i told him we weren't sick we were just on drugs. Lol unexpected
Ughh same. Love the finish of it just wish it had more coverage.
[NAME] man, once again [NAME] proves why is he the L.O.A.T, luckiest of all time
i heard that the flames from the fire were so hot, they literally burned the very wood the church was made of
Market ‚â† Capitalism Just because something operates within the Capitalist system doesn't make it Capitalist. Just because [NAME] was (supposedly) elected didn't make him democratic
Wow, I know he is the voice of [NAME], but I did not know he basically IS [NAME]
This was beautiful!
I was almost certain it was gonna be [NAME]
He‚Äôs not under contract.
I ALWAYS notice how [NAME] used latex gloves now
on the rim
im alright my dude, didn‚Äôt realize how dark this was i might take it down
Put down that you are a starting forward and love incinerating $100 bills. Stay strong my Asia brah
My rabbit had one just like this before she passed. I hope the animal is okay.
Coming from [NAME] even though it‚Äôs a hypothetical question it‚Äôs still gotta feel scary
I like the six nations partly because I get to hear a packed out Murrayfield sing flower of Scotland and that‚Äôs always brilliant
It positively reeks of an abusive household
It didn't take me any longer than the first, and I feel uncomfortable now
omg so quirky
Yep completely bc no kids ever liked to draw. Definitely me.
Who created, carried and raised all these men? A woman .
I broke contact after 6 months. It happens to the best of us. Get back on the proverbial horse.
It's legal now in quite a few states. People get booze for Christmas all the time. I'd be stoked.
I earned the money, I bought the food and I cooked the food so don't go thanking your phoney baloney god for it in my home.
Bjj= Brazilian jujitsu, they are known to have stupid think necks due to constantly being grabbed around the neck while grappling.
I always tried to go first if possible tbh. You're not gonna get away, might as get it over with quickly.
Other dude is right, OP and [NAME] comment got me masturbating
That's just reckless. He's lucky he didn't get permanently disfigured or killed.
Do it!
I would be surprised if she's doesn't have at least 1 kid
Plot twist, she's accepted [NAME] as her Lord and Savior.
Thank you and CONGRATS MAN!! I listen to podcasts too when I get ready! Greatly helps with the negative thoughts. Glad we did it!!
Beautiful. I really hope some justice is brought to these people.
What a beautiful sight that was to behold. Glad I was able to attend a couple of great [NAME] performances. ‚ÄúK‚Äù signs everyone
We can only hope that they will appreciate our sacrifices once they get older!
"Because they claim to be against [NAME], and they need something called ""votes"" to beat him?"
It's like an instinct for idiots to downvote without even reading a comment first if they sense the word vegan in it haha
This has to be the 7th time this was posted
Most of his overtly sexual posts give me that vibe...they seem exploitative and as just another way to prove he owns her
Weird flex but ok
This is literally the *only* thing I know about warhammer orks and I feel kind of bad about that. It's the coolest concept: faith-based technology.
Thankkks and np
That's a low bar, I haven't met a single one that had anything more than second hand knowledge of the tenancy act.
I like this response. I can‚Äôt give you gold but have some honorary gold.
Good Luck at the SuperBowl [NAME]!
Just don‚Äôt bother. Let them have their hateful circle jerk. When they lock eyes while coming, that‚Äôs their favorite.
I TOO AM HUMAN AND I SENSE A JOKE HA YES I AGREE WITH YOIR LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION.
An interesting video, though the title's lack of an Oxford comma is bothering me.
Yeah ik that should be unacceptable too lmao
Yes I love that show! I need to watch the last episodes now that I think of it
Tfw when not only is it tiny, but it‚Äôs damn ugly too. :( 
Hoping Heavy Machinery get the win. Would like to see them as champs.
Unfortunately there are also far less/weaker unions now too
Why does everyone insist on trying to do this? Just open the [NAME] damn bottle with your thumb like a decent human being.
oh stop IT
Honestly many of these games that they lost they didn‚Äôt even play poorly, to me they looked pretty good and just unfortunately lost the game 
Let's go [NAME]
Comic sans to seal the deal. Love it.
That sucks. But you can find another SO. You can't unhave a kid.
ift yourself up on your feet! Let's get it on!
It's ok, it's been posted a lot lately 
People like that will have children because if that's all somebody cares about only a matter of time before contraception is not used and well there ya go.
> 2. Give me any evidence that women don't want to date me.
And it should be drenched in blood. It‚Äôs supposed to be scary, that‚Äôs how you know [NAME] loves you!
This! is! Killing!
Maybe the abandonment of his mother. Some people won‚Äôt see that as abusive but it really is.
Yeah cuz they don't exist lol
Sounds like you had a much rougher night than me. You win this round
It‚Äôs my favorite part of the whole week
Healthier and more disgusting.
Ah that's so cool!!
how about now
I think bluey is quite possibly the greatest kids s how I've ever seen So quintessentially Aussie, nails family life, funny as hell. Love it
Sad/Sweet for her to put in the effort to fake it!
I'm really enjoying Season 3 but this would ruin it for me.
I second this. 3 months is early to really know someone anyway. She could want kids for all the wrong reasons and you wouldn't even know.
Been there a few times but not recently. I'm a builder mostly, been behind the scenes and behind a fair amount of big brands since 2008-ish
What are you smoking?
You‚Äôre so close:) hope you can get one
The Japanese and the British can do it well, but they probably get like 10x the funding per capita.
As a [NAME] this makes me proud.
The various meta-reddit subreddits really do seem to have very distorted ideas about what Reddits actually like.
I have no objection to nudity, but why is this a thing? So dumb. 
Oh, it‚Äôs actually its own thing. I heard goo and just assumed the worst.
Oh yeah, I forgot what they are called lol, Thank you
Genetics is Everything
Well I hope so, I work in a pawnshop in a not great part of town and I'd love to be able to carry
Nope, but I'm sure it was mostly sales, you can lose a lot of clients if they lose the salesperson they have a relationship with.
lol [NAME]
I hope for Irelands sake you're right.
Give me liberty or give me death metal
What a cool argument dude!! Lol. This coming from the worlds most empowered dater who can date anyone!! Stop age shaming.
They‚Äôre looking at her like they wish they‚Äôd ordered her instead.
everyone does it.
Mmmm...just won it back too. But wasn't given the fief...
I‚Äôm not going to live in the middle of nowhere. I like Chicago.
I have yet to see a single reasonable person supporting [NAME]. Not on Reddit, not on Twitter, nowhere. 
I just need [NAME] to retire already so I can stop hating on him and appreciate all he's done... Even if it has caused me great suffering.
There's having fun and being a hoe, OP seem to assume what she is, so ni worries for her. 
He's gotta be a robot or a test tube baby. Only explanation.
"Same, I always disliked his ""thuggish"" personality and popoffs on stream but he seems like a genuinely nice guy."
There's a correlation between how corrupt a country is and how corrupt it is perceived. edit: DOI:10.1023/A:1013882225402, If you can't acces, scihub still exist.
I'm sorry but did anybody else read the first paragraph and get flashbacks to My Immortal? \x45\x62ony [NAME], is that you???
Luckily every elevator would be broken at all times.
Too greasy.
I had the same thought also.
Good thing the booze wasn‚Äôt in the cart yet... bottles to the face!
She probably just said it because it rhymes, sorry Op
You can buy bitesize toad in the holes in Tesco. They are amazing. These look like they use hotdogs but I imagine would be almost as good.
Not at all,I've got friends I never did anything with
He‚Äôd probably be on best behavior... for a while.
This screwball is an anti-semite [NAME] supporter, no point in engaging it. 
But should I? And who would I report that too? since none of us 3 are in the same country
Oh we're doing this again huh
Doing a happy dance! Yay!
Yeah thanks.
You read the body, right?
I cackled at [NAME] face down in the corner.
You need to change your locks.
Next up: Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head
Your imaginary boyfriend is kinda creepy. Although, if he's kinky then he may be for keeps. *wink 
[NAME] killed him and was only in for like 5 minutes...
Thanks for the explanation. I got out pre marriage and always wonderd if it would have got worse if we had got married
It‚Äôs a circlejerk that‚Äôs so strong it could power a small country
Just Deep Fry This and post it on r/dankmemes
‚ÄúI thought I was suppose to love 2018 wtf‚Äù
This is the most pleasant debate I‚Äôve ever had on reddit. Also, $nah$
[NAME], now i‚Äôm graduated trying to pay off my student loans
So fucking heart warming. Brother love man it‚Äôs wholesome as shit.
HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY‚ÄΩ AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES‚ÄΩ MARK IT ZERO!
Geez. Why is Duchene their 3C?
Maybe I‚Äôm unsure of that
as is tradition, guy who played for us scores against us to make us lose, third time in three months
This guy journalists.
oh fuck i've never been more sure we're gonna lose
That is so sad, just goes to show we have a lot more to learn about the other beings we share this rock with : /
Humiliation on top of arrest!!!
Something like that lol
Love this guy, love this team
Thank you friend
Good because I've been waiting since September!
Missed
Cool. I'll have to keep that banter in mind for the next time it happens. Thank you for the response, I really appreciate it
Time to go to heaven, son.
Fox News is generally not what I would call credible. Any other links?
Emergency vehicle, lights on, no siren?
Oh [NAME]...
I only remember one lady, interesting. Just watched it a year ago lol.
The new live-action movie looks great!
I think [NAME] is the best QB Prospect since [NAME] and I would kill for my Lions to get him.
you know what song goes well with this? 880 by [NAME]
Yes, good for Destiny and Bungie, I wonder if they will return to Microsoft, remain independent or sign with another company.
Yeah he's a cunt but that doesn't mean he should be prosecuted for a joke. No matter how bad taste it was.
Love [NAME], but he is really dumb when it comes to politics and economics.
Thank you & my heartfelt condolences. Snap in to a watermelon and drink to forget.
Again, that + is going to make people not want to do this deal.
Guice was a fuckin monster.
Um congratulations on being a housewife .. Lol?
Try queueing up to play against humans. And then make your decision based on the queue times.
>Yes, I know that you like to talk about yourself a lot :P I do use a lot of words. It's actually embarrassing. 
Like taking a life from someone without their consent at all? Just because they cant speak doesnt mean they're giving you the right to kill them.
HAHAHA YES MEYERS
No, this is [NAME]
Wait, what? You're a gamer who's never even heard of TB?
Being misunderstood really is the worst thing ever! I‚Äôm sorry some people are so unkind.
Literally awesome that someone else is doing the same thing! Funny thing is I go for two a year also. Heck yeah fellow dodger friend
No way dude... Always make sure the dude with the camo hat is standing right behind you
WHAT THE FUCK
I had my skin half ripped off thanks to a belt machine. Never got my arm close to the belts
"""My body is not me, but it is only one of the most popular songs ever."
If you google translate it means ‚Äúnugget‚Äù which I find hilarious.
Watch alpha jackals explanation of the Nerf. It's a great explanation
Yes. (That's the back side of the Palace hotel.)
And by the way that it is
DON'T DO THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES LIKE THAT THEY DON'T WANT HER EITHER BRUH
"""Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of them are stupider than that."" - [NAME]"
I don't know why but every time I see a meme telling me how good I am it doesn't do anything and doesn't make me happy
Welcome. We eat our own.
Well then I‚Äôd say you have a pretty good chance if it‚Äôs any girl lol
This has to be my favorite part of this article. WHAT DOES HE MEAN!?!?!
By having to pay out over a hundred million in lawsuits?
damn. Thanks!
UPDATE i got a set of spare keys finally and rescued my dogs. theyre happy happy and being spoiled with treats. I APPRECIATE YOU ALL
Grow up.
You are correct. I was mistaken. My apologies. I appreciate the correction.
Is this really a bad thing? Even if you don't wanna lose your virginity yet, just cuddling is great.
Pedophilia is a gender, shitlord
Lol. Go astroturf r/politics. We aint buying her leftist bs here
[NAME] and the Chicago Wolves (I'm so sorry)
Fun fact: [NAME] decided to delete an entire string of comments after mine because they made him look like more of a man-child than he already is ;)
I'm really concerned for those 3200'ish people who voted yes
And I‚Äôll be there!!!
No one in their right mind would pick Mount over Aouar lol People love to overrate our academy players sometimes
Ha at least you‚Äôre in on the joke.
So this is what edging feels like
It‚Äôs best we end this conversation before someone interprets that differently
My school usually says that you should avoid fighting and try leaving the premisis asap
I actually heard [NAME] inviting [NAME] and [NAME] to be on her show, after the interview with [NAME] ex wife.
Thanks lol someone else just filled me in on the backstory haha üòÇ
Lmao That‚Äôs a blatant lie, ~1000 people were killed by American cops last year compared to 52 cops killed by civilians 
*shooting stars plays*
good cause i don‚Äôt want it!! haha.
are you fcking serious sis
"Hopefully ""new games"" doesn't mean ""new ways to put money into other things besides our main games."""
Keep on going
That was a great episode
Can‚Äôt buy a bucket...just one of those games
I mean, it is, slowly but surely. It sucks. 
The USA welfare spend is quite low per gdp compared to first world countries. The safety nets are ridiculous or nonexistant and the inequality is ridiculous...
Agreed. And I like how far you can see into the distance
Wow, you must have no idea what medium of exchange means.
Hahaha where was this when I started out.
first alien is hotter tbh
I told their kid that it was okay to be upset. (He was anxious and I was validating his feelings.)
A whale would probably choke to death if it tried to swallow you.
This makes me so happy, having a step parent can be a sensitive thing but you are definitely a good example of what to do, congrats!
Not an effective solution. Shooter always has first move, taking out an unsuspecting teacher would give a shooter access to better arms.
Uh, yeah. That was a dumb question and if you thought it was going somewhere you re dead wrong.
[NAME] faults during his playing days shouldn‚Äôt define his coaching ability.
Vote every one of them out that was quoted as being upset about the wire and not the corruption.
Yeah well you‚Äôre a horrible [NAME]
A lot of software guys are. Source: in software
Wow .. this is more terrifying than if they were a ghost ! Amazing twist
Saving for later
You Libs. alhave you heads so far up you arses it isn't even funny.
I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
> It's about equality of outcomes. It's beyond that.
I‚Äôm from Oklahoma City. Not a small city, but a few of his patients are from there.
Create a youtube channel for when you work on cars.
I'm not being told I have issues by a guy who actually and genuinely has an interest in coprophagia.
I'm fairly new to this group and just realized my nightmares started the day I joined. However, I still somehow love it!
Isnt this a sociopathic tendency? A total disregard to your danger
Here we go. What‚Äôs wrong with them.
I got a [NAME] vibe earlier, but I see this
You just told a bunch of random people, I think you‚Äôll have no problem telling her
I really can't imagine someone saying that if the gender was reversed.
The new persona is only if you get the true ending. Not sure if the thread poster has but just in case he didn‚Äôt
Support the Sydney ~~Blues~~ Sixers. Loved that gaff last night.
Yea but did u see [NAME] pass to [NAME] miss
Oh no... It's never had sex before.
NEVER SEEN BEFORE! READ ALL ABOUT IT!
"""No known gold medals"""
Just curious: What do you normally do with your weekends?
I came here just to bask in this thread. Yesterday was wonderful....it was just wonderful.
Hey everyone I like my braves subbreddit without advertisements
Sweeter than ever.
Then he is innocent. I'd rather have a president that we know for sure isnt undermining our democracy by conspiring with a foreign nation.
Ok, I have to see this thing now.
I was surprised too
Furry and scaly damn
Did you really just link a study about partner violence and then equate that to the entirety of violence? Holy shrimp.
I remember being 4 and so excited to help pair the socks after they were dried. Kids love being involved.
Sorry. I am avoiding arguments today. Enjoy the video.
Lost my only grandfather two years ago to Alzheimer's, this is great news knowingly this disease sucks
This is great editing! I know this took a lot of work/time. Awesome job!
My dad wears that sweater every game day! It‚Äôs in much worse condition however
I don't remember this song at all I had it on psp back then.
only suckers believe this don't be a sucker
...and that's the second time I got crabs.
Now it's cheering for the two to come back
Please try again; even [NAME] would make for a better ending.
Do you find yourself depressed a lot? I feel like depression comes out of boredom.
This girl looks STRONG!! I want her to be my goddess and I will please her on command!
Btc is a shite coin
and it's way better than the shit websites do now.
Don‚Äôt worry, [NAME] already added it to his collection.
The title says be your own hero, which is the title of the article medium article linked. 
He seems to think that will take too long. I guess he‚Äôd rather complain to me.
Lol i thought the ratio was 35% or 1/3 of [NAME]. I think u got it wrong But yeh gtfo of bum fuk nowhere
No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.
I think it says lanef instead of loner
Fantastic. Would love to see where its at at 250 and 500 hours - I'm sure still well ahead of my 1/3 hourly.
A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
No just hung up
Very true.
It's better to say a moment like that could truly ignite her love for the game rather than putting a bit of a damper on it.
Especially weird considering [NAME] went to Fresno State and [NAME] went to Long Beach State.
Well, glad I could help. Have a fantastic day and don‚Äôt let the straights scare you away!
Pretty sure she bleached her eyebrows on purpose
[NAME] as a Giants fan and [NAME] as a [NAME], I think I need this 
I remember a few others have posted this happening to them in the past.
I don't think you're allowed to administer a vaccine to someone who is sick/injured.
so obnoxious.
Don‚Äôt be clinically depressed, go outside! Be happy! üòä
Also a lot of houses in the US might not have too many neighbours. It‚Äôs a lot more sparse out there
Okay then. Please remind me again why the lack of support is death threats in my PMs.
It's certainly not one I identify with, but I find it intriguing. Hence my starting this discussion. 
Reddit GM over here. Someone hire this genius.
Man, fuck that shit. He lost us the Sonics, he has no business running for public office.
I used to hate them too, but since vikendi I‚Äôve gotten pretty used to them 
At least he'll always have a job in a russian circus. Cant teach a bear to do that trick
I want this cat
If the wealthy behave as if its fine to discount the future then its fine for the poor to take from them.
True as it can be
~~Comrade~~ [NAME] I'm appalled that you would accuse me of using performance enhancing drugs. Neigh! Neigh I say!
I pray this changes.
Sloppy ball handling and feels like there‚Äôs a lid on the bucket. Just not our day
So are leftists ones. You will get banned for disagreeing with someone REEEEing at trump.
The local council is gonna have fun removing all those dodgy fillings.
I mean I'm genuinely not sure if I'd rather be tortured for all eternity or have to spend all eternity in Sunday services
aww hell no. This fucking ad
"Submissive? ""she‚Äôs a [NAME] so literally it‚Äôs like a brand new car [NAME] has blessed me with."" You're disgusting."
Every other way sounds wrong. SPR for life.
To be fair, I will also continue to jerk off to pictures of [NAME] in shorts He looks so good in them
Standing ovation. Nicely done.
Thanks for the feedback. Sorry, and welcome.
Cute! Love it sister
OH MY [NAME]
Seriously?
This is the cutest! Wearing your heart on your sleeve so to speak.
[NAME], I hate [NAME].
Kind of uncool dude
Did people really go against [NAME] when he came out? I wasn't as in to his stuff at the time but I remember people being supportive.
[NAME] sure saved that one from swirling down the toilet. Thank you [NAME].
Ahh you poop too much
Why are they asking women and nonwhites specifically?
Because he's looking at the love of his life! Oh does he love the person looking at him in that big screen!
There has to be someone that loves you, you just may not see it right now. 
The best timeline
Just curious, would it be logged on the system if they were accessed?
"[NAME] funded ""The Life Of Brian"" as well"
Fackin foreigners trying to steal ar players! #WeAreAllTommyWright
Hitting your kids for punishment just makes them sneakier. Maybe that has something to do with the dishonesty of the church and [RELIGION] in general.
It really didn't. You were the one who came out hurling insults around. Are you projecting? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Yep, I guess this is a no-go for me. Thanks!
I read that as vape-inspired. Little puffs of smoke rolling down the road...
If I start shoving food into my face as I enjoy everyone here, dis becomes a bery bery unhealthly situation. 
Omg is this that what older kids call s*x?1?1??1??
Not really sure we could get salary's to match up
A hug? Lol, shugos new hugs look alot more fluid and faster. Get ready to eat more
I feel like I've seen a comment like this on another post
Hold off a bit, Dallas is in a big time housing bubble, wait for it to pop, then strike 
"he can still be heard uttering ""I'm a huge fan"" alone in a dark room"
From [NAME]: I T ' S S P E L L E D O U I J A Goodbye
Nay ye can't stop them. Have to let it play out and hope they don't throw a few curse words in there.
[NAME], but I‚Äôm not sure he is gonna be a piston for a long time.
On this blessed day, we are all KQLY.
I love the fsct [NAME] liked this. [NAME] can suck it.
Oh I thought the laugh was from that one mech show
We sign [NAME] we are oing to the playoffs(barring injury) don't sign him, and that's a question mark(even without any injuries) 
The fake news media and it's supporters are the enemy of the people.
According to?
I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
biological gender isn't real. it's biological sex. do some research
Alright imma set small goals for myself thanks for tip man!
because [NAME] is already signed in on their device and you dont remember their password and really want to see what happens next season
This happened to me 6 months ago and I am still hurt and actively trying to talk to her... Idk how to stop
Socialism?!?! But le higher taxes!!
Every game counts for the Kings tho. Suns are out if the playoff race and this is a must win for the Kings. BOL!
Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna 
I wish I was [NAME]. Source (deleted):

it really sucks how absolutely fucked some of us got genetically in the chest department
The details on this building are fantastic. If anyone gets a chance to see it up close, you definitely should.
"RBI? ""Reddit bungles it""? "
too much internet
And he doesn‚Äôt even stop. It‚Äôs your work truck, man! They‚Äôre going to find out regardless. 
Thank you, next! 
like I said, it's painful.
Congratulations on securing your CF Future!!!
That ET one looks like he has stuck his finger is some strawberry jello or something and is disgusted that some has stuck to his finger!
[NAME] was the [NAME] of the [NAME] years. Didn't realise he was still about.
That fact that sub has so many subscribers hahahahaha
What are the issues you have been having?
this is one of the few quality ones posted
[NAME] is nowhere close to the worst linebacker in the league.
I didn't realise there was only one car on the road?
Yeah I love my friends and my own cats on drugs. They're the perfect buddies. I love being with them when I'm tripping.
"That's not correct. The ""Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK Combined Statistical Area"" includes Durant, as it does Athens. "
I‚Äôm sorry to be that guy, but I don‚Äôt get it 
Hopefully the Chouteau Greenway ends up narrowing Market street back to its original width.
You would LOVE this big mutt. He's a doll.
Lol ik it's just I wanted people to figure it out and not the bot to ruin it.
If you think not actively going out your way to insult people constitutes hiding your sexuality I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
Try painting a penis around the pothole. Seems to have worked in Manchester
Haha I should probably clarify it was family owned and managed
Been to 54 countries at age 34. No debts, ever. Aiming for retirement in my early 40's. Life is good.
That's interesting
Yah he is right, just find it hypocritical.
Maybe [NAME] Paganism given the Viking Age, Did I already address Hellenism?
Thats great... Here same with me
I love the thumbnail dude, but I‚Äôm already Soldier
What's really sad is that [NAME] wants to outlaw gay dads. I'm literally shaking.
Absolutely is, sorry. I just came by to say Howdy back until I saw all the hubbah. [NAME]. 
He's most likely been misinformed
Did you know that [NAME] got shot in the head while shooting AND HE KEPT ACTING
I‚Äôm not crying.. You‚Äôre crying!
I like them all as long as they are not fake.
Finally, I can sit on another person‚Äôs lap and have them not be disgusted
Yeah, he's 8-1 in his last 9 games played. Pretty great if you ask me.
happy cake day!
[NAME] was high sticked 3 times, cut twice before a call
Lets make a new reddit. Everything here is a repost anyways. r/conspiracy is the most fun though. Lets start from scratch.
Yeah nuance is in desperate need. The world is complex. Simple answers using simple binary thinking may not give us meaningful political discourse.
just asking a question... like I said I haven't been watching other teams much this year so Idk what players values are like right now...
Lovely places to buy from but very hard to get a good price as a seller because of their high rents (and bargaining expertise!)
i just giggled like a girl.
Thanks for contributing to the point I just made. More complaining and self-assuring. Yap away.
You are a shining ray of light in a dark chessless world. thank you my friend.
I really hope we see another fighter like him he was so fun to watch, a fighting machine with that killer instinct
I find Asian men hot and have dated a few - I'm a white woman
Right?! That‚Äôs up there with falling and hitting your eye on a doorknob.
Find yourself another pretty, nice girl that doesn‚Äôt have cheating tendencies. They exist

Oh wow okay, where can I get a wind proof lining beaning or scarf? And do I have to cover my eyes or anything?
Everyone is a little toxic inside. I feel like killers being toxic comes from survivors being toxic and vice versa. It's a vicious cycle.
Reminds me of that last scene in Coraline, where she's walking through the woods. Cool photo.
I like Sao very much, bit not because of the game setting, for other reasons. The game itself sucks, tbh.
My greatest fears are getting wooshed and not getting the joke.
Yeah but you're not anymore I'm afraid.
I don‚Äôt like [NAME] very much either, but she‚Äôs not a mess here. 
Parliamentary systems don't have the same separation of powers anyway. But it's the executive of Bavaria, not the federal executive telling them how to vote.
Who's [NAME]?
ALL HAIL THE RAT KING!
Working now, 5:00PM EST.
I am so upset for you and your family. She knew what she was doing, which makes this even more horrifying.
Gotta love an environmentally friendly coaching staff.
Am love u

aw momma big hugs.
You must be heartbroken, I‚Äôm so sorry. Can you start seeing a therapist?
Besides, you have no clue which ones I have and haven't done. 
So uncharacteristic for an INTJ but country music is my favorite genre!
And then everyone clapped
Interesting indeed üòï
Your parents must have adopted.
I know right? Getting that wrong would‚Äôve de-railed the joke.
I'm sure the cleaning bill he caused isn't even remotely offset by the flights he's purchased.
I mean I‚Äôm playing a card game and enjoying the cheap cards
"""So... I'm gonna go back to my class and sit in my seat like you told me to, if you don't mind..."""
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
I'm not super happy about having to see his face in the news for at least another 6 years.
That's the same thing 8 year olds use to try and get my items in video games. The guilt and shame strategy... Pathetic.
That‚Äôs a sweet hoodie
Not relevant. Evangelicals frequently preferring [NAME] to the likely alternatives has nothing to do with the alt-right; there's a little overlap but not much.
You got whooshed fair and square. Take your medicine.
There was a horrible accident

I'm currently playing a child character and noone at the table has a problem with my 91 year old elf.
Kids are playing fortnite. I have a few hundred hours played of the latest COD on PC and have encountered maybe one kid on comms.
I didnt even recognize [NAME]!!!
Still new to me
Problem is as soon as someone criticises Israel they jump up and down and scream anti semitism
She raided [NAME] closet.
All armed robbers, serial killers, rapists, swindlers all downplay the severity of their actions... 
[NAME] instead of [NAME] for me, but glad to see [NAME] is doing well.
oh shoot, im sorry to hear that. was it someone close to you? 
America v Necaxa Was postponed till March. America doesn't play until next Jornada 2
Yeah he is crazy early game, but as soon as you get a few items on an ap character, you just kill him before he combos lol
Wow it looks like we held our own negotiating here, nice to see.
Why is this getting downvoted?
So you ignored the part I was clearly responding to, though, and decided you needed to explain the other thing. That makes sense to you?
[NAME] has a second channel called JessiStyles! She has dry skin :)
Taxation is not an aspect of socialism
Never would‚Äôve guessed that one.
has anyone been successful sending bitcoin to another wallet?
Mommy bad man!!!
Get himmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!
lol, Cause everyone knows that you lean on the Bow. What bow skin is that?
It is not so much the organs but rather the fluids within the organs that reek when burned. N8
I really don't think healthy people with no other emotional issues regret having their kids.
Is [NAME] gonna die to a bucket of water at the end of the series?
He would probably just treat the situation like A$AP Bari‚Äôs.
And spending extravagant amounts on campaigning to impress the poor fools with the money that could have been used to improve their lives.
So, I'm wondering if there's something I can use for this project that will help you if it's solid.
The sad part about this is that these memes are more Gen Z if anything...
High five to that shit. We have 2 littles.....we are also exhausted lol
Why is this still not banned

No I think he just meant that losing half of your shit should at least move the needle a little lol
Let's wrap him in bubble wrap to be safe

Why would you mention [NAME]? Lol
Press fucken charges the moment they use your info.
Reading a screenshot of comments from Facebook on Reddit
They should all be virgins until they're old enough to consent. Obviously this applies to both genders just like drinking laws.

Beautiful, nice work

Careful, you are almost criticizing your god in chief. Your friends at TD will probably ban you for that.
The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.
I'm 14 stone...so probably about 2 stone over weight. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs, but I love food.... 
don't you get it? It's freedom to kill children now...
I wanted [NAME] so bad, but at least we got a cute character (little ticked about the scythe but, I'll still play her)
Oh ok, so we're agreeing. I didn't see that last part where you put him at 22. My bad. :-)
This question was on here like 2 days ago with 95/5
What the Fuck?
[NAME] loves playing in Toronto
I wouldn't have thought if you hadn't mentioned Harry Potter. I appreciate the reminder. Teamwork!

Fruit is byfar the worst of all flavors
I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
[NAME] looks great
My fault, I jumped to a conclusion. I forgot that savanna cats are spotted not leopard print.
When people who know nothing about MLK besides their middle school education talk about MLK
"What are you talking about? This sub defended ""it's just camo ,it's realistic"". [NAME] including myself all begged for better visibility lmao "
It wouldn't surprise me if they were paid crisis actors
Suddenly, Dorion will fleece another GM of their 1st pick for [NAME] ? Not a chance.
> pro peace. Somehow pro-peace became pro-Putin. Yes, people have lost their minds.
was the same with me for a couple of years before puberty.. i was frequently mistaken for an adult woman..
Right!? I'm glad someone else noticed. I was horrified when she trespassed into a stranger's home. So violating!
cutest vid I've seen in a while
I wish I had your efficiency. I can be at work a full shift and still get almost nothing done.
You did a good choice :) i hope all goes well im proud of you !!!!! :)

Kinda weird to continuously shoot at Police too...
Yep, same here. Got way too excited, then logical part of my brain kicked in. 
Does anybody know who has the contract to build it?
Women, in the modern world, know how to fight these weasels. We need many more women in positions of power.

After someone told me about goat yoga I now believe all anecdotes like this.
I believe it was clear I disagreed. And I don‚Äôt play wow.
Yeah, everyone goes through this phase during their Junior year of high school. 
It would be nice if he was at least a spirit. They have plenty more obscure anime characters as spirits already you know?

Oh, [NAME] 
Oh fuck off. Soooo...... when is [NAME] and the gang going to un mask [NAME] as President [NAME]?
No negotiations with terrorists.
I fail to see how: capitalists are the ones responsible for going to war and not the government, how wars make money.
we will see I hope your right. all we can do is play our best.
I‚Äôm glad at least one good thing could come from my experience!
Hell yes üòÅ I loved it.
Welcome to the Just Cause experience
Doctors hate him! *Like* if you love **[NAME]**, *Ignore* if you worship the **[NAME]!**

You have the bear mask?? :D it is glorious!
Man that was like 6 minutes ago
Glad I could help. Feels good once in a while, I know the feeling.
i would agree with that. i still dont see a good reason not to provide daycare though.
No, you said you think she deserves whatever she can afford. Can she afford housing?
That escalated quickly
I‚Äôve missed my sweet prince
Wha? I'd love more background on this.
Yeah, I read that the first time. Nobody is forcing you, other than yourself.

I'm proud that this is the first response I see.

Bit too left for me lol
I can honestly say I didn't know a single guy in highschool that put on makeup lol

Not gonna happen, pure delusion I *aggressively* call this ridiculous bluff
‚ÄúRichtofen breaks the cycle!‚Äù
That was such awful bandaid application. Like what the fuck.
They listened in a way.. they just executed it in such a way that makes us pay 3-5x over what we should be paying for skins.
I always worry about my facial expressions. You're not alone there.
Maybe you feel a pressure to succeed and that makes it harder to do so
"Also, [NAME] has reached the ""retweet fans pressuring him to run"" stage of unofficially running."
I accidentally drop acid all the time. It's pretty commonplace, from what I hear. Just hang out at home.
Thank you brother
The fact that you put [NAME] above [NAME] is proof that you‚Äôre a troll or mentally handicapped.
oof okay, thanks for the info. Hopefully he fares better with our line/TE's
The intelligence of the average houston driver doesnt make this possible
The rhyme scheme is amazing

[NAME] queen will live until he is 86 years old. Thts what reverse flash said so its the damn truth
"My ""three B's"" were specifically moderate guys who'll pull support from [NAME]. There's not much overlap between [NAME] base and hers."
This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
Not with that attitude we won't. There are some developments that may change your attitude in the very near future.
In fact I plan to start using them in my videos since I plan to make this year feel like 2009.
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt try to use a bone to get it out. It‚Äôll only make it worse.

So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
Wow guns and ignorance. What else is wrong with her?
I am seeing my GP next week because I've been having other, more problematic thoughts. In NZ therapy is free if prescribed.
I wish that too.
What is an OL?
Which is stupid because conversations about race and slavery in America are primarily about race in slavery in America.
This is gross and sweet at the same time. Great parenting.
I understand completely. People have no memory or understanding of the true horror of these diseases. I am truly glad you have decided to vaccinate. Blessings [NAME]

I always wanted to be an actor! Always found it fun to emulate and/or imitate others
i smell a sitcom!
woah this is a reversal of the norm you took a meme from instagram to reddit
I too am a vaginal flap surrounded by useless flesh. Let us fly into the sunset and get raped.

Had to go way too far down the thread for this answer!
BUT I STILL HAD ALL THEEEEEESE
[NAME], keep going man
Depends who's there. If [NAME] is there, I hope that's where they go. If not, I want a pass rusher.
lovely! the real grass and metal roses compliment each other.
It‚Äôs supposed to be. But ol [NAME] snuffed a few out that he could have otherwise put clothes on and sent home.
While I love the brutality of Odyssey, my personal favorites were from Black Flag.

This was legit the first thought that came to me when I saw them there at the podium
You deserve this
The leader of the revolutionaries would be exploiting the labor of the revolutionaries below him!
Thank you for taking the time to respond.
"Yes. ""You better settle down over there or I'm gonna come talk to ya."""
Don't judge our love
Well sure his one appearance in relief lost us a game, but at least he didn‚Äôt get hurt. 
[NAME] would have cost [NAME]. I don‚Äôt blame them For saying no to that.
All of troomtroom videos on YouTube are this odd and unnecessary. Some even more so. And their thumbnails are interesting
Ya, definitely gotta not feel like a [NAME] sometimes too. 
I‚Äôve only been there once but really enjoyed it!! But I think it‚Äôs missing a pool table ;)
It‚Äôs a pretty good guess for most college students in the south in my experience.
We need an irbe so bad right now. I hope [NAME] is that guy

Was waiting for them to do it again with him out of the truck
Maybe they'll change their mind one day! That sounds good, I'll give it a go some time!
Seriously. I legit laughed at this.
"Nothing makes me exit a video faster ""looking at this made my nipples hard"" üôÑ"

Gifts are bugged. Your friend didn't get the chest, but somebody else did.
I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. 
Thank you. We're as messed up and fallible as any other set of parents, but we're trying to learn from our mistakes.
Yeah they are! I didn't realize that, it must be the case. Thanks!
These moments happen. Even if he was hella cold when he got home, you dont threaten a man. He may be stubborn enough to call your bluff 
You didnt even ask the parents if they agreed to let him in the back?
Huh. That‚Äôs kind of crazy.
I am still just a little salty that he isn‚Äôt.
i‚Äôm fking crying lmaoooo

Suddenly, the **average** block confirmation became an unchangeable API paramter? Wow. Just wow.

Oooh that's so sweet,she sounds like a good and caring mother. Does your dad know?
Well yeah, you've gotta paint it white yourselves

Have you talked to your group and [NAME] about him?
Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.
the whole summit ice r/nathanforyou episode is amazing.
What is beautiful about this planet? Nature is cold, harsh and full of suffering and pain. There is nothing beautiful at all about it. 
Are you joking? 538 has him hovering around -15 net approval. He won‚Äôt win unless Dems nominate someone like [NAME] again at this rate.
That's pretty much ALL complaining...
He went to UW, what do you expect?!
I love how they have it on the dog. Imagine a fur missile going after a suspect flashing red and blue.
Obvious satire lol

People aren't currently talking about taking in more refugees so you won't hear word one about helping homeless vets.

More QUAD BRICKS
Oh good lord what did I create
Any good reading on [NAME]? I don't really know if I like her or not.
Almost all cars go through auctions at some point. It's nothing to worry about.
Her booty so thicc it bends the space/time continuum
My hero!

Beyond that, it affirms the idea that discipline and habit exist for as long as you maintain them, which I find kinda funny. 
I love to see the Celtics give up [NAME] and [NAME] only to have [NAME] walk to literally any other team
I have an idea. Hear me out in this. Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt get upset about [NAME] until.... they...sign... elsewhere? Too radical?

Imagine seriously considering [NAME] as a nominee, what a joke.
great win leading into memphis. everyone contributed, awesome team basketball and defense throughout

Its probably just related to something she is dealing with. Stress/anxiety often causes nightmares. But there are plenty of potential

That‚Äôs beyond disgusting in every way.
Classic [NAME] right there ü§£
I hate people using the [NAME] to look ‚Äúdeep‚Äù on instagram posts like that. It gets on my nerves so much

Cool post. I just wish the game had more enemies besides just the spartan and athens army (like harpies, giant snakes, something like that). 
She met [NAME] after.
She is beauty she is grace she just just grinded the ground with her face.

My life has been destroyed
I liked TB 18, too bad it tanked.

Old man yells at cloud
North Central exactly... Poor dude's name is [NAME]. Popped right back up and finished the game...
Yet when you decided to fish for validation by sending someone nudes, you chose the masculine, handsome, man.
Considering my wife barely touches me, I think I could get this job. Wonder how much it pays. 
[NAME] was piss poor today
Considering that was a very early episode of SU, making tall trans women feel good is awesome :D
Not really if they are busy. They may not even take a break. But again if they are regularly not responding than it is probably an issue.
Me too, me too. But if it‚Äôs with anybody but [NAME] piloting the thing, I will cry big salty tears.
I hope you figure out what to do! It is real shit situation and it is awful what he said to you.
Cause she's being doing drag for the amount of my lifetime lol
But the last scene I saw was just [NAME] bringing the kid to her no talk of leaving was there a scene where [NAME] reconciles with [NAME]
"""There's always a bigger fuckup."""
Yeah, I really thought [NAME] would take his game to the next level coming here, not a big step back. Hopefully consistency will help him out. 
DRAG HER QUEEN
It always upset me that [NAME] would require his only son to do this I no longer believe it
I went there once and was like ‚Äúyeah neat I guess‚Äù around the same time. Totally forgot about it until I saw the pic of the door

TBH I think they would've been better without the hot dog
I think [NAME] does a great job! Can't believe she's 56...she looks amazing!
>very good teams and perfect situations Situations such as.... [NAME] at the Knicks? Lmao dude, give it up. 
It's due to the fee we have to pay since we aren't buying an electrical company from Washington state.
Or they drop out cause they have no interest in learning the language (a lot of kids do this unfortunately)
I hope [NAME] has something cooking. I wanted [NAME] back

No because thats stupid
Not really. My group of friends are awesome in every way possible except they are homophobic

Run. Dandududududud
I'd expect this from an actually attractive person but this is just lol
Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.
Yay! Congrats!
You can still check your feelings and then see how they‚Äôre messing up your facts.
Her elitism is what earned her the place here. She's clearly a lefty statist.
Looking at thngs that way can also help with confidence. Realizing that it doesn't matter can be quite freeing.
Hey, that's ok
Had a stroke reading these.
Probably would just tell him to not worry about it that much and wait a bit and try again if he felt like it was worth it

5,000 years ago.
 cute, new driver still cares. Come back in 4 months and u will be showing pictures of that bag thrown on the trunk. 
Yeah so I got kicked from a group chat for gnoming people*
And to think we roast them for it...
Not to mention there was a HUGE EXPLOSION only moments ago. The whole area could've been rigged with bombs for all they knew.
I really like Funhaus
Damn, I want some! 
LOVE THIS!!
Anything on Netflix really
i would feel really uneasy knowing i can never visit other countries, i think i would rather have the 50K
Vaccines turk err jerbs!
It's a troll. Look at the history.
Guilty of doing this tbph
This...is so beautiful. The stuff of dreams for sure. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The fact that it has so many up votes is baffling to me. Why would anyone care?
Bundle up and sled! Make a snowman! Take a walk through the wonderland!
Had surgery at 3mnths old to fill a pinhole in my back (spinabifida) Cutting myself after some severe postpartum depression
It‚Äôs disgusting
When people don't understand things they invent gods. how little we have changed in all these years.
I agree. That should be the core. [NAME] will be an elite defender
Don't bother, redditors hate Israel 
Thank you. I will look into the protein possibility.
And [NAME]. That dude sucks.
Man I want AD but I love OG ::(( guess we gotta sacrifice eh...
I always thought the swat was trash because I was looking at the MP TTK and only did I realise recently that MP guns and BO guns handle differently
We don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù but it was reported he is expected to stay on. Really glad about it
I could believe it's natty transformation, just not in so short time-frame. Hence, juicy or time-frame is closer to 2 years.
Wouldn't surprise me. I only had it happen once and it was a long time ago.
Check out the name of the guy above me I was just making an EFT joke
I was too busy looking at the glitch in the Matrix at 0:07.
Find a better partner. It's past time to move on! He sounds very lazy, selfish, and he doesn't care about your needs.
Thanks [NAME]. We hardly knew ye
Lakers truly have the worst fans
I don't like football but the 10 minutes of actual football has been pretty entertaining so far
Because only the hardiest folk stick around in a country where the air can kill you for 6 months of the year
Well, flash bangs go bang, too, to temporarily deafen and disorient, so there's that.
What this guy said but with a little more cocaine and a drinking problem.
Dying like hero‚Äôs. What better way to die than saving the world. You‚Äôre right.
Hahahaha. I can picture it as if I was a fly in the walll. I love mj like [NAME]
I watch it because I enjoy it
Whatever it is it‚Äôs not even worth hearing
let's hope it gets better.
As a non-legalistic [NAME], I wholeheartedly agree. :)
Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.
[NAME] is a fucking trooper
This was the most fun I've had watching a game since [NAME] 35 point game
I love this
She's stricter in the source material, I believe. Disney, as usual, watered her down. (No offense to the wonderful [NAME].)
If Gold state can make it work with 4 all stars we damn sure can with two players
Has it been confirmed fake yet? Or is it just really obvious that it's fake?
There‚Äôs a 9/11 chance he‚Äôs juicy.
I dont know how this is a joke. BUTT, I appreciate the effort.
That looks like an expensive hobby.
Hardcore Henry.
Same boat here, man.
My names Welsh and only 5 letters and even that is too hard for most people.
Excuse me, I am a very polite roid monkey. 
Same here. Together 39, married 37. Me 61, her 60. Ok, times change but stability is everything. 
yeh he's very Sketchy. Though I'm guessing he tipped staff off in person rather than a call in.
While out at the beach for a weekend for her birthday. There was no final straw, I just wanted to. 
No one but they're mine and they protect me from facing the truth D:
Wow, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I trust better things are coming for you. 
Shame about him killing [NAME] on camera.
That sub bans and deletes anything that's not flattering to [NAME]. Don't expect anything other than ideology and cult behavior from those idiots.
This hits hard, sadly both of my relationships have been toxic so I've decided not to start any new ones until I start going to uni 
Dude, just keep killing her with kindness. She's the one that looks bad, not you.
wait they actually lost lmao. i stopped watching halfway cuz i thought SPY had it in the bag ^^^^andigotmywatchrewards
Here come the angry [NAME] stans ü§™üåπ
I have to see the rest [NAME]
You two seem nice.
Dude got owned by a glass of cider. He spent a full month roiling and gnashing his teeth in an existential nightmare because of sulphites.
Weird, never had a problem
Ah, see that makes ALOT more sense to me, and how I believed prayer works. Thanks for that
I aint going back. This is going turn [NAME]‚Äù to ‚Äúunconditional love‚Äù big facts.
I'd punt her to another planet if she said that about my dog. Wtf is wrong with people. üò†
I feel attacked
Why on earth couldn't she just bring a hat from home if it was such a big issue to her? Lol.
Oh, fuck off. It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault but yours that you think every mention of the word ‚Äòmen‚Äô means you specifically. 
"Well, I **NEVER**! ""Lady, you really *should*."""
Great tag :)
[NAME] isn‚Äôt even a homer at this point. He‚Äôs just dumb.
Man i wish [NAME] expelled you for forgetting your minder binder instead
This is a solid list, and I will totally allow Scream to count. Surprised to see 10 Things below She's All That tho.
Did you just equate the tomahawk chant to lynching as a reply to being called out for virtue signaling?
It is so ugly I felt personally attacked by it, what can I say
Calm down.
Sounds like an edgy 14 yo that just had his first kiss
He‚Äôs just awesome. It‚Äôs refreshing in a celebrity
Im hoping for a relapse too. I like her better, her hair gets darker, her leather jacket comes out. I miss private practice [NAME]
So you lucky you won as you work illegal teach. Glad you leave.
Wow thanks I gotta try this!
It‚Äôs a way of recognizing someone‚Äôs comment/post. It‚Äôs basically a thing that you buy for someone to help support reddit.
I don't know what she is talking about. Therefore i will say that she is DEFINITELY WRONG AND SHOULD SHUT UP! /s
It taunts you
I came here to tell you that this wins this sub and I‚Äôll never be able to finish reading it.
Another nipple man, we should form our own Subreddit
I mean do what you want but I've always thought that's a good way of getting pink eye.
It's a people problem, not an evil man problem. So if their perspective always paints men as the perpetrator, their perspective is flawed.
I think the issue is this feels like green washing
Some idiot talks shit to one woman - > SOCIETY shames WOMEN for BEING ALIVE
He looked pretty into it when talking with [NAME]
An entire family gone within minutes... how absolutely heartbreaking.
Could this be both proof that [NAME] exists *and* that he has a sense of humor?
ThE SkY iS FaLLiNg!
I think we'll find out how apt this comparison is within the next few years.
It's fascinating how each language originated isn't it but the how it happened is beyond my scope.So I don't dwell much upon it.
We still have one somewhere at home. Decades old, comes from Russia.
I'm having a woosh moment here.
You did so good for yourself though! If you had the mother you deserve she would have the sense to be proud of you. :)
The loading screen has the circle at the bottom that just keeps spinning. I tried uninstalling the app and that didn't work either.
Of course not.
Wow, im the opposite. In year 2 of being apart now.
Besides [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME], he was the most skilled LoA member.
Both sides have extended offers to end the shutdown since it has started, I think it's disingenuous to act like this is completely one sided. 
Lmao that [NAME] damn nic cage pillow
Download it again.
Congratulations! Idk how long you've been living here, but welcome to Colorado!! :D I hope you're enjoying it!
I would never have believed it. Having experienced it, it is true. Completely. Different. World.
My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid
"I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
This is just sad. So, so sad.
It is heated overnight at much cheaper rates. They are very well insulated.
Whew! I‚Äôm glad [NAME] was caught. I hope you‚Äôll never have to deal with her again.
Amazing, my friend üôè 
Good night, sweet prince. I hope it was a quick one.
oh man [NAME] is the guy that said the show saved his life, love ya buddy
He‚Äôs probably just getting stressed out that it is now getting dark and he lives in the countryside
Thanks hehe hit me up on there sometime!
Believe me if they were there I would go for it.
Leading after 3!!!
I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.
The stupid is real
Don‚Äôt kink shame me!
He raped you. Leave. Now. Cut all contact. Easy answers here. You deserve far far better than this
If you need to vent or anything, let me know. I'd be glad to chat or even just listen, whatever helps. Stay strong!
>[NAME] and [NAME] As alternate costumes of each other, right? Not as separate characters?
Do you work in education?
Sucks to suck
Mmmm traveling for work often isn't exactly the most desirable situation. It can be exhausting.
My balls shrunk up looking at that
Bold of you to assume that I have two other friends
[NAME] I hate this
I like this
Congratulations! I know it‚Äôs a hard thing to quit, I‚Äôm proud of you. 
That's what I thought, but upon closer inspection it's missing the Ontario shield of arms.
I don‚Äôt see anything awful on her. She‚Äôs old. That‚Äôs it.
Awe your such a big boy
Invisible Monsters is amazing. I'd say it should be made into a movie, but that would be difficult.
Oh right I was for reason thinking it was just made out with. Sleep with is even better. Sleep with [NAME], [NAME]! 
U gotta work hard to get those virgins son.
"op says ""a couple busses is also fine"" hop on the 15l, 2 stops and a 1 block walk gets you to the snug."
[NAME] breaks to love early in the third.
He's a cool guy, he just had a rare lapse in to verysmart territory 
You don‚Äôt see a parallel between the two scenarios?
Pop doesn't like it sloppy
He looks like [NAME] in Jackass 2 when they glued pubes to his face.
Nope, not really
I‚Äôm glad you had such a helpful person on the other end during a tough situation, those kinds of people are like angels‚ù§Ô∏è
I was picturing [NAME]
I bet everyone is commenting hoping to get plat or gold......i dont blame them
For that tropical flavor
That's because real anarchism is anti-capitalist, shove a knife up your urethra nerd.
That‚Äôs a fuckin budgie. You gotta be a moron at birds to not know that. That‚Äôs like Bird Basics 101.
I don't see sedimentation layers, but that could just be the picture quality. I'm going to guess this is likely just a chunk of granite.
Vote for a commie and she will be making that decision.
SATURDAY! SATURDAY! SATURDAY!
Like I said, his route running is as good as it's ever been, but he isn't as explosive after the catch anymore
It was once was mine too. Im starting to use it again. :) It is so fucking beautiful,
As someone who is not based in America and has the basic understanding of a toddler about molecular science in terms of football, why do you hate him?
Everyone knows the good [NAME] are the dirty little devil's
Everybody is just temporarily embarassed millionaires
I won't even reply anymore. That radio silence mid convo really gets on my nerves.
I'm glad you realize that [NAME] is part of the problem and not the solution.
Ah the ole pelvic buster
Happy Birthday [NAME]!
I dont know how to send a PM on Sync/mobile, so I'll be asking here?
My hair never scrunched and I was so jealous
Oh my [NAME]...
You‚Äôve become the very thing you swore to destroy
I'm so sorry
[NAME] isn‚Äôt a rocket scientist. I was surprised about the Thailand thing tbh I did expect it to be true haha.
Yeah, without the music that scene would have been much worse.
"""These people didn't go to my church therefore they are demonic"""
oh ok thanks for explaining
My partner and I have 17 years between us! Best and healthiest relationship I have been in :)
You already used that one my abusive buddy.
Well thanks. Maybe if i make any money we can set royalties up.
was never caught by my parents when jerking off, but had a few close calls.
That's the worst possible outcome
>GTAV Eh GTA SA is like 10x better than V in terms of music, story, replayability, and characters.
Oh awesome! I didn't even notice your name until now lol
Not that surprising, but *very* exciting to see! Here‚Äôs hoping Syria reclaims its place as a major regional industrial and commercial center!
I don't believe humanity is capable of running *any* system for the greater good of all. Regardless of population..
Uhh. Okay. Lol.
That‚Äôs cool. I didn‚Äôt know they had cameras like that. Thank you for sharing :)
Homelessness may not be a crime but loitering and public camping certainly are.
WHY IS THERE WOMAN ON MY ENTERTAINMENT??????????
Thank you :) I was starting to seriously wonder if something was majorly wrong with my maternal instincts haha
Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
These parents probably dress and openly love the kid more
It's giving me old school [NAME] vibes.
lots of games have already added what he's asking for, i don't know why he asked the question 
I like how everyone is being so mysterious about the proof that has convinced them
bcash is not bitcoin. its a fork if bitcoin, and you brought up [NAME] yourself which is pretty odd considering you think of him as a distraction.
[NAME] creeps them out.
What are you on about man, those are just rollerblades for fancy occasions 
there's an entire street in my neighborhood that's lined with 80+ year old magnolias on both sides. It's amazing.
I agree with everything you said, except the Witten part he is [NAME] awful....that whole MNF crew makes it unwatchable.
I was thinking 1-2 in each eye might stop the threat, but if I'm being honest I'd be worried about the ensuing legal struggle...
Same here. I had a lot of swelling but not abnormal pain.
Going by the dates given, this child was born in 1985. So Mom really cared about this in the 80s. 
FaceTime with wifey!! Happy anniversary!
Sounds like a man child, why don't he get it. 
I don‚Äôt cry, either. It‚Äôs weird. I think it‚Äôs a personality/mentality thing. Just depends on how your brain is wired I think
Thank you! That's the nicest thing I heard today! I hope you get the same positive energy you put in out ten fold!
Yeah, local subs are always like this massive turf war between various astroturf factions. It's kind of bizarre. 
It‚Äôs more like a bunch of vaguely veiled racists and sexists and MAGAtards. Unless that‚Äôs what you consider ‚Äúgood.‚Äù
Gotcha, thanks. Sounds like it's just my ignorance of the game.
wow octane is pure garbage lmao
Men and women praying side-by-side doesn't make Israel any less of a [RELIGION] state.
But if I‚Äôm not mistaken [NAME] said in his draft interviews that he can speak something like 5 different languages. So one of them could be Italian
Same. But the 21 point lead drew me in.......who knew you can lose by double digits leading by that much.
50% completion percentage and was losing 31-10 at the half. Congrats, he got garbage time yards/points when [NAME] was just icing the game. 
take my arrow. so fucking true
I‚Äôve come to the same realization. So now if its less than a pound I‚Äôm offering free shipping.
>But a leader who strikes fear Like when people were worried [NAME] might murder them?
Yelling anger sorrow. Not that funny to me.
Lol I didn‚Äôt mind group projects much, I only did when I didn‚Äôt have friends in the class.
The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. 
heartless pores. ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a volleyball.‚Äù it was his friend!
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can run as long as one of your parents is a US citizen (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).
I'm kind of glad they aren't letting you. Just you, not everyone else.
my [NAME] this is just *yes*
Drives to work, realizes its a holiday because nobody answers their phones. Still stuck at work... nothing to do. We dont get paid holidays :(
Oh. Damn.
Congratulations on your shiny spine! I really hope your boyfriend backs you up but even if not, we all do! 
Hello from McAllen too ‚ô•Ô∏è
Wait did [NAME] steal that name from the pinkerton guy?
No i didn‚Äôt all i know is that i binged 3 seasoms of it.
Your pro controller tho, tops.
I believe that this may be meant for the person above me, for I have moved into the realm of monetized bananas. 
Sorry, I have a lot of friends like this she won‚Äôt stop it‚Äôs like they get addicted . . . 
My exam is over and my winter break starts now üéâüéâüíÉ I've been waiting for this omg
So it's we now eh jerk-off, as in troll farm to creat FUD and drive the premium up on the order book. I knew it.
This happened to me recently. She was doing her thing and I was watching Rick and Morty. Wubalubadubdub
After he left the bus, the two harpies sat next to each other and discussed why they were unable to find a decent man.
"PR is more than just ""optics"". It ain't a new term either. "
Can't remember how many times i died there. Death is easy if you keep spamming holy water in the corner
So THATS how he got the room for that backhanded top 10 nhl goal...
My goodness I didn't even know this existed. This is my first time seeing something like this. Pretty cool stuff.
Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day
[NAME] as family!?!?! I NEED TO KNOW MORE.
no. Queef is vaginal period. I call it mumbles, when the lips move but you can't understand what they are saying.
Disturbing =/= awful. Its incredibly well done by a professional. I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness, not purposeful shock value/ theatrical makeup.
ITLL BE OKAY MOUNTAIN FRIEND, JUST ACCEPT IT
[NAME] eyebrows! Her highlight!
Hopefully no one was sitting on his lap at the time!
This is such a cool idea. Basically an abathur that hats minions instead of heroes.
wow so almost every sub has grown a lot in 7 months. Also 8.3k!! what!? that's insane
I'm glad she made it as easy on you as possible.
I was joking about the flowers, BTW. I love flowers.
I feel I should do this even after living here for 7 years, I've barely done any touristy things! Shame on me.
This would be cool for a kids science project about conductors and why metal is such a good conductor
Well that sucks
Confusingly, they also want less rights for [NAME].
I need to amend: Fuck the Patriots and fuck [NAME] in particular.
We can do this son. You don't want to miss [NAME] win his first Rumble and become the new top guy.
Yeah I really hope nobody was in the back seat of the red car... I hope everyone is okay.
"Who knows, he could say ""rough"" and I could wind up in handcuffs."
What was the wooosh
You sound fun at parties
Thank you. You too.
Well, ok then nevermind. I'm surrounded by people I mostly disagree with, but I honestly don't know anyone that I would call outright evil. 
I‚Äôm just gonna sit here for a minute
You have an amazing boss. You're so lucky.
Make sure you say hi to her next time you see her.
People don‚Äôt think it be like it is, but it do
Actually a good idea. Starbucks, breakfast sandwiches, donuts... all fine excuses unless you work at one of those places.
Yes, this. I love this film.
I hear ya. I got instant Sapphic feelings as soon as i enrolled at university here.
I was living for him. Now he left me. I'm not gonna live anymore.
Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. 
I hope an elk will gore anyone whose still using [NAME] jokes in 2019
Glad to see it resolved by someone as the community manager said not too long ago. I wouldn't give in and pay.
Interesting, I'll scoop some
I assume the [NAME] announcement doesn't mean that his contract money comes off of the payroll?
Ah so that's what it is. Here I was thinking it was douchebags cutting cords off appliances so no one could reuse them
Yes. You fucking troll me every time. Fuck you.
> weird ass-coments *** ^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^xkcd#37
> busy blasting stuff with plasma Sound like more fun.
lol it‚Äôs pretty tame compared to r/Titlegore
What is the least confusing racism to you
I'm sure they'll rob them back off her in no time
It took me a while, but then I realized your friend was one of the ‚Äúweird guys‚Äù
Ye is dragging a wagon
I also love this decline in bch prices. Cheers.
You all need to move the f out of your parents house!
This was the one post that truly frightened me about the insane left. They are a cult, and not on our side.
Your mental gymnastics are absolutely astounding
when they finally do eat a decent meal, the will blow up like a balloon!
The question wasn‚Äôt phrased well, but she does look different than her normal self in this screencap
This one is sad but also very good
It's pretty warm in Australia during this time of year.
I can‚Äôt think of any at the moment but I just wanted to say I love [NAME] lol.
Bless your heart
To check if someone was home? Someone answers the door, he just plays dumb and asks for directions or something. 
I get ya man. It happens to the best of us.
His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.
That's great you guys have been together so long. Do you take any medicine like prep?
If you like this than go watch My Self Reliance on YouTube. Start from the beginning. Very relaxing and fun.
wow! thats... a lot of water my dude was your bladder ok
Cried when [NAME] and [NAME] gave each other a big hug and [NAME] lifted him off the ground.
I just had an overabundance of fudge. I took several pounds to my regular dispensary and they were thrilled.
it's the result of a structural problem inherent in all forms of vanguardism, though. it's not the result of MLs being fascists or not leftists
I want you to, please tell me.
As a Jeep driver, I constantly have to remind other Jeep drivers that 4WD/AWD only makes a difference when driving. Everyone has 4-wheel stop.
Loved that show, but [NAME] put me right off it. Like fingernails down a chalk board.
Oh mah gawd!!
He's active tonight
My type of cheerleader. Those are some good looking guys
Let's watch impractical jokers!
[NAME] !!!
Just got my seats a couple of days ago!
No Problem!
Sorry for your loss. Thoughts and prayers.
Just split for gods sake before kids are born.
Wow this team has no clue what to do against this right now. There has to be 15 turnovers already.
If you‚Äôre downloading from windows I believe so
2016 was also the worst year of my life
Hello! Happy new years my friend!
Thank you so very much for this. Our culture seems to frown upon the mindset of leaving them out to dry.
Oh my gosh, my Dodger blue heart goes out to yours and your family. I am so sorry.
Yep, it is public and others waiting for their case are there. 
how much money can the raptors offer [NAME]? Can he get a supermax here in toronto after this season?
Man my siblings would never just kill me like that
unrelated, but i love your flair
Sorry lol, that‚Äôs left over from a lot of parenting and relationship subreddits. 
Food stamps are a disgrace. People should get money!
You know I‚Äôm not the only one that stole a meme and posted it in other subreddit, right? 
Lol do it.. then block him again
So you were triggered by that term in particular?
Does not giving the puck away in the defensive zone every single fucking time he touches it count as an elite level skill?
Read the title of this post. I said ugly people can be LIKED. But people don‚Äôt truly FALL IN LOVE with physically unattractive people
He's the only legitimate jetpacker
Bengals are a quirky breed üò∏
Ice at the office sounds like such a luxury to me! I wish!
That's exactly what I said and not arguing in bad faith at all. I applaud your intellectual honesty and hope your sexually repressed dystopia is swiftly enacted.
Don't forget about foden, I love [NAME], I even bought his shirt at the start of this season, but foden has an even greater ceiling
Bunch of incels
these are quite normal thoughts for depressed people
I've never seen a more adorable tumble
And what‚Äôs your thoughts on that specific scenario? Now I‚Äôm curious.
Does the world really need this?
I hope she figures out he isn‚Äôt before anything happens. The entitlement herre is just over the roof
[NAME] 10 year challenge is looking good!
I know exactly
That might be the first accurate thing you‚Äôve said today! (You‚Äôre merely a couple of decades late.)
Not trolling. Anger issues. I'm sorry for previous comments.
Just watched the ET interview and it really was good! Love that hoodie strategy haha
From the looks of his haphazard flailing it seems he needs to go back to the dojo...
We don‚Äôt like to talk about that
You have a very justifiable reason to be upset and vent. I am this happened to you.
Nah not today
Ugh I know it's wishful thinking but I'm praying to mayor [NAME] for a DC gov closure
Is this really a thing? I‚Äôve never heard of this in my life
believe me, it almost did for me. if i was a woman my panties would have dropped instantly. lol
Wow thanks. Didn‚Äôt know there were any others glad to hear
Twisted pair is actually a type of cable. Fits into his weird relationship with communications technology.
You can always tell from the vote counts lol. They're way too blatant
U damn clown, she prolly felt so embarrassed and you‚Äôre just like meh
That does suck. I‚Äôm sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it‚Äôs a terrible feeling
So you stay on your theft from auto waiting for them to dispatch the next shift to the backlog of calls.
I had no idea but seeing this things make so much more sense...
"Watch the movie ""The Big Short"". You'll love it. Promise."
I wanna hug my mom dead named me waking me up for school
Woah woah woah... people have different taste? Stop trying to give me some perspective!
Do you have a source for this claim. Seems promising but would love to dig into it.
If his seat was vacant, would there be a special election in 2020 if it happened soon? Not wishing him dead or whatever.
I thought you would say it was because Finland doesn‚Äôt really exist.
I absolutely think this is possible, and for the good of our team: *TOLES FINDS DEM HOLES!*
Considered going for the 1st time this year, then I see all the ads targeting kids specifically. Feels weird as a 26 year old seeing all this..
Thanks, I love it 
Oh wow I love this!
You should be flattered he wants to have sex with you!
He did. Dems would have filibustered and you need 60 votes to force one to end.
Haha! [NAME] aside, that is *wonderful*!
This happened to me in the same hour of the discard! Went from shouting to supportive friend within 45 mins.
I think teams will still cut the cross-seam that made [NAME] and [NAME] so deadly last year. This is awesome nonetheless.
[NAME] did it first
Practice your speech before hand. In your head and in the physical world. Then keep doing it until it no longer scares you.
With ice time and his defensive liabilities taken into consideration, I'm still not too high on him
As someone with sinus and breathing problems, this makes me anxious and short of breath just looking at it.
This thread is being brigaded by atheist/agnostics. They are just here to cause trouble. Look at OPs post history.
I only eat cronuts cuz I'm sophisticated!
Evil man.
I like how the last picture is of [NAME] beaming smile and not even so much about the tattoo at all.
Then leave him. You're not married and sexually comparability is a huge part of making a relationship work. Don't underestimate this my friend.
I'd be more worried about the kids needing eye protection at that point.
I am so pissed about Oiler hockey right now. Even [NAME] is annoying me and I love [NAME]. Gaaaahhhhhhh
I am assuming since it's shut down, no one can access the website to change these things. They are most likely delayed.
Why did you post my autobiography
looks like your fake autism you used to use for attention still has its side effects :/
My point is that IQ basically works. As with literally everything, there are flaws, but it's not junk science. 
If only they were more like [RELIGION] amirite?
I've seen some unfunny comment sections on r/jokes but this one takes the cake.
Why? He was always brilliant. It was such a shame he lost out to [NAME]. Things would have been very different today...
[NAME] got really better after his confrontation with [NAME].
cheers friend. same thing happened to me 2 days ago. hazzah!
Sorry my teams gave you your only two losses this season ;)
ALFBRUSHJANSBYSY SUCH A GOOD DOGGO
Haven't played in forever, but [NAME] solo was my jam back in the day. Glad to hear damage tanks are still good
I will! This is a great new excuse for never leaving my house
Neither have I
First of all, sorry for your loss. Keep in mind that funerals are for the people still alive not the person who has just died.
The second one protects all the others and also I don't know all the others!
Its one thing to LOSE a debate, its another to be disqualified for wrong think. 
These Red Dead Redemption graphics are amazing
That‚Äôs about what ours is, but our rush hour traffic is horrible.
I have a Secrets engagement ring, I love it, cost 1/10th of a real diamond and no one can tell. Would highly recommend!
keep everything well hydrated
Women always seem to write that though, plus emotipns and emojis. When a man writes likr that it comes off odd ajd feminine in a bad way.
Somebody lied to her several hundred times
These style skins remind me so much of hollow knight
I can't wait until I can get my app up and running now.
[NAME]? (joke)
Watch Vegan Gains‚Äô video on that, he had it when he was like 13, highly doubt he was juicing then
lol, you dieded
You know they just blamed the neighbor who defended themself.
This is the first time I‚Äôve ever been reposted. I‚Äôm honored
And often the failing is in the laws. Having to prove somebody is a danger to you is part of the problem!
I think he's a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, lazy, wrathful, envious, and prideful man. 
I think it was Volantis, but yeah I agree.
This is hilarious
I would love to hang out with him & listen to his stories
Well, to them that probably was the polite term! That's funny though lol
It‚Äôs not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.
The most my dad did to help with the housework in 35+ years of their marriage was to lift his legs while mum vacuums around the couch
Exactly what I came here to write lol
It can't be, I won't believe it.......this is some antivawers bulls**t xD
bet he loves to slow dance
ITT: People defend delusional shitposts.
I meant mainsource [NAME]. the one that assists you on your journey. >! not the one that is evil as fuck!<
Your idea of the supposed limitations of bots is actually hilarious.
Look I don‚Äôt mean to be rude but w
A stunning place, you will need lots of cuddles to stay warm though!
I‚Äôll buy every colourpop collab she does. Good formulas. I love supporting [NAME] and it‚Äôs AFFORDABLE. What more do u want? üòÇ
"Let me remind you that I'm 5'6"" and I still think all that thinking is ridiculous."
[NAME] would laugh and hang up if this was the offer
Was almost hit by some idiot yesterday that drove straight through a red light and into a crossing.
You were in a movie once!
Try reading up. Not going to play these stupid games with a butt hurt Meltzer fan boy.
That's just defeatist.
Unfriend this kid in all ways possible. Sucks for both of you, but this could be much worse. 
Good [NAME] we look horrible
Give it 3 days, when every MSM outlet quietly retracts the story.
For some reason, I thought this was one of his Bros trying to save him from her.
Wonder where all the shit is.
Once I saw who posted the video, I was certain I knew who it was, and I was right. Glad to see him back in action!
I don't know why he'd take it like that, he was gone for so long so someone was going to do a show like that.
Wow that's so litüî•üî•üî•üòÇüòÇüí¶üí¶üí¶ im so proud of your autistic son for making it LOL OUT LOUD üëèüëèüëèüí¶üí¶üí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüòòüòò
Instagram literally fueles my eating disorder, I can't have it. It is all fake though
Anyone else think this is a little wholesome? I mean he‚Äôs really getting to his limit for this chick it seems.
I wish to die with my will and spirit intact!
like 2lbs worth of potato and toppings at her grandmas every damn day. I love that show as well
I think we can all agree that this is the right answer.
My first thought
I agree it‚Äôs disrespectful to so blatantly disregard her parents wishes but yes, otherwise too uptight.
Lol it‚Äôs one of those right wingers pretending to be a leftist to sow division. They‚Äôre pretty bad at it.
Hahaha yes, exactly!
Outside of Belpedio we really don't have a lot of decent call ups on D. PS It's amazing how much [NAME] has improved this year.
They feel so bad they post it on Twitter
You‚Äôve got a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. 
Not sure why you're being downvoted
"I did! Never moving back, I love my life in the ""big smoke""."
Thanks a lot. That will give me some things to google.
This was funny the first time, now this jokes been beaten to death so badly.
what a stupid opinion
Haven't been able to watch tonight and just saw the score. What is happening?!
Lame passing all night
Not a good sound, a glorious sound.
You know damn well it is.
I know very well what Whole Foods is, which makes it all the more upsetting that I missed the joke anyway
I dont believe you
I'm not trolling. This push for pro vaccines just seems strange.
I'm confused on the hov +2 part, does that mean that's price if you split the bill?
I like how he called his mom asking if she was trying to contact him just so he could tell her what‚Äôs wrong
The climate change committee is pretty toothless and would rather see it have more power, happy it exists at least. 
Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
Launching a jab is a hard commitment though, right? Because I doubt you can react fast enough to seeing them jab and launch them.
A girl known as daddy... well that‚Äôs a new twist on an old trick
That is awesome to know. I‚Äôm moving back to Chicago in August.
Loved every part of this series so far!! Keep up the good work!
p.s. make sure to pay your tithing, and GENEROUS offerings, which all totally go to help the poor.
Uh . . . Uh . . . I'm not feeling so well.
This could have been done in two panels and that‚Äôs honestly what annoys me the most about this
My wife enjoys marking me. We just make sure they are below the collar line.
Hugs to you It will get better
Now that's a frozen dessert I haven't eaten in a long time.. a long time.
I wish they had what they advertised. The end of that era was sometime in my teens.
They look the same way fighting as I do dancing
[NAME] MADE ME personally to eat BACON you ignorant vegans.
[NAME] stopped napping at 18 months. We‚Äôve been implementing quiet time since. It‚Äôs wondrous.
Die mad about it.
Man it‚Äôs easy to cut your wiener off. Easy!
Highgate Hill! Close to westend and has a lot of cute houses. :)
You give me too much credit... That comment is as trash as the meme
They are new but got over 100 reviews in less than a month so I'm assuming they are just slammed. Thanks for the input
This is what unions are for. The great only appear great because we are on our knees
Serious question. Can I be you
I accept your failure and wish you a good day.
"I've felt number 2 so hard. ""Working hard for what you don't want"" is a thing. :("
> lack of diversity in the cast now that's a new one lmao
We‚Äôre still commenting on a video of a dog farting and a cat throwing up right?
They look like some healthy multi grain version
Hmmmm this is so familiar but I can't quite put my finger on DJEEEOOOWWWOBRRRRBRBRBRRGRRRRRRDRRRRRRJRHRRJRRERHRJRGRHRRJRHRHRBRJ
Life must be difficult for her then, I'm surprised she can leave her home. Hopefully she finds help if she wants it. 
your joke sucks
I loved this place but I would only go for the big Blockbusters. It was the best IMAX theater in Minnesota hands down RIP
Dude is taking a huge leek
That sounds terrible! I get hay fever some years, I also have eczema and anxiety, all at once sounds like pure hell.
Maybe ask some neighbours if there have been any strange or noteworthy comings and goings during the day.
Just mad that you have to wait another 6 months for your cake day
Only 150 calories for two so it's not as awful as a tub of ice cream. Still a bad message, though
Those splits of Marla's still amaze me! Not only in terms of flexibility, but STRENGTH. Just imagine how heavy that leg is...
I feel like its got to do with the bad desync in the game right now.

If that's ice cream, then honestly I eat ice cream from a cup at home. It's great for portion control.
*pokes head in from Detroit* Hi! *waves!*
I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.
I just rewatched season 5. My god, I had forgotten how horrible [NAME] is. 
What? The claim is 2018 best shooters. Not overall best shooters
Uhhh... unfortunately I can't read the article due to some regulations...but pretty sure that post is just the article
And do they all follow her main account? See, she has fans, they just all happen to be her. Lol
FUCKING RIGHT COLIN WHITE AND OF COURSE MARK STONE
Wow - never seen negative karma before I clicked on your name lol.
I had a basketball coach who shattered his hand at halftime of a game doing that.
Is that even a debate anymore?
Alligator eats the bigger number
good to hear my man!
Nope. stories always fall apart, like in Ohio a few years ago. 
I‚Äôm gonna love it if that happens to me
Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives
Can you link in the full posted videos where they yelled about the wall ? Thanks.
but then you have it stick to your lips and give you one of those cold-sore lookin' burns.
Interesting. Is it cool to say colored person now?
Anyone who complains about being a loser is a loser.
*looks through comments* Who said it was going to be unbiased?

Monster hunter world is making me desperately want to stay up all night and play it. But I can't make it past 11pm anymore üò´
Guys, are you really sure those are men?
BTW does anyone watch peep show and have noticed how much [NAME] looks like [NAME]?
A little over 10k.
No you basically throwing him under the bus by posting him here.... fake natty suspicion 100%
It's crisp, no filler material. Interesting protagonists. Amazing music. Good way to spend 6 hours.
Yup, lost a whole train station inside of their houses. Great loss 
I did physics and maths, now in astrophysics. It's fun (except for stars, those suck).
Thanks!
Top ten nicest things anyone has ever said to me!
The way that was worded I can't tell if your super calm or about to flip a chair
Crosspost! We're cool with crossposts.
Feminist narrative... it's always the mans fault even when he's helping someone out, sleeping, and gets murdered.
[NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off
Yeah, i dont know bout you guys, but my parents were pretty anal about my room being clean.
Must've misunderstood something about his injury. Thanks for pointing it out
Why don't you just move to secular country like North Korea, China or Sweden? Leave theists alone we don't want you.
Paying respects?
I see , they don‚Äôt sell phones any more
Find like-minded people you can have meaningful conversations with. Everything else I consider a waste of my spare time.
In what fucking world is this drawing not bad
so true cuz i‚Äôm pretty miserable but my instagram life looks amazing
Why is there no equivalent sub for the wimminfolk (and anyone else who cares to join) to oogle in?
I respect your laziness.
yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers. 
Nobody has been banned lol
Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice.
I didn't realise
> I feel the big man deserves some love. Because people on places like /r/pcmasterrace doesn't treat him like the second coming of [NAME].
s p o o k y
Cool. Good luck!
This is wild omg. Also, happy cake day twin!
I'd bet that this falls under spamming and therefor I'll get banned soon :/ (please dont, I love this sub)
Korean is not that hard of a language as far as foreign languages go anyway Hahahahahaha, how long have you been studying for?
But milk is beta food! Who wants that girly ass shit from a boob? My child will drink bone broth and the tears of broken women!!
Nothing more Jersey than the sound of car horns over [NAME] rambling out an annoyed answer to a caller.
[NAME] is fucking destroying Bama and I LOVE IT
This wasn‚Äôt last year. It was last century! Star Wars had just come out!
>Allow insurance to not pay for treatment of diseases with known vaccinations and to raise rates on antivaxxers *Genius!*
I feel the same way! It just doesn‚Äôt get better for some of us, I‚Äôm sick of hearing that it gets better.
Looks like I posted it. Oh no!
Awesome ! That will be worth multitudes one day for certain. And such a classy gentleman, [NAME] is the best in NHL
I have no idea what arbitration even is but I'm going to react poorly
Especially when it's right in your FACE
Was not one of those players, still want to go back to the MW2 days. Totally would if I still had my PS3 :/
Omg she's gorgeous!
[Serious] I'm fairly certain this poster has Asperger's Syndrome or OCD or some other mental disorder. He obsessively fixates on really really weird subjects.
I actually got banned from vanilla sites for stuff like this lol. I think the guys get offended and flag your profile lol
What. No.
We just got a ninja coffee machine. Don‚Äôt even need filters! It has little waste besides the coffee grounds. I love it.
Lol, thank you!
Silence and For Greater Glory
How do you play 180+ hours and not know that taunt is already a thing? (Pick a fight, ventriloqy)
That's so good to hear and I know stress/anxiety is a factor but idk how to get rid of it, glad for you though.
I chose a name without my parents. Then when I told them the name, they said that's the name they had picked out if I was afab
It's happened:
I didn‚Äôt know you existed, but I‚Äôm thankful you do 
Keep up the good work
Either of those scenarios make sense. I'm getting antsy I need some positive Steelers news haha.
I blame [NAME] for this series of unfortunate events
I wish I could tell you if it was a good t.v. Let me just find the MOTHERFUCKING REMOTE!!!!!!!!
Well ya ideally should be cleaning piercings with sterile saline anyway sooo.
if its not for [NAME] i will combust into flames and I will die
Alright, so I googled aaaaaaand sorry for my misinformed mistake. Dunno where I heard that [NAME] didn't win the popular vote but it was wrong :(
I can only imagine the mud butt that comes with a bowl of DQ chicken and DUMPlings
I love the north east. Can‚Äôt say much for the rest though
Nope. Glad we came out with the W
OMG BARF wtf is wrong with people?!
Dude. There should be like...underpants with a huge pouch for your balls then. When you age those guys get so saggy.
And I *can* physically drink over 12 beers in a sitting. And my cat *can* physically jump out of the open window if he wanted to. Sigh.
Dude. I was hoping this would actually be helpful. I'm so tired of helping little kids open their milk cartons at the elementary I work at.
The huge attention paid by powerful male republicans takes makes a lot more sense when you consider this might be what they thought it was about.
Thanks for posting this. I'm going through the exact same but I wasn't gonna post anything about it.
i believe this is [NAME] from [NAME] on instagram!! her owners are so sweet
Take a upvote I'm glad I made your experience great
(#1)Just love him/her (#2) Be forgiving
Is this him?
Self defense should be, and this man sexually assaulted this woman.
I love you.
Wow excellent shot
Damn that was ugly
No, I was very interested in the game until this news broke. Now I‚Äôm a little disappointed. But at least I can opt-out. 
I‚Äôm blown away by how many people know this.
With [NAME] and [NAME] back, and [NAME] waiting in the wings, would you still want an EDGE in round 1?
Why, it'll be gone in 30 some odd games. 
And with the federal laws about how little time they can drive before forced breaks, they work less than any shithead salaried manager and great pay
I‚Äôm so happy for you. Congrats and thanks for the advice
He looks like a Spanish Solly March, so I‚Äôll assume he‚Äôs as average as Solly is. 
Eat healthy, get as much sleep as you can, and wear a mask when the little one comes along.
Not exactly starving though is it, so my point still stands.
I really wish the conversation surrounding masculinity had just an ounce of empathy for men, rather than just the pretense of empathy for men
I want to be a rapper. I also like to write poetry and stuff. So to be successful with those things also I want to design clothing.
 No one makes that argument, though, except strawmen invents by the right. 
DO NOT SAY ANYONE OTHER THAN [NAME] IS BETTER THAN [NAME] OR THE PITCHFORKS ARE OUT
As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass.
Oh? There's financial trouble in heaven? Lol
Yeah, empathy, a hell of a drug ;)
My man!
Gives me [NAME] 2005 bad memories.
I believe he means he was a very pretty child to become otherwise after puberty...
Yeah, but malice with the *intent* to solely intimidate OP? Doubtful. More like malice with the unlucky byproduct of discovery by OP.
Exactly. Last year we were saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry...next year we will get [NAME] or [NAME]. Or both.‚Äù What a joke 
I don't care. It's adorable.
did he give up out of embarrassment having knocked back chicago for us and then not getting to join us.
Yay!!!!! You‚Äôve got this!!!!
Yep! It's still busy. Slightly less crowded but still fun!
I‚Äôm *BEGGING* that they get it right by the time [NAME] shows up.
OMG!!
Yeah. If you try not to ignore the photos it's right there.
I need to find a term for this so badly.
Not really the point I'm making, but thanks.
I feel like this is coming to NV soon as well, and I‚Äôm not so sure about how it will go
You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
Nice pen.
I like [NAME]. Sue me.
All those statistics are nonsense. There has never been ‚Äútrue‚Äù capitalism.
Omgsh. What‚Äôs bad is if you look at her two years ago she looks normal and just beautiful and then it progressively gets scary
Big ol fesh
I've seen Shot Caller. That's what I've decided prison is... so yeah. Sorry boys.
Canada is full of nice people, but has also produced some pretty gnarly serial killers, so...
Agree. Not sure why you are being downvoted.
Please show me where you provided any evidence to back up your claim?
Yeah, my partner is a starfish. Thanks, i needed that precise clarification. Dead whale sex too. 
It got completely banned I think, saw a post about it a while back in r/gore.
Seems like the driver in the video car had plenty of time to react and slow down, they just chose not to and overreacted. 
Lots of vested interests coming up with money as well as type investor donations.
I don't see the weirdness there. Also, yes, him then and now could spit in my mouth and I'd be perfectly ok with it.
The 205 guys didn‚Äôt come to play, they came to slay!
Oh heck oh frick
So much time saved. Not.
Less is definitely more. That picture is just kind of forgettable old meme material. This post feels like old keyword stuffing.
Why is he doing this now?
Sad. My condolences to her family.
This sub absolutely gets personal within seconds of anything he says being postes
Is this our year ????
I‚Äôm scared for y‚Äôall saying Undone.
Could be other things. Make sure you have your thyroid function checked. Get a general medical checkup and have all important blood work numbers checked.
Is it allowed be recast in other languages (like spanish)?
Didn't he steal something ludicrous like a diamond ring? Like is he a cartoon bad guy?
Yeeeaaaah, move out and keep showing off the clam.
I ... I like you
i like memes, I just don't like following rules for making memes.
I‚Äôd have rated 4.5
Your dog provided you undeniable evidence of type of person that you are, and you should be proud of that.
That was brilliant üòÇ
Two goals that are directly the fault of the our defense? I feel bad for [NAME]
My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
Great, petty revenge instead of making your GF happy by removing [NAME] from her life, nice job!
Just found out. Thanks for the tip.
She should try that w a fresh bloody sidewalk needle from San Fran, oh the rush !!! 
Depending on where you live he can be temporarily placed with you or more stable family members until CPS determines that his living situation is either safe or unsafe.
Everyone panics when they are on fire.
Que the motorcyclist getting up and pulling a pistol out on the driver for ‚Äúendangering‚Äù his life...
I thought they still had a chance until Cam Chancellor absolutely crushed [NAME]... All confidence was zapped
The women-are-wonderful effect.
I destroyed about 1/2 of them because black snakes are actually a good thing to have around. I just didn't want too many of them.
Damn, but I‚Äôd miss my mother. Then again she‚Äôd be all happy in her heaven. The rest of us can party. 
Because they were monitoring his performance for months now and decided to possibly can him now.
Thank you. Yeah it's a nice thought, being sheltered and happy before any worries or drama. It would be nice...
My hoosband loves dee cee and I love San Diego because of the Gorilla enclosure And the Pandas.
Me whenever I wear heels lol I literally look around to make sure no one is watching then proceed to do my penguin like walk üòÇ
But what‚Äôs the point of not having the brakes?
What's your point? All these comments are from people who clearly had not seen it before. Only a couple said they had.
Any chance we could treat the terrorists as terrorists then?
COME TO BUTTHEAD
You're glad Australia was playing politics at a time like this? That's not a vote of confidence in the [NAME].
"My gut feeling ""what's wrong with his eyes?"" on the second date. Should have listened."
"I really love how he just flung out ""dead mum"" on the offhand chance your mum was actually dead. High risk, high reward."
This may look like hyperbole but you would have to be autistic to not pick up on the sarcasm in that post.
r/browns and browns Twitter are ready to boil over. Let's get this thing over with
Kinda both. The show itself is mediocre and has pretty generic jokes in my opinion. But the fans make me dislike it even more.
No Deal has a decent chance of leading to Scotland and NI leaving and thus the end of the United Kingdom
They'd never give her a crown but it would be so good to see her back on my screen.
Thank you. I really appreciate your response
Violating the law has never been a prerequisite for being charged with violating the law.
I put [NAME] on over the holidays...my family hated it. Freaking love his stand up though and he's pretty widely liked. My family is weird.
Where's this snow everyone's talking about? Just looked out the window and there's no snow here.
yea, get back to me when the deal is done. 
Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!
[NAME] would love it if we rolled over into the hypocrisy of pacifism. The only problem I have with punching [NAME] is making sure your aim is correct.
Don't chase after out of position teammates. Your life as a Mercy is more important. Let them fools die and learn their lesson.
Thanks. I was leaning towards the 11:05 tourney at MGM since it's deeper stack and slightly longer blind levels.
Need context on this lol. I'm on a Uber rn to a bar so will be drinking right with you!
im glad that's not what the game is about then
I said I'm full, sir. That means no desert either. No one likes a pushy waiter.
Crash is probably my favorite specialist in this game, you get extra ammo, extra points and occasionally 50hp more from tak-5.
Awesome! Thanks for your reply
Damn this is dope
Grow up mate
[NAME] doesn't want to leave St Louis, his family is there and won't move away.
They didn't actually run any tests to confirm it was even bone, let alone human.
I can‚Äôt call anyone Daddy. Not even my Dad. It just feels weird and creepy and I‚Äôm not 4.
VOLCEL POLICE!
No, this was pretty expected
This comment completly proves the opinion of the OP right lmao. I‚Äôm so sorry America doesn‚Äôt meet your standards oh mighty reddit commentor
Dad doesn't need to be there for 12 months. But way too step up!
Maybe next time... Hold that 40 pt L for now.
A 12 million sub channel has value. Wouldn't be surprised if it's been hollowed out ready to be sold and rebranded.
If you do that there is no incentive to fix whatever budget problem is
"""While we've decided not to hire you for this postion mr. [NAME], we have an opening at the ticket window"""
Great Expectations!
Take the child from them! Wtf? Theyre so dumb. You always secure the kids seat!
I grew up SDA as well. That probably explains my disdain for religion in general.
The only thing that stops a depressed guy with a gun is a physiologist with a gun. << [NAME]
Maybe try to do some little thing you really used to enjoy. Even if it's just for 5 mins it's still a small victory.
Nah it's a sexual disorder due to brain structure not aligning with body structure but continue to be an ignorant transphobe I guess.
That DJ Wilson Pass was a thing of beauty. So unselfish and skillfully done.
Superfluous? No, just give what you said would be necessary in 2006! 
Australia... Nooooooooooo!
[NAME] and [NAME] were better than everyone on that list except for [NAME]. Also [NAME] is a racist.
Imagine being as fragile as that woman.
Ahhh, my birthday month. I must go.. 
Welcome to The World of... Mobile MMOs. Where power can be yours, for a price.
Ace here! I do masturbate and enjoy it, I just feel no sexual attraction or desire to have sex with other people.

This is so cute and wholesome? How is this terrible
a jpg that's a gif, what a time to be alive
dude different folks different strokes. don‚Äôt kill my buzz bro. happy new years!!!
Maybe if [NAME] is still playing
Came here to say exactly this. It's almost the same scene, as if he tried to recreate it
That‚Äôs why I have a separate work number - I can just shut it off.
I wish to join you on the search, as a source of motivation and friendship (sorry if that kinds led you on)
I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.
i bet her breath stinks
[NAME] oh my god
Congrats on the sex!
Fuck you for making me read this.
"I will then be singing ""The hills are alive with the sound of music."""
No one does
[NAME] I hope this permanent.
No I dont think I said that anywhere
Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous.
To be clear meaty means use later active frames of any move Oki: what posibilities are favorable to me frame wise after an attack
Bless you this post made me cry
For the same reason that you desire for people to explain things to you for free: to gain knowledge that benefits society.
Not really someone I despise, but definitely someone I was ashamed of.
Tropical Oasis Liquid Multivitamin. Amazing stuff.
Ugh, this is so beautiful. The richness in those colors. It makes me wanna cry. 
And he will...Hence he shrugs off whatever you said and continues to treat dashers like trash.
No kids? Who cares. Go your separate ways.
Statute of limitations was up by the time I had a backbone
Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good
She better!!! .....nobody else will
Valid. I think we mentioned in the Discord that exact point the other day.
Hahaha well good! Let me know if you have any questions or anything
Imagine being born in 1987 and not having been invited to a party since your friend's birthday party in 1999 though :(
You're never too young to have a Vietnam flashback
I'm sorry for you, but that pic is in the wrong subreddit.
North end pizzeria! Best pizza in town
Hey quick brag, this post was read by [NAME], episode 63! I'm actually really excited, he's one of my favorites.
For fuck sake... just go and remind them it's the quiet train!
I recommend reading it. What an odd duck/rabbit.
The amount of times this happened during the first tides of war event, smh.
Astonishing. I've read about these people but have never met one. I am so relieved for you that she is out of your life.
What do you think is happening in the post? Read it again and describe your feelings

He‚Äôs been a duke homer since the 90s lol at this point In his career we know what we‚Äôre getting with [NAME]
Yes pls my pugnacoins are waiting
I am like the panda one, thanks! I'm also following [NAME] memes and while it def isnt all recovery stuff it's highly relatable 
Ugh. I know that interchange too well. People around here have been driving bonkerballs the last month or so too (more than usual)
Haven't heard that it has to be under the stars (ie at nighttime) specifically. And that one happens to be only a few centuries old.
That‚Äôs pretty amazing. You made me smile for sure today man. Cheers on a talent and a great setup.
Planning to make a comeback soon‚Ñ¢
Thanks for showing me the most degenerate thing I've seen so far in 2019, and that includes a scat subreddit.

I do have EAP and was lucky enough to get 10 sessions using it. I‚Äôll chat with my boss tomorrow about taking time off. Thank you!
Are you saying he screwed it up?
They paid the cost of removing the graffiti vandalism on the wall you mean, right? ...right?
your cat has the cutest face!
Feel your pain.
I would not recommend that, as communication is very important in this game. But whatever floats your boat I guess.
Somebody should make this a smaller video to share it around, this poor kid is going through a lot.
>All men cheat, you might as well get cheated on by a rich man! Kudos on the level of misanthropy. 
Sorry! Yes you are right about the exact name. My brain confused it with the similarity titled cat toy :-p
seems like [NAME] and [NAME] are the ones playing you, [NAME]
[NAME] are a cancer in our society
Or that's just another terrible problem with the template
Good luck verifying them. All of them.
Sounds like my SIL with me/hubby. But she's a bitch and we never liked her anyways, so neither of us really care lol. 
I thought he was trolling oops
This post was xposted somewhere
What's he building in there?
oh my [NAME] is this real
That's not cute
No faith! Shame!
Yeah that last one made me hate her the most for some reason.
Only in portland
didnt he think to check out the back?
ain't that just a beatiful thought
These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
What makes BDS anti-Semitic, as opposed to just anti-Israel? I see the two frequently conflated, which I think is a mistake.
Not in this thread- but I have heard people act like it‚Äôs no big deal... don‚Äôt take reasonable precautions to prevent spreading it
Imagine buying a product, then burning it in protest 
Yes - summer, and I was with my parents who did all the actual work so I just got to relax with the baby! 
Just stop.
Made by [NAME] who also was involved with Sacred Games so I think you'll enjoy it.
I gotta say, some of the things mentioned are pretty fun. I mean, at least when your in your 20s. 
Well at least he wont be hungry ever again
Stop working, it works with the GM corporation, why not the US corporation. 
Private practice cash only in a wealthy suburban area. Just see the worried well and live the dream.
You're right my bad, I am just trying to find out what it is.
Your coaching is terrible.... be ready and see how [NAME] uses [NAME]
That sounds like a reasonable estimation. So what are YOU going to do? Because you can‚Äôt force them to treat you like real people.
Can someone explain to me what's stopping [NAME] from pardoning everything [NAME] even gazes at?
Yes, protecting women from sexual assault is offensive.
Shame. CLG [NAME] could've been a thing.
Unfortunately I don't know how to read hangul. I'm still in the very early stages of planning so still lots of things to look at!
I'm not vegan cause I love animals, I'm vegan cause I hate myself. 
Epic artist moment
Ooh, political posturing! This accomplishes so much!
Fascinating, can you please provide some more detail on the pre-KOOP origins of the phrase friend : )?
Colts fan here. [NAME] seems like a nice enough guy but, holy crap, terrible coach. Buyer beware.
What u doing dame
‚ÄúWhy is there always someone that brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?‚Äù -[NAME]
Maybe that‚Äôs what boogie was trying to say!
They don‚Äôt have that on iOS unfortunately üò≠ but thank you for the suggestion!
I don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt post that hog.
Im a revolver guy so I've always admired the rhino and its low bore axis design. The Rhino and the Kimber k6s are on my list.
It's less about what actually happened. What's done is done. I just want her to know why sexual exclusivity was so important to me
I really hope I don‚Äôt ever experience a mid life crisis at all. But if I do, I at least want to act my age.
Ok man. Glad yo know you are aware of all financial situations.
It still cracks me up when people call me [NAME].
Ok. I got it. But it was a house. Just seemed odd lol
You do realize the documentary is about the policy not being so natural, as you put it
Triggered:: Welp guess it's time for me to re-up lol
Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
They‚Äôre pretty great for a budget airline.
About a 30k vote difference with over 2.5 million votes cast.
Oh nice!
Any man who won‚Äôt fight for his kids isn‚Äôt worth your time.
What...? That‚Äôs some real mental gymnastics to justify him assaulting her
Everyone except [NAME] dying and [NAME] doesn‚Äôt know what happened
Me too, and not just for the eyeball forks. 
Love these guys and love this skit
I don't think this happened at all tbh
It's unrelated to the post yet I'm laughing out loud
The *only* car channel. FTFY!
Relax it's a joke. Everyone does some 90's at the end of their videos. Otherwise people will assume that you aren't sweaty enough.
Mental illness. Operation on 7 people in a manic state . Four of them died. All his money was gone and his rich friends abandoned him.
Maybe it should become a rule. Or a rule someone can't post his own website constantly. ;)
Getting some sick high school nostalgia from this shot. Thanks for that man!
I‚Äôve made snapchats like this for friends
Or, you know, imagine just poking some fun at the endless title speculation threads.
I'm curious to see the difference, but sadly that's not really something you can just ask someone.
Oh, the show that had [NAME]? Yeah screw him.
Clever!!!
Is the use of stone that common for the medical field in the UK?
Kind of astonishing to see AstroKatie is completely unaware of everything unchecked migration has done to Sweden, France, Germany, etc etc etc.
Not related, but now I wonder how Delta would have done on the hair ball challenge
And yet he's still plummeting in popularity, even now. No he aint babe.
We don't deserve you. Thanks for the update. Happy it's being handled! :)
‚ÄúI wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.‚Äù
Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.
Thank you OP, I love you (no homo if you‚Äôre a male).
Not really. It's just that things you would do in Street Fighter to win are monumentally more difficult if you try to do them in MK.
You shouldn't have been leaving anyway, witch. Go write a funding bill. You know... do your job.
Same here! And I go to Century College. Just started second semester. 38 yr old washed up Mover. 4.0 first semester.
Hope to [NAME] i don‚Äôt end up like u
Right? I think [NAME] needs to be careful cause I could def see [NAME] snapping.
Don‚Äôt take this seriously man, I was joking.
Speaker hitting that juul
and...?
Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be.
Thank you for your advice!
"""I have been abusive."" This was before I even realised his narcissistic characteristics. "
What a disgusting person she is
No stairway.. Deniieed.
It's very common. Same with punching and it not hurting someone in your dreams. Practice more.
Damn you, [NAME]. I‚Äôm a woman and yours are bigger than mine. It‚Äôs not fair!
I am just saying in general, in any situation. Work or not. 
Idk man, some people just have wack combinations. I'm a Yankees/Panthers/Jazz fan, it doesn't have to make any sense. 
He‚Äôs a grumpy boyo
I‚Äôm not usually into ASMR, but I‚Äôll look into it! Thank youu
It has to be, or there will be nothing left to save.
I was at this game live, right by the end zone when he ran this glorious run in. It was beautiful.
I once got one missing half a wafer. So delicious.
How are you punishing him for sneaking food? Why isn't that working? What alternatives have you considered to get him under control?
Ha! I actually included that on purpose, was poking fun at me (and the typical MS3) :)
Now all we need is to beat them in the playoffs one last time and win the super bowl THEN I'll be able to be happy
Wow, so that means common tongue isn‚Äôt English!?!

This picture really drives home that the CIS can be super terrifying when they want to.
Those on the right are oddly easy to convert at times. Good luck.
What song is playing? It's so familiar but I can't place my finger on it
This makes me so happy!
You're not wrong. We move better in a chaotic atmosphere rather than a structured one.
omg i cant believe that nifty is still a thing
That's capitalism for you, don't worry though. There's another recession on the way.
They wanted all the shows to be based in New York. Seems like a weird reason but that‚Äôs what [NAME] said
At least vote 3rd party. A vote for DSA signals a voter that could vote [NAME]. Staying home signals voter apathy
Don‚Äôt think there is a single person that thinks he overreacted there
I like him
I understand them.who puts the tp under not over
The jackets that we have so many people wore so they‚Äôre musty as hell

That convention center sized groan right after the reveal.... No one wanted this. I have no idea what they were thinking.
Dont keep your mouth shut.
Bridge trolls people, people trolls back the bridge, not sure what's happening now

[NAME] literally won the game of baseball that night. Like, go home, we're done, he just won baseball forever.

A lot of kids at my school say Homecoming is the best but I would say Spider-Man 2 is.
This! A while back a girl on here said that ‚Äúthe ed is trying to trick you to keep itself alive!‚Äù

How is 5th starter not a question?
Your team lacks ethics.
If it‚Äôs like my store it might change. I have to check my schedule every other day because of changes
he defended [NAME] when [NAME] drugged and butt raped a 13 year old girl
Except they call him. He doesn't go to their campuses and try to pick off the weak.
you're hilarious. Thanks for the entertainment this morning.
Sorry, didn‚Äôt realize I was talking to a fan of the prestigious UCLA Bruins football program.
I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.

Politics are boring. Vote for everyone. -[NAME]
Get a final closure by telling her mom. Your ex might have told her another story about the breakup.
Oligarch-sponsored? [NAME], stop throwing buzz words at ideas you don't agree with. Read a book.
no the first part about UK becoming a failed state. Why do you think a lot of [NAME] would not want this to happen?
Thanks buddy, looks pretty cool.
We've lived together for 4 years. We do everything together.
Right like interacting with each other having a normal evening? Ugh they‚Äôre both so trashy I‚Äôm sorry.
DoorDash can deliver my White Castle's at 3am, that makes me happy
You can. I've used my Kroger-linked phone number while travelling to other states with success.
I am very happy with the changes. And also very pleasantly surprised the dairy industry didn't manage to make them include more dairy.

Wonder how much meth it would cost to get the dentist to give him a new tooth?

I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it.
Takeover was great but the spectacle of the rumble match itself makes it more interesting for me. Same with MITB and elimination chamber.
Don't let loneliness get in the way of growth. Grow my man, grow!
Pretty sure the legislature needs to change laws
Yes it is. But from what I've read it sounds like it was after the testimony and not one of the charges against him.
I will for sure pray for you all.
I assume you mean how men are guilty until proven innocent in rape cases and how many places refuse to accept women can commit rape

Outwardly projecting someone you aren't internally sounds exhausting. Hopefully coming on here will provide some form of relief for you.
I would no longer be antinatalist, but I would still be childfree.
I don‚Äôt like fasting but that‚Äôs not correct lol
This sounds serious. I don't think I have the ability to help ya but you definitely need to talk to someone.
We were rumored to love [NAME] last year, so maybe we are interested in an athletic TE like that.

I'm upset that there's no sexual subtext between [NAME] and [NAME] in the new Super Mario game
Is this season 7? I don't remember it.
Not admitting you like something because some of the fan base sucks is pretty pathetic.
And mine?
More like trash ass link. Wtf is ‚ÄúApple Music‚Äù, probably some shitty limewire ripoff.
Good to know! I should keep a lookout then.
I somehow doubt that.
Poor cat.
Best rapporteur ever? [NAME] and [NAME] from Outkast.
You‚Äôre forgetting the Great Internet Summit of 2015, which decreed that ‚Äúsuccinctly‚Äù now means ‚Äúexplained in a way I can understand‚Äù. 
Wow, the interview with her mom really made that clip.
Now if you can teach her english, the real fun starts.

You're just upset because it accurately highlights the absurdity of the minimum wage.
I am going to be so happy when they finally air that scaly foot Dr Pimple Popper episode because I‚Äôm tired of seeing it every five minutes.
Nah mate i think you have me mixed up with someone else. I am [NAME]. Pleased to meet you.

Lol the actual state of this Nothing wrong with pointing out [NAME] was a cunt snowflake Suppose it makes a change from your usual woman hating posts
Love Myself by [NAME]. It‚Äôs a song about touching yourself. Kids were singing it.
I‚Äôm just trying to get a woman‚Äôs perspective on the situation.
Sure, but I don‚Äôt think those costs outweigh [NAME] getting caught in crossfire on Queen Street.
I bet you're not the only one. That space is kinda safe... go be slightly challenging. ;)
Yes, they do. It‚Äôs illegal to work for the Federal Government for free. Contractors aren‚Äôt Federal Employees. 
Dummy I'm disagreeing with you
Congrats on being clean, and having a great team mate! 
Delete it fat
Unfortunately if they tried to parent they‚Äôd never listen or just hate them and run away. Pointless

The Calgary Herald has extremist on their payroll?
I felt that way last year and then the Patriots let me down, so best to take no chances.
Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
Agree completely with this statement
Then do lemon tek....trip last 3-4 hours but is very potent
Important part of this, surprising it's not there. 
Recognizing that [NAME] had a weakness for her and exploiting it, is part of politics. 
I'm glad he's still watching
Australian here. I hereby agree that this does in fact provoke nightmares.
Don't worry, when you turn 20 you'll look back and cringe, too.

What if a dealer decided to quit the business cold turkey and threw down his bag and left?
Thanks!!
I wouldn't say everyone's fanatical about not paying tax it just sometimes throws you off if you don't remember about it.
This is interesting. You want to share experiences with her but not necessarily have sex with her?

Hm. Your toast and my toast look very difficult in size
Good luck for everyone pronouncing [NAME] name. If he keeps scoring like this, i'll have fun listening some commentators around NHL.
I'd say no, mostly because you don't plan to stay long-term.
Is it manipulation if it is 100% true, 100% genuine, and 100% good advice?

"And those offences are not Criminal Code offences. Criminal Code offences require it be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that an accused actually committed the offence."
It's so sad that people don't vaccinate their children. For every upvote to this post, I'll vaccinate my child in protest.

I drove through there dropping off an uber passenger and I was really amazed by how beautiful it is.
Are you implying that you can't take a joke?
[NAME] was such a nasty POS. In his dirty wifebeaters with his malt liquor. ‚ÄúMen have needs...‚Äù He disgusts me.
So [NAME] thinks the AFLW has been both elevated and shafted by the AFL in terms of promotion?
My movie theater has automatic reclining seats.
Dr now looks so dapper in black.

Glad [NAME] found some love in his life
Stop opening the pictures. Stop giving her the attention. Go no contact and watch her come running back to you.
[NAME] hire a mod and write up some rules! Is this a text based story sub or images or videos or chaos?
I'm assuming she knew that they knew were trying to steal but [NAME]

We are sorry but the sympathy you are looking for is not available in your region.
I legit saw 3 people with that kind of hood on today
hey of course, I‚Äôm glad I could shine some light. Stay strong mate 
Notice how none of them have kids
Okay rude. Leave [NAME] alone and where he is please. I‚Äôve been rooting for this kid since his first match.
Where‚Äôs the bar on this canoe?
I mean he's rockin the hell outta that porn 'stache
By law, China must accept the South China Sea ruling, period. Stop trying to help China weasel out of it. 
I believe they use some tissue from the urethra that creates some small amount of lubrication.

Don't have the light novels. Heard the translation was pretty bad on them but I discovered that Manga earlier today.
This is alternative facts level populism. The man is a liar.
How dare you hate [NAME]
Congratulations! I have 8 months and 23 days! We DO recover & we can do it together! Proud of you :)
They do it way more often than you do and they give even less of a fuck. It's normal.
yes. crossing the border by land or sea into or from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda or the Caribbean. All you need is an enhanced license. 
Ah yes, Plastique Tiaras drag race, thank you so much izzy....noriega <‚Äî That explains alot!
This is how I feel when I use a crosswalk on a busy street
The banana speaks! Do you just type one to three words in your comments or do you get an integer overflow if you go for four?
Strangely enough, the student debt still counts. Yet another sign civilization is doomed. 
Yes thank you
The NEW & IMPROVED Doggy Slinky!!! Everyone loves a Slinky!
As a pale redhead, moving to Australia recently was an incredibly poor choice. 
I appreciate his deadpan humour.
Does this not happen to all people? If not then at least I found out a little more about why this always happens to me.
They barely screen apparently, and it's ok, I know I'm garbage lol
Cheers to you
Taking a float plane is such a amazing experience - highly recommend!
I'm shocked you still have service. Mine doesn't play, they are cold. 
Imagine one day you found a comment that was rated exactly as it should be.
Celes represent well her talent tho
Nice. Me too. I'm 2002. You?
"I think I translates more into ""Waiting to see what kind of Brexit turd-burger Westminster eventually vomits up""."
Interesting ideas and has a strong argument against postmodernism
Cool story bro.
Sodaman going sicko mode
[NAME] bless you. Some of us are barely hanging on...
Hello fellow Cincinnati area store
I did ..
Did you buy a new saddle as well. Also need to go to settings and set as default or make it active.
More like hold my insulin.. jeez.
Done. Thanks!
[NAME] looked like was in a daze for the last 3 mins of the game
Well in that case, i'll agree with you. I guess we can all do without scholars. 
We are up 2-0 and this game is pissing me off so much.
Should start at 1mg and see how you feel
Thanks for posting OP, much love to the [NAME] out there.
Did he beat all the bosses solo? If he did, he's less of a scrub than I am.
[NAME] fits at 3 separate funerals plus almost every very serious uncomfortable conversation I've ever had would indicate you're not alone. [NAME].
How's the pp looking?
That actually sounds like it would help, I‚Äôm glad it worked for you and I hope you eye is ok now üëÅüí™üèª
I'll probably do the same thing next year that I did this year and that was targeting [NAME] pretty late
Since no one posted it yet
Hey! Any chance you still have those templates? I'd love to replace my screens with Chabot and Dutchy, or Tkachuk, or Stoner :)
[NAME]?! Welcome to the show!!!
r/puns might appreciate this. I know I did!
I don't think abortion is murder, but it's factually way less easy to disprove than the earth being flat.
Lions fan.... Thanks for the beer. It's the first thing I've ever won.
Wait, WHAT?!?!
Plus in total I ended up consuming near 1,500mg because I threw up early in the night and tried to redose
I am proud of you random internet stranger, you peopled good today.
The light socket doesn‚Äôt provide any light, so it‚Äôs useless.
What a douche canoe to take advantage of you like that.
Its what keeps me going, I couldn't hurt my friends and family i love them too much
Pretty big signs that something can be pretty fun and effective when you get these same shitty, selfish teammates.
Oh what a feeling, [NAME]!
Take your upvote and go away
You aren‚Äôt mentioning the specific position and the industry. Not even in what country you are located. How can anyone offer advice?
dont get down on yourself, early NC is very daunting. good luck! (im 11 years NC from nmom....life is good!) 
Nice work. I really want the full scene in this format.
We have outlets with timers in every parking spot of all households in Finland.
Is [NAME] somewhere on Apple Music? I can‚Äôt find her
Annnnnnd you get downvoted by people who don‚Äôt like getting downvoted. What a time to be alive.
If your dog is an arctic breed they will go crazy with joy and be sad that you don‚Äôt share in their happiness for the bitter cold.
Okay. The wall that he's mentioning. What wall would that be? ***on the border?? Oh my! Big surprise***
Is this Futurama?
I sincerely apologize...I‚Äôll delete and please take this upvote
Meth and booze.
That was a fun conversation. I've seemed to have broke you into copy pasta.
I am sure the protection was from other males. How does hat change things?
even the safe queen (pearl) was amazing. i would have had pearl and ginger double win
This sucks so much and I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you recover and have a wonderful life.
Can't wait to bring it to 1
I like him in Friends from College too!
Good luck friend.
Omg actually?! I mean no judgment , I am just SHOOK 
You are so stunning! A very classic beauty.
What a nice sub
I really enjoyed it actually. The world and the monster seemed really cool an original idea.
Well, they have a point on the Tories bad thing . . .
I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny
Do you mean addons exclusive to him? The instasaw bubba is pretty fucking good....
That‚Äôs another unfair accusation. I spent a lot of time trying to reach an understanding with you.
Read his post again. 'It's more fact based than Fox.' I'm sorry but you might have some extra chromosomes.
Lol only a snowflake would call that a harassment campaign
Name calling and personal attacks are completely unacceptable on this sub. Consider this a warning.
Don‚Äôt waste money on guns, you‚Äôll be given all the best guns in the story
The part where he carries her to the car had me howling! Poor guy was stumbling with the weight he obviously couldn‚Äôt handle
Can't relate because the sadness and loneliness is constant üòé
Now you see me.... Too. Lol
Oh my [NAME] your desk is fucked.
Wishing the best for your pupper.
If your significant other had sex with someone after getting drunk, you wouldn't consider that cheating?
Hell of a pass!
The same here. It's hard to be alone, but not as hard as the eggshells and abuse.
Why can't I get Hulu in Canada yet!! So annoying
Because majority of moves have stupidly long names. GO INTO ANGEL PUNISHER INTO DIVE BOMB RADIANCE AND FINISH THE JOB WITH PUNISHING LIGHT BLADE
FIRE THE MEDICAL TEAM.
I thought the exact same thing. Especially since he kept saying he hadn't done anything wrong. He totally smoked crack with her.
üëç <3<3 so much yes! üî•
Sorry I should have been more specific! A spiral chemical perm (I love curly hair!)
Wow! Dude has aged well. Maybe I need some of that snek oil!
A Pulitzer Prize winning journalist wrote the piece. It is still not clear exactly what was ‚Äúinaccurate‚Äù in the article.
At least she can eat Abel or something so we don't have to worry about feeding her.
Your friend should be disowned by their family
DDR is enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, thanks to DDR A. Hopefully this will lead Konami to considering a new home release.
Only time I wake up in jeans is after a few too many jack & cokes.
Was anyone on just now, and got booted from the server? It now looks like both servers are down, both are 9999 ping for me.
Something tells me no!! Lol.
It‚Äôs a joke.
And of course, the non working class, for whom tax rises or cuts are an irrelevance, skew Labour. 
Eat the stump
Holy shit this golden comment flew under the radar. I laughed so hard
But realistically if you‚Äôre expecting fine dining at any airport you‚Äôre probably kidding yourself. Sustenance without food poisoning is about the best you can hope for.
Until they find out oh she went underground üôÑ
No spelling and grammar errors. Oh my [NAME] better than the other repost.
I like that!
Alright, thanks again
Never surrender mate
"Sure does bud. You now belong in a racialized group. Your membership to the ""historically oppressed minority club"" is in the mail."
That guy with the orange jacket looks so distraught. Feels bad man.
Looks like you're about to hit that Fortnite default dance
Before we continue, I would first like to ask you what you believe net neutrality to be so that I know we're both operating under similar definitions.
Looking forward to seeing [NAME] back on his nest
They can be upset about both. Believe me, I've heard the lecture about how Catholicism is a cult and the abortion tirade in the same sitting.
This will be me a year from now. Not fair at all.
Yeah its that Scream guy you always see in that painting. He also played bass for [NAME].
The double fist bump made me smile, her happiness was contagious
What exactly do you personally think that meme is saying, please point back to the meme for each argument you make. 
My mom wrote a paper for me once in 5th grade. I got a B-. Needless to say, I learned my lesson.
yea I was gonna say that looks pretty good to me
Makes sense, I don‚Äôt think I called out to them ever. Thanks. 
Don‚Äôt say his name!!
I got cousins who were missionaries to Venezuela in the [NAME] years. They have not been shy about their opinions on this matter. They support the rebels.
no problem!!! :) have a great day, thanks for taking the time to comment
Sadly enough I was thinking the same.
You‚Äôre heartless if you‚Äôre calling people who smoke marijuana ‚Äúdruggies‚Äù and I‚Äôm done arguing with you, have a nice day.
That‚Äôs my point.
another day, another ‚Äúmets interested in player who will take away [NAME] playing time!!‚Äù 
That was.. very confusing and entirely unhelpful? I read it three times and got nothing from this.
Nothing is off the table when you‚Äôre morally right and the ends justify the means
I love your username
Yes, things. 
Why would we put a center at SF
If only he could‚Äôve known that [NAME] made it out safe and got to live honestly for a little while
There is no assuming the worst. Its experience and taking things at face value.
no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.
Lol I‚Äôll wait for nothing to come of this.
Agree with you there, no one has a strong enough argument as for why it shouldn't be legalised
Op is likely young and clueless. There‚Äôs likely a reason they‚Äôre in retail.
I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn‚Äôt think of anything I broke at my last retail job but... you‚Äôre right, that was it
And it will absolutely be brigaded by gun but subs
That‚Äôs petty debateable, there‚Äôs disagreement in the ranks but not enough to change their names or policies. 
I like surprises.
i am ive done him 3 times now and i have found multiple people who have the bug.
Also, keep an eye out for women who just want to use you for free drinks!
Thanks, that was a big help. This one had me scratching my head 
Desperation doesn't think.
[NAME] looks like she is satisfied with the lesson she taught her son
 No mention of [NAME]? For shame, subreddit. For shame. 
I'd be careful with that, could be construed as cybersquatting which is illegal.
This really circled my jerk
Whoever this is, feel free to PM me if you want to chat!
Shitty cars made of plastic
So, a kid?
Probably cause our FBs are not strong enough defensively so we need a way to justify playing them
It's a trendy thing to do.
...to win the popular vote, which she easily did.
One of he most useful things I‚Äôve read on this site as a medical student. Thank you very much.
The rest of the country is getting dicked by the cold weather meanwhile Phoenix had a low of 54 only.
You know it! Just gotta find the right someone.
Too late, you read it anyways. Ban me if you don't want to read more. Lmao!! 
What makes it even more bizarre is that she does hair for a living. (At least she did during the filming of the doc about her.)
iirc they were changing a few servers names, tht might have caused a few issues
yah [NAME] is well-known knock out artist. What's your favorite KO/TKO of his in the UFC? Oh wait....
I mean the ST coach market seems a little dry. Maybe this is best we could do this year.
Nah, I knock on the door from inside, or the wall, or tap the floor, seems easier
"Except for all those companies brushed off in the ""and many more"" category. Wasn't as lucrative for them. "
That's why the link points directly to that time stamp.
I thought that already happened when [NAME] was confirmed. I was told that would be the end of America!
As far as I can tell, but her religion does seem to influence her practice 
She threatened to hurt you, I would file a police report.
and there goes any hope.
That‚Äôs crazy! I‚Äôve watched every season 6 times now and I‚Äôm just realizing that they are in an office!
How offensive. I, am NOT a duck!
>Shouldn‚Äôt the Bible be infallible No. That would be idolatry. Only [NAME] is infallible,
$1200 gets you a hell of a nice mortgage on a home.
Cool! Tell me more about yourself---PM me if you're more comfortable.
I'm still worried about [NAME] though :(
Yeah I love can ox, but they should stay in small indoor venues or something. Their music is better for that anyway. Cold vein is classic
great!! thank you
Only 27? Lol
Oooh is this about [NAME]? Edit: Yup! Sure is!
Witness me, I will ride historic, dusty and lacquered, on the country road
Ouch, my heart. I never even thought about this...
Looked like it hurt
Your belief is literally killing children
I want to wipe her entire face off the face of earth
I feel so much safer when my doctors are only abusing prescription medication... /s
He means they may be down atm
Just cancer. You‚Äôre good.
"I think people feel the need to ""catch up"" to guildmates so they can do end game content together"
Socio emotional anus! What vision
This made me laugh.
I love [NAME] already
Yes please go get tested even if you don‚Äôt have any symptoms.
No lights are a problem for the people in front of you. Not the offender.
At LEAST one. It could be up to 3 additional victims who were uninformed that they had a biological son.
Literally. > i also dont know if i should post that here Because it's wrong? Nah, you're in the right place.
My guys about to laser a 5 year old cause he didn‚Äôt give that little girl his lunchable
Holy cow. The elephant looks like it just nudged her......and she went flying into next year.
You're not alone
bravo.. my friend.. bravo.. that was great!! I've never seen that before. That made my day.
Wait for real? That's how they met? lol that's both terrifying and completely fitting considering how nuts they both are
This is a person who has clearly danced a lot, I wonder what happened 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL
Can‚Äôt relate
He looks so young without a beard/moustache though.
At least her granddaughter will grow up to know her worth. *Oh wait.*
That's so horrible. I am so sorry that you had to endure that abuse. I hope that you have a bed that you love now.
They are both good in their own way. But the us is funnier lol
This is so sad. #playdespacito
[NAME] won it last year, even with all our goal kickers. Didn't think it would happen again with our set up.
Yes he is a hard worker for sure. Just wish he could get his shot back on track.
you have twice the courage I wish I had. well done dude!! wishing you all the best!
Shabbat Shalom! Thank you for sharing, I really like your videos, keep up the good work!
It's super annoying. There is a reason I no longer speak to this person.
"Need age to help, as ""pretty sure shes interested"" normally means shes either being nice OR just likes the attention abit while at work."
I‚Äôm surprised they arnt argonians
I wanted to be a forensic scientist towards the end of primary school but high school science ruined it for me too.
Their orange chicken is the absolute fucking bomb. I love having it on top of a nice bed of rice and veggies :D
No. Being a private investigator isn't illegal.
Apparently government cares about the environment about as much as many of our neighbors.
Getting dropped by [NAME] did a number on himü§£
I don't care about him at all. üò§üò§üò§
Ah yes, consent is when they awkwardly laugh off an unsolicited sexual encounter!
right and hope you don't realize until too late that you're way better than me
It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
He's not putting you first though, is he? It's his family first. That needs to be addressed.
Incels dont get laid regardless of age limits. Sorry dude
bored waiting for the game [NAME]
I'm in disbelief people think women can't be FA.
actually OP‚Äôs account
Glad I could help!
I feel like this doesn't mean much,
I like you
After you, Mr. international street-shitter. 
"like i said in other thread ""ppl really overrate young, rookie contract, potential, and timeline"". smh."
‚ÄúPeople said I was stupid for stretching out my lobe so far that it ripped. Well who‚Äôs stupid NOW?‚Äù
Weird how analgesic is the opposite of what I might‚Äôve guessed it to mean
I‚Äôm surprised that any of this is considered that big of a deal. At least he wasn‚Äôt molesting little kids.
Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck
I lost it at the 5th panel.
OMG I looked at this they're coming I can hear the boots.
Why are you taking a picture of a playground? Lol
He's rooting for the losing team and is pissed.
Yet another clown whining about discussions about bitcoin in a bitcoin sub.
Illegal workers have no rights, no recourse to the law in the face of mistreatment. Abusive employers like that.
oh got itüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Bless his heart
So I did. Good call.
The only rank that can't be deranked is diamond. However, all rewards are based on peak elo. So don't be afraid to keep playing.
How does he wake up with hair like that?
[NAME] bless you, massive truck driver. Stay safe.
Was not expecting that to be a real sub.
I do this. It's pocket cash though. You have to do a whole lot of walking if you want to hit 6k.
Very good (and depressing) point haha
It's catdog's parents
I‚Äôve never heard of this before. That‚Äôs awful.
I take it they want to have sex with üêás.
Funny coming from the party that is #1 in killing babies.
There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
I fucking love this
I wanted a friend. I guess that's too much to ask.
Game of the conference season so far and ESPN screws up the stream with only a link to the game in Spanish?
And they lived happily ever after.
You are too nice. That guys angry he loses to wardens all the time.
> Mother wasn't amused and I was forced to smile and bare it Wow, I would hate taking nude family portraits
Dam boys, we announcing players back in training like new signings! 
There is a difference between attacking someone, because they say they don't like someone else and attacking someone, because they kill people.
Thank you. Language is weird. Why do you have multiple words for the same thing?
You can't rightfully earn a billion dollars. Your employees can, and fifty thousand people in sweatshops can, but a single person cant
Because people that comment on YouTube videos are toxic, filthy heathens.
ya primetime game, huge comeback and hardens sheer dominance pulling that team was amazing to watch
you just use the word weird like that's all there is to it. weird isn't the issue. the issue is garbage
Shotgun rack? LOL. I had a BB gun rack on my Schwinn in the 60s in Houston.
It's actually pretty cool in here today, not hot at all
My stress levels are really too high. Let Tuesday bring some good news...
Maybe with spelling, but his dad watches SNL every week I betcha.
same- just about to recommend this book. it's a fantastic review of rheum disease states, diagnoses, treatments, etc.
I don‚Äôt think so honestly. He‚Äôs said I‚Äôm cute before last night. It wasn‚Äôt the first time.
I‚Äôll be honest I really don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm happy to know that others care about this, but eh you do you
Seems like an odd hypothetical question to ask.
Except for the part where it grows in with that awful shape people make because they can only see themselves in the mirror.
I would applaud, but a polite golf clap seems more appropriate. Well done. üëè üëè 
I always felt [NAME] was just a bit too slick. I never trusted him even before the scandal came out.
What‚Äôs that extra B for?
And if you love that, check out Angie Tribeca.
As a white man on the internet I'm outraged... because I had to laugh and laughing hurts right now : (
Lol ratheists suck fedoras!
I wish my mom was catgirl savvy.
This should be everyone's wish.
Papaoutai still leaves me bald.
Eventually sure. But the question really lacked the maybe later option lol
The real comedycemetery is people still posting this joke for the hundredth time
Seeing him give the stone was the only one left in the entire universe, that‚Äôs like having a problem (which is really distribution).
yes, agreed. 
I have found that sometimes you can redirect their tantrums by asking them where their nose is.
Oh i had it where whoever you didnt pick becomes the mastermind
He only accepted [NAME] challenges because he never beat him decisively. [NAME] on the other hand...
I wanna say they beat the Rams twice that year.
What do you expect? They used WordPress to create the entire thing. I wish this was a joke but you can check for yourself.
"> ""But I'm their father. They have to,"" he kept saying. And there is delusion colliding with reality."
Alright cool thanks for the tip - I'll give it a try!
He knows she's winning the PR war, so he's lashing out like the angry toddler he is.
Really love these concepts. Fantastic work. Love the work in the comments especially the green with the M.
Consider this a digital hug. Not too long, not too short, just enough to make you feel a human connection and some comfort. :)
IIRC those who made those statements while it occurred were lambasted as conspiracy theorists by the conforming majority. Life is full of surprise.
How is this cable beneficial to Belgium? Who agreed to this?
The Mavs would probably have to give up some picks as well
Well I‚Äôm hyped.
Yeh 300+ years ago. Now they get paid pretty much to go to college. Nobody alive today even had great grandparents involved.
Refreshingly low upvote/downvote ratio.
[NAME] looked just as bad as [NAME].
internally down-voting for the sarcasm!
Does death count as a home remedy?
Listen to yourself. What other things do u want to shove down the throats of others in the name of tolerance and humanity? [NAME].
They are always a fun time.
IMAGINE TRYING TO MAKE ACADEMIES VIABLE WITH NO DOMESTIC TRANSFER MARKET LOL
I wish they would just let us stream their music. I have all their albums but every iPhone I get I have to redo the entire library üò¥üò¥
Well, exactly that actually, lol. 
He has a prog rock album.. its horrific
FOR THE PEOPLE
I appreciate everyone on this sub
Shotgun Stories (2007) doesn't have the bank robbery hook, but is about two families feuding in rural Arkansas. [NAME] is great in it.
No way. [NAME] was annoying. Arizona left a huge gap in the cast, she was great 
Like looking in a mirror. I feel you man, I feel you.
I love this. BFFs don‚Äôt get enough love on these subs, but they make everything better. :)
I used to use Phillips but I switched to State Farm this year
I knew nothing about the cult, and it is one of my 2 or 3 favorite Netflix originals. 
Love reading these kind of posts! So happy for you.
I have this in my waiting list, I can't wait to see it. 
That's just a bad close-out, gotta know [NAME] is bating for those.
I thought he was asked about it during an interview and that‚Äôs why he brought up
When I harass women with innuendo and they politely deflect, they know I am right. At least that's what I told the judge. 
Oh so you're being a troll, good to know.. I actually thought for a second that disgusting, freak couples like y'all actually existed
Does it have less scope glint than the 3x medium range scope? Or any glint at all?
That's not what he meant. He means the use of a lot of different hashtags.
Omg. This is the real gem in this post. Thank you sir
Anyway, it's 00:33 am here at the moment, so I'm gonna head to bed. Thank you for reading and good night :)
I just googled the thing. Yeah thats it! I might have described it incorrectly but that looks very similar. Thanks!
Believe it or not, but I saw that he's a college instructor now
We do what we must
I like how people are downvoting when this is how so many military coups have happened. I challenge those who downvote to prove me wrong
It's the best, I haven't been so happy in a long time!
I'd actually really like to see the numbers.
I wouldn‚Äôt be mad. We need someone who knows what the hell theyre doing
>She was very normal LMAO This got me
This is so uncharacteristic of him /s
Oh no, [NAME] is in pain
Even a powerline adapter won't save you from the laggy mess that is SFV
Do I need a reason other than: he hands out $100.00 bills to would-be voters?
This shit had me howling, which I can't say happens too often. Didn't expect to see comedic gold in that sub.
I meant from when I was a kid and teen. Sorry.
I have an 88% wr rn as [NAME].
Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on. 
She's so cute! Give her all the huggles
Don't forget fluent in sarcasm
Thanks for yelling it
From my experience, doctors are generally understanding and they study psychological issues as part of their education. Be honest if they make a wrong assumption, though.
OMG she reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! I'm in love!
Sure hope #4 includes subsidized housing. I'm terrified.
It‚Äôs funny because this is the summary of most discussion posts on this sub
Ah thanks for the tip.
Fuck I‚Äôm sitting in position 3 right now
"And its those same strong young rakes that add the finishing touch to ""ÊÉÖ"" Choco Pies, among the heartiest snack foods in the world."
Youre gonna be really disappointed when you hear [NAME] track with the guy from Degrassi
I'm literally screaming.
That is really awesome you found something like that for him. Have a great time.
Wow that‚Äôs scary, she‚Äôs so young and healthy. I hate that. 
Oh my [NAME] stop
It will work this time!
"The ""extinction events"" is lame because Earth right after that extinction event will be a Haven compared with the Hell Mars is."
As someone who has been in a similar relationship, it is indeed emotional abuse.
I remember being a kid and everything I did was haraam like even looking at people was haraam :/
So much tininess!
Well, when you look back in the history many hypes say a lot about humanity in general. That doesn't mean every person enjoyed the thing.
Trade up for Haskins. If that doesn't happen give me Greedy.
It blows my mind that there are still people out there that think pot is more dangerous than alcohol.
I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would? 
No! Mom said it was MY turn!!!!
That's why I don't open Instagram that much
It's my birthday today, so thank you, I guess? I hope something nice happens to you too.
Ahhh, the ol' Samsung Special. 
Lol i love my life. You're the one insulting random strangers on the internet. Must suck having no life üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
My favourite book, the writing is beautiful. Very much a precursor to 1984.
Yes I was feeling bad that hes friends left him
Ok, hope you are right
Just traded [NAME] and [NAME] for [NAME] in dynasty. Go to SF
I doubt that [NAME] cares.
regret unfollowing him...
Fair enough.
The new stylish stadiums will look outdated in 15+ years. Standard stadiums will still look the same
Very irony based.
Also feeling very inspired....i will definitely try doing the same thing
It's a minor part of the article. Trust me, there's actually a LOT of information that isn't olicity-related here.
Normally yes, but then it would be an attractive woman (at least it used to be).
Just so freaking miserable. Trying to make me miserable as well
So he watches a movie documenting how a band became mainstream and complains about them being mainstream. O-k
as someone who doesn't wear a kippa at work out of concern for these things happening....what was being said? And thank you for standing up.
As always I leave reddit slightly more confused than when I came here
Something would go terribly wrong for [NAME] causing him to have to leave. It‚Äôs how his ability works.
Yeah, but the thing is that I did send them. Therefore, I don‚Äôt have them, and haven‚Äôt for months.
Ooof. I have a hard time trusting asexuals who declare this information mid elationship.
I recomend a Jasikevicius from Litva :) Sorry for English.
I‚Äôm scared of shots, but I‚Äôm more scared of dying. What Anti-vaxxers are scared of is autism
FYI your boyfriends fucking her too.
I believe if he did (and she didn‚Äôt) then he SHOULD be in even more trouble. They can easily fact check that.
Once I saw the LV logo I then realized I‚Äôm not rich enough to even watch that video.
Grew up in the south. When I left for college, I was very confused why people were walking around with smudges on their foreheads for Ash Wednesday.
I‚Äôm glad not too much time was put into this
Haven‚Äôt forgotten, but let‚Äôs get his ridiculous defense up to par. 
Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Just speak with a Sheffield accent lmao
Sad really. Are they really that threatened by people speaking a language? We all speak English everyday, not like we do for sectarian reasons.
Not having sex doesn't mean you can't talk about it especially if the ultimate goal is proper coexistence.
They're doing a good job dividing people. I see many poor people vote for the rich.

His sister likes his Cox
We'll worry about it tomorrow
That's no excuse.

How old are you? It sounds like 90% of the guys you know who are your age also don‚Äôt have their shit together
Annoyed by the people refusing**
True, but it'll happen sooner than a constitutional amendment will.
Because our roster has gotten worse each year since 2017 and the team is spending less. That isn't a recipe for continued success
I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
... I don't feel like your comment is from an objective point of view... Thanks though.
I wish I'd get invited to parties...
interesting theory. I'll try to keep this in mind more. ‚ô•
You forgot the /s friend.
[NAME] just has to wait a few hundred years
I just looked that up... Dear [NAME] why?

That is not a law. It's a freaking poem that someone decided to write.
The positive side to this is i get to relive the same emotions that I felt losing my virginity....ever few months.
I'm 33 and every year I'm more sure I never want children. I am perfectly happy with my husband and our cats. ‚ù§Ô∏è
No I‚Äôm not

Hmm. I don't disagree. It's unfortunate.
Yes!!!! My fam says Amein now.

They're off thinking about ways they can avoid topics and deflect more, since they seem so good at that lately.
This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
This is a test, now YOU have to give away that gold. Your donor was a cruel benefactor. 
Was getting ready to comment about this one. Was really surprised how much I liked it but can see why it‚Äôs not for everyone
This right here is the kind of father I want to be. Thanks for that.
Says nothing about a 2nd interview
[NAME] with that birthday gift
Horseshoe effect going on with FBPE and the no deal brexiteers, basically if you're soft remainer or brexiteers they hate you. The irony ha

It is a highly underappreciated movie...FOOLS
thank you! This is what I thought she said as well
My feelings exactly. First thought, a sarcastic 'Thanks.'
I love the twist you did on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs all gravy‚Äù idiom. Definitely saving this comment to refer back to when I need life advice
Virtue signaling and gate keeping is left praxis. Dont forget shitty gritty memes. policing eachother keeps us busy enough! And the establishment prefers it that way
[NAME] be exploding
Don't worry we'll just whip up a quick song!
That works both ways tbh. You resent them for making you do it, they resent you for doing it.
you are correcting and downvoting me after I've already corrected myself, btw.
Because it's the one right that we hope to never need, at least in the sense of revolt or self defense.
Thanks for the heads up! I‚Äôve been wanting to see this for a while.
Reject your humanity voluntarily and put the pure hatred, lack of moral, sociopathy and sadistic altitude inside of your soul with no way to turn back.
üòÇüòÇ she really is. I can‚Äôt stop laughing. She‚Äôs a fruit loop!
I have a headache from watching that
Why would you need to take his phone or car? He can get a job or move out.
It was more of a joke. I still have hope for [NAME]. Just kind of a tough sell at this point.
She doesnt mind! I'm her favorite person!
Looks like the walk of shame. Heading home after a night of partying and to much drinking.
Neat what she did. Tricked the trickster!
OK, I better understand the distinction you're making. Thanks.
Just got back from Orlando to Chicago yesterday. I have a good feeling about this one!
As long as the stop watch on my iPhone is timing him, my kid will do almost any chore. Its crazy what kids find exciting
Frack 'em, frack those oily fracks.

If you're more concerned about a potential person than an actual person, you should get out of medicine. You aren't qualified.
Its a tough thing, but our government NEEDS to be downsized drastically. I just hope the affected employees have help with the transition.

Is that his thing? (I honestly don't know what his thing is)
You commie bastard
The men that you grew up around sound pretty insensitive. I hope that they didn‚Äôt cloud your opinion of what a typical man is like.
I wasn't sure either. I'm 30 and my doctor has never said anything about getting retested or revaccinated.
Downvoting because of a lack of funny, regardless of your clumsy attempt to insinuate that my doing so means I'm thin skinned.
What you are describing is what I am feeling right now aswell. It's hard to handle the fact but atleast you aren't alone.
Sure let's leave a bomb outside a [RELIGION] secondary school, that'll show the [NAME]!
I‚Äôm sorry about your friend.
If the goal of this show is to consistently find people with horribly annoying voices, I have to say the producers are spot on. 
Reddit university man. A hard and rocky road but it takes you places.
Unemployment was also significantly higher at the end of Old Labours tenure than at the beginning. Yet nobody remembers that.

"How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
Love this! Love you! Thanks for sharing!
good to see your story had a happy ending!
What happened in his personal life? I know he had a bunch of head injuries; is there more than that?

Hey if any are left, I'd like to happily donate!
Exactly, you never know. Good luck for Monday!
You say 'A single MP' as if it's not that big of a deal. In my humble opinion, that's still probably one too many...
Perhaps they did and downvoted the quality of the article. Maybe you're just trying to insert your own bias here?
"""Time heals all wounds. Give time time."" Best of luck to you."
Oh wow, that was a serendipitous ending! The weed saved her life. 
OK name it. It will help. As for as merc is concerned, no worries reached tier one already

[NAME] fucked up with this line up. Why do you change it, if everything was going good? Idiot! 
She talks about him getting some manners... She's the only without manners... and she should've gotten kicked off...
She's married and I respect her family and husband too much.
Idk it‚Äôs your choice
You look like [NAME] ex fianc√© from The Office

[NAME] is talking about another human in this world getting horny in an fashion he does not approve of.
Those turkey legs look delicious
Once it became clear I was too old to have a family, yeah, it felt too old to bother with it.
I can play faster. I just don't enjoy it as much. Might I ask what is your draft winrate?
I appreciate [NAME] diving for that, but because he did, it lead to wide open Korver transition 3. About as automatic as it gets
Wrong. Dopamine is addictive, seratonin is well being.

Ignorance is strength.
Mostly because they're not completely stupid. They don't have the support in the senate to pull it off.
Probably a disclaimer so if they're 2mm short and your cut doesn't work, they can just point at the sign and refuse a refund/return/exchange.
There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for.
Exactly! It amazes me how many people dont communicate with each other. Talk about it, see what they say. Discuss. Come to a conclusion.
Polarizing filter needed??
All this, for *one* kid? How fucking selfish.
This could be an amazing metaphor for super smart AI‚Äôs. We‚Äôre the egg.
This is almost a r/ATBGE situation
She knew the magic words. Luckily it doesn't seem like anyone else was harmed.
There are other petty crimes that can be more heavily prosecuted, like unpaid child support. 
But there's supposed to be only one survivor, and they win the million dollar prize!
Why slum it if they‚Äôre giving you actual cost?
Because it contains the nudity of a child, and that is a federal crime?
Not a particularly in-depth article, but I thought it was a worthwhile follow-up to the recent post about police ticketing people outside Tim Hortons.
Maybe trust biology and basic science instead of some dumbass who is just writing about gender cuz its 2018 and people are morons
That sounds frustrating!
Reminds me of the dude who was hit on the back/side by a RC helicopter.
If [NAME] is being considered for all defense, [NAME] needs more love too
Unblockable feint dodge light beats a roll on reaction to the unblockable.

It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
I remember all the Bolt-on jokes this sub was making when it happened. All the best [NAME]
This just made me laugh loudly in public causing uncomfortable stares.
Well I am a lady, so that would probably just freak them out. Oh, Reddit. Everyone is a man haha.

You make less than zero sense.
[NAME] looks like he is about to commit >!1-2!<
Meh good introduction. Sadly I am a pro philosopher so know all of this
It's perfectly fine
It's hard to say. They are an above average team that often looks lifeless and underachieves.

Omg this is too good.
Usually they dont even show up when you call them and they are a rare sight in the city. Good luck finding one.
Nah dude, it's religious.

"Who the fuck reads news *papers* anymore? Baby boomers. This kind of crap is totally written by a ""journalist"" in need of a safe place."
If it's all for [NAME] I'll forgive it.
Fun fact. If you combined North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana into one state it would have roughly the same population as Puerto Rico!
If those people abandoned you for sharing how you feel then they are not your friends
This time next year, this game will be praised. The current installation will be ridiculed in its place. Its been this way for years 
*Noveau riche* effect. American tourists were similarly perceived as 'the rudest' in the mid-century.
So kinda like an assistant? Interesting
I still don‚Äôt understand what did [NAME] do? Lol

I always do this. They get closer or just move to another lane lol
I understand. Thank you for the suggestion.
They‚Äôre disgusting people inside and out
I like her too! I hope she does well and stays away from [NAME].
Yet, the Blue Bell crowd still worships this half ass ice cream, full of artificial flavors and HFCS.
My goal for the year is to delve deeper into GTO related play and how to better understand how to use that to play better myself and against others
This joke made me want to walk right out of the Dumbledoor.
My vanity point for my love for SS is that it has a lance lord.
Good thing you listened to your gut, ran, and made a lot of noise! Yikes! Glad you're ok.
Its definitely [NAME] fault for leaning into it though. Nobody‚Äôs pressuring her to have ‚ÄúActivist‚Äù in her Twitter bio.
#cooking #uni #urchin #local #tidetotable #truecooks #seafood #cheflife
And you better fucking get there early too! Bargain shoppers don't fuck around.

Insofar as the Church has definitively ruled, it has been against evolution.
[NAME] is a sensitive topic for me, so when she is brought up, sometimes I just go on a little tangent. My apologies. 
Happy late birthday :) I hope you got to spend it with someone/doing something that makes you feel happy and whole.
That sounds pretty good
No longer want to what?
Me too. I didn't want to promote anybody here but there are way cheaper alternatives with shipping benefits... If you know what I mean.
And it seems, just genuinely nice, hilarious, and passionate about her work. I hope she gets more of an edit from now on!
i should just quit yikes
Excellent idea, thank you!
And its not me
Last year was also the first time we drafted a lineman before round three since [NAME], so I think the earlier look at linemen was needed haha
Congrats on coming out
Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.

All the best to you in 2019! I hope whatever lies next for you is rewarding. :)
My knees shattered and my collarbone broke just reading this
No problem. Didn't mean to nitpick. Good luck with the exam!
That kid has the face of a douchebag
I doubt [NAME] could do make up as well as a drag queen. He's not really good at anything.
I‚Äôm jealous.
I wasn‚Äôt considering potatoes in the discussion or else it‚Äôs a clear number 1. Are potatoes vegetables?
[NAME] man...try passing it to the place where you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be
How am I arguing? I thought it was pretty clear I'm asking how something works in what I presume is a different county.
Yea ok.
Do you have anything special you say to yourself to help facilitate that? I think I might need a snappy mantra to remind myself to chill out.
OH [NAME] THAT'S TERRIFYING SOMEBODY SAVE US ^/s
oh no I agree that its edited, but I think she has other things going on too.. BDD at least 
No just take care of your body!!! Fuck that
[NAME] is ruining the Pittsburgh Steelers culture...don't fucking @ me. Sinking fucking ship
What the fuck did I just read?
The trailer or the movie?
while i'm grinding my pitchfork tines... can i get a source on that?
You poor thing. I‚Äôm sorry that it‚Äôs going like that for you.
I trust Safeway over Great Canadian Superstore for my meats. I know I'm not alone in that regard. Safeway has some pretty good cheaper meats.

>very creepy horror-themed Very accurate description and only from a few second piece of an audio recording
I feel like itll be less like we imagine but similar to the magabomber. Just some crazy dude living in his van
well, most of them won't even get that far because the second you start explaining it they plug their ears and start screaming about socialism.
This... This is where my journey ends. I was not able to make it to the end, good luck future redditors! 
It seemed weird to me as well. It's just 10mcg of cyanocobalamin with some fillers like corn starch and celulose.
People want quick fixes. Going to the root takes time and effort
They‚Äôve always been bad my guy
Hey man its been 50 days since you have posted so im just here making sure you alright
"I'm missing the ""funny"" part. This is just someone killing himself."
Enough in every catagory to be both respected by my peers and have respect for myself.
Lol don't worry, they even make you somehow hate [NAME] in season 2.
Thanks [NAME], I could unclench two minutes earlier.
He ships.
Oh yeah...family chantel!
YPG has carried out numerous attacks. Yet you seem to judge them on the few messed up things they have done.
Those refs were terrible, god damn. GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests.
Misandry is not part of our feminism here. Don‚Äôt make such comments again.
the older me would be scared shirtless knowing all the fireworks that exploded nearly in my hand as a kid
That's the idea, don't be so indignant that I called out your bs.
I will bet you $1000 this drags on until 2020 because [NAME] is 100% the naked partisan hack he is purported to be.
How original, another ‚Äú[NAME] hates tutorials‚Äù meme...
Browns offense has been rough but hes keeping the ball moving.
It‚Äôs beautiful hun
Outrage over something that isnt even true. Thats sad man Edit: well the bandwaggoning part is true
> [NAME] is a religion, not a race. In the Holocaust, did the NAZI's commit genocide against a religion? or a race of people? 
Yeah, my thoughts exactly. Alright people, time to revive this comrade's karma.
There isn't. It's a brigaded thread. Good opportunity to tag accounts, though.
Nice one comrade
And he'll still be unimaginably rich after the fact, so this has gone so far into edge-case territory where the unfairness doesn't really matter
This is my favorite meme that happened every year
[NAME], just keep doing exactly what you‚Äôre doing. I LOVE YOU SO MAAAACH.
Give her weed to make her asexual and want to have sex with you. Great [NAME] logic.
Go Army!
Good lord. > STATISTICS ARE BAD, WE MUST RELY ON ANECDOTES!
There‚Äôs no evidence that 12-step programs work any better than no program, so you‚Äôre not missing anything if you quit. Good luck.
Yeah, my bad
At least this person sounds like they don't want to be fat. They just need guidance m
The BBC covered up a pedophile story involving high ranking politicians. No thank you. They are basically the public relations branch of the government.
Pig Latin kills me internally this is why plastic surgery exsists.
‚ÄúWHY CANT I BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM AND BE A [NAME] TOO‚Äù Muh purity test
This sounds like a toxic relationship for the both of you. Seems miserable... I‚Äôd hate to be in that relationship
Haha I can imagine! Good on you for doing it though.
The original video was debunked. Do you agree or disagree?
Best FHE lesson idea ever.
This is super old news
Awesome, it looks like we've found our next scapegoat.
I love how they cannibalize each other.
That's the spirit!
Our team just gave up the moment that happened and all went to top lane to have a b-step party with the other team
I have a long term plan. I appreciate the concern.
I wouldnt mind seeig a few rushes with that NFL overhead cam.
I gagged at unwashed zebra hoodie.

You don‚Äôt have to look bi to be bi lmao
ill yes, but hater you if you mean from the Southern US
> This isn't where I parked my car Seriously I can't find my car.
I tried Skelth, it's pretty old and feels like not too active anymore.
Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
This was driving me NUTS!
Oh my [NAME]. Yesssss.
Thank you for this very informative answer. I don't play the game but you really explained well why they put this system in place.
No offense but this shit just not working in some people. So they likely to say they are placebos(same applies for me too unfortunately)
The saddest thing is you will never understand how absolutely idiotic what you just said is.
"BDS is a discriminatory bigoted hateful movement. It's not just ""Oh, I disagree with some things that Israel has done."""
makes me wish friendly fire was a feature
It really does. Great point
Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.
aha American Sniper, movie genuinely moved me.
Calling people NPCs really gives you insight on how easy it seems for them to kill and attack others.
[NAME] saying [NAME] is already the best shooter on the team got my hyped too
Same director for both series, and one of the best in the business.
How so? How do you keep stupid people from voting?
I just went to post this but you beat me to it lol
Because sending a defenceman to a 3v3 tournament is much better than one of the top goal scorers in the league right now.
I don't think playing with her hair would work. Thats just creepy.
This offense is just painful to watch.
Let‚Äôs just start with the reason of why you left [RELIGION].
Brb gotta go talk to my sister. And therapist.
OH YEAH we had a Rogue and a Bard, also a barrel of oranges and a cart to carry our stuff
It's some freaky stuff for sure!! How legitimate do you speculate the experiments are?
Gettysburg is awesome, I've been twice. I want to go back as an adult! Have fun!
The workers are going hoooome
Because they're forgettable major label garbage that paraded around as punk because they care about more animals than they do people, that's why.
Damn hippies.
Enjoy your gold!
Another thank you, this is great info.
RUM HAM!
if your former manager is receptive in re-hiring you, it's a positive first step. your email is fine. good luck!
I love [NAME] as a player. I still think the best is yet to come with him. Just praying he stays on the field.
That's actually legitimately hilarious. I'm going to have to start following this [NAME] fella
People back then just might have had a bad memory and kept forgetting about it.
Nah. [NAME] has no chemistry with [NAME]
Mother‚Äôs Day is the worst.
"It' kinda ironic that ""Winners"" are actually losers (they haven't realised that yet)"
Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants.
But it is over boyo
Yes. Things come back fast, though. I think its an aspect of the 'eternal adolescent' brain.
Oh ok. Guess the official US statute itself doesn't count?
5.5C is the actual temperature in there??
Just to clarify, we're supposed to assume that if the female character knew the secret, she would NOT be willing to eat the burger, right?
Thank you!! Makes sense, I was deciding between laxes and stool softeners so I think I'll just go with the lax teas
I wish that show would come back
Do it, and then post pictures. We're all counting on you!
We're like bad luck lightning rods. Everybody around us is safe
This comment cursed us.
"I love how you're getting downvoted for understanding ENTPs better than the ""ENTPs"" in this thread."
Thank you, I didn't know about this sub but I'm subscribing immediately
So what‚Äôs the upside. Toner makes the elastic in your skin tougher? Serum for vitamin C does what? Thanks for sharing.
Sure. But [NAME] was well aware of the problem re GST and didn‚Äôt mention it until he was filling in his pension application.
I'm not sure anyone has asked, and feel free to not answer. But is your feeling that the team definitely favors [NAME] right now? 
I hope someone got fired for that blunder.
Good news. Good for you buddy. Hope all of us get back our money soon :-)
I know, i read that previous post. Im just worried about your parrot getting injured because of that woman :/
Didnt find a GF before i stoped looking, been with her for 6 years now
Or, [NAME] is upset we aren't in the playoffs.... You know. He only really cares about winning ..
>So that was a **fucking** lie. FTFY.
I mean I just screenshotted this out of my news feed.
Basically you are saying be [NAME]?
I agree. Pockets especially on dresses just feel weird.
[NAME] is a hero I always saw it. But seriously I love his video essays and im so ecstatic that hes a raimi memer!
This isn‚Äôt really new... or at least isn‚Äôt a new idea. Has it just now been shown in research?
That entire family is so embarrassing.
why does he look like [NAME]
I would be more offended to be served cereal on a plate.
Now I can‚Äôt unhear it...
Orange man = bad
Technically it‚Äôs the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
>the satisfaction of knowing how bent out of shape you're getting What a sad existence.
Reddit culture is truly the worst.
I know that, but they wouldn't comment.
Does include bad cgi, tho?
I do. Am chemist. Stop serving me things that remind me of work, goddamit.
Not to mention people who illegally own guns probably aren't going to admit it for a study either.
So why not leave it in his garage with the doors locked?
I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt the only person who wondered about [NAME].
I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one with this stuck in my head now!
Wow, I wasnt expecting that to be a real sub lol that's awesome
> us common peasant imbecile [NAME]. At least you admit it.

I am so happy that sub exists
oos? im new lmao my rep is only 32
"""We're sorry, all circuits are busy now due [NAME] lost keys, try your call again"""
You‚Äôre disgusting. I hope your wife finds somebody much, much better than you.
And it's been drummed into them since birth that not working = lazy bum/death and homelessness.
>it promotes the idea that an individual's vote doesnt matter An individual's vote doesn't matter, though. That's just fact. 
I'm so so so sorry this happened to you friend. I hope [NAME] had a lovely life üíó
she tries to stop you from busting out of the cell after [NAME] takes aj
... that's inflatin' LAOP's frustration?
As a whole, yes, if it wasn't for Classified being the greatest thing to come to zombies since bo1, then I'd have to agree.
women dont seem to think so.
ME drunk [NAME] kiss ma girl like
Why is this my fucking friend [NAME] üòÇ
I give either a book or music my full attention, not 50% :P
Ugh can you imagine marrying into one of these families?
M'loled at this.
If that were my car the spare would be flat too, so at least you've got that going for ya.
Of course I might not like it because of where I am at I‚Äôm sure not all places are so horrid .
So long, and thanks for all the fish. 
Is everyone the same person
We could open a little hotel and fix up a beat up old boat up nice. Get busy livin or get busy dyin.
You're too ugly to even bully
[NAME]? Yeah, that one hurts.
Nah you bunch have the lot cornered on making your problems everyone else's
I don't even know who he is but I think he approved me to submit in his subreddit.
Aww how can you hate the little darling, it's so cute 
I love how someone put a laughing emoji on that.
I agree. I watched this one because it was literally the first one I found on TV. It was awful.
Wiretaps and catching low-level guys and having them flip on their bosses/co-conspirators. Source: Watched a lot of TV.
[NAME] turned it into one, because they insisnt on being on the wrong side of history for every single god damn issue.
Go to McCalisters and get their sweet tea, THEN decide.
Your post : 39 minutes ago THE POST THATS LITERALLY UNDER YOU WITH THE SAME MEME : 40 MINUTES AGO
But I promise ‚Äúit‚Äôs only something other people do‚Äù.
They should get checked for everything. No reason not to.
Wow. If it shows calls on the bill then what good is it? Glad I asked...
Everyone loved the Snacks trade.
This was the scene that hooked me on the show.
No compromise, the Democrats are finally showing some goddamn backbone. 
Can we get a Chargers coach for [NAME]. They always seem to coach up their players in that position.
I've found that reading before bed helps my brain get tired without needing to exhaust myself by staying up very late.
My best friend waited 5+ years for her boyfriend in prison to come out. Two days before coming out, he dumped her.
I need the snapchatzzzz give me names damnit
I had to put Bird Box because it's the only direct to streaming movie I saw. I feel dirty.
*me trying to get it* OH!!!!!!!!!!
I saw gluten free cat grass at the pet supplies store once. Did not know that was a thing
I have been contemplating taking him to a TLM. You are awesome!
Stay away from any of the Firkin pubs, they recycle the beer and fries! ü§¢
My [NAME] He is a BEAST. Every possession he makes someone his bitch. Are there any injury concerns past the injury he got before he left the team?
Waiting must be really boring
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know they put out the entire song. Thank you! Have an upvote.
Is there anything else you're interested in besides [NAME] & [NAME]?
It would bother me so much to be so dependet from a Person. I am sure there is a way you can go without a person sponsoring You.
I saw that comment and wondered if someone was going to post it here. I almost feel bad. Maybe they‚Äôre lonely.
I'm new here from the U.S. This convo cleared it up for me, so thanks.
He did get 3 stars broüò≠
[NAME]. I‚Äôll keep my teeth thanks. They‚Äôre better (and more useful) companions than a weird dude.
That's because there are a lot of other attrocities that have happened since then. [NAME] aren't the only ones facing discrimination.
Broad city is my favorite. I need a BFF like them
Not until she's 30, because adult women are not your property to control even if you are their parent.
How are we playing, just tuned in
Ouch. Those geriatric insults are the most spot on, aren‚Äôt they? That and during my peds rotation.
Good luck.
Really visually haunting though. For me, it makes me think of strange alternate futures and dystopian sci-fi worlds. 
I heard he was a vegan so it didn‚Äôt matter that he died
Sure you can, but the question is whether or not the kid will listen, or if you will upset the parent. 
Omg, the hands touch the chicken, go off screen and then touch the salt. My mind is contaminated with Salmonella. 
That‚Äôs terrible; I would be devastated. You had to get out of there though. I‚Äôm thinking of you.
Oh right. I can probably google it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs in horrible taste, but I‚Äôm like dying to know now
I think they're doing it so they can ignore the fact that [NAME] served [NAME] to champions at the White House lol
And most ironic. We created the language but people still don‚Äôt properly understand us as the mutated the damn thing
Different personalities, I've always been like that with friends and family.
My wife is not allowed to flick my ears for any reason, and apparently I'm not allowed to stick my finger into her bellybutton lmao.
I've never seen anyone do it successfully on a car, but I'll concede that it could definitely be possible.
yep. I feel guilty for throwing them out but they're basically useless.
Lakers running an awful lineup and [NAME] was too dumb to change it after the timeout. Thibs levels of Stubbornness
This is the most majestic effortless mullet I have ever seen. The blending, the way his wavy locks lay. This is incredible. 
That's all good, thanks for commenting.
That extraterrestrial little grey creatures don‚Äôt exist? That‚Äôs definitely a fact but I‚Äôm very open to any evidence/proof of the contrary lmao.
Blade and Soul looks terrible, IMO. Way way way too much saturation and bloom. Great post, OP!
"""I love games. That's why I keep all those zip ties, plastic sheeting, balls gags and cattle prodders in my trunk."""
You know what I love abou you [NAME]? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice.
It is incredibly dangerous which is why there are professionals for this, also these professionals use a saber and not a kitchen knife
The look on her face when she lies is like one I‚Äôd expect on a 6 year old who thinks he‚Äôs being cute.
There's no way I'm sitting through all of this. Good [NAME].
Beautiful place, been there in September!
I agree a congressional library of excuses already. fella should try to hit the trim asap and get over her asap
Of course, you're /u/Utkar22 !
That depends. Do you have 4 legs?
Not sure who they went to, but free in my state (Ohio).
Fall of religion also plays a role. I'm not religious at all, but I understand how it brought people together as far as a community structure. 
He had a dark haired mother and white-blonde haired dad. He's got his mom's looks. That's it.
Yep. He would also probably have had a not insignificant ‚Äúmetoo‚Äù moment.
You're trying too hard
Is that listing not supposed to be a joke?
Sleep tight [NAME]!
That‚Äôs kind of the point of comment sections.
Thanks, but please use the stickied megathread for all discussion and submissions. Repost it over there.
Congratulations!! Colorado is an amazing place! I just moved away a year ago and miss it terribly :) Best of luck to you!
On my first date with my now wife, who is an MD, she said she was intimidated by me. I think it was the suit though!
Yea ur probably be super drowsy tho.
A) at first it looked like sex doll B) aren't the staples gonna sting you in the ass at some point?
going to keep that in mind for the next time [NAME]
I like that that guy didn't make a snarky remark in 2015 because he was upset that another MP was sitting in his usual seat.
Your stupidity and your attempt to reframe the argument when the facts are laid out clearly is astounding LOL
The moon can.
[NAME] ruled out due to injury. [NAME] starts. [NAME] to bench. Doubtful of a win now.
Ours came today too :). We got 22 hbu?
Out of curiosity, why won‚Äôt you play Odyssey?
Ah, I remember you. You were mentioned on this subreddit before as a magnificent player.
You want a fight, and I‚Äôm just not up for one. Good day!
Nice work gang!
[NAME] doesn't know the pain of CHRONIC MASTURBATION though. So I think [NAME] has the right
So what you are saying is that you are not a serious guitarist is you use finger guards?
She's a moron for running out in traffic. Deserved all she got.
They should do it even harder now to spite you
Go watch a show
...not enough headphones for [NAME]? Also, [NAME] looks like a New [NAME].
Oh I see it now
the Bulls turn cap space into cash money. Doesn't help or hurt the team, but makes the owner happy
You don‚Äôt know what love is till you‚Äôve fished a turd out of the bathtub for someone.
Poor kitty. All you can do is give her extra treats, playtime and cuddles. 
One of his most underrated and nostalgic songs ever. This song has a special place in my heart.
I wonder how big a problem this really is and what the cops' plan is.
[NAME] weapon is gambol shroud but I nearly forgot about the gunchucks they are pretty rad too
You guys don't know what you're doing to me
If your greed kills 2 people, it's worse than your murder killing 1. I don't know how this is hard for you to understand. 
Oke thats really disappointing of him. Although his thoughts are constanly changing. He used to even be an ancap at some point.
dude - just get the hell outta CA ! there's plenty of other states without the immigration problem rampant in frickin california...
Mind boggling. Truly. This is the same deal SHE negotiated. Why didn't she find out if her party would back it BEFORE she signed it?
Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this.
I love me some RFM. My wife said he talks like a robot.
Let's be real though, the waifu is probably younger than his kidfu
Skip the middle man, squish them up my anus and vomit out the skins and seed
Is this a scene from Avengers: Endgame?
Can you blame us after the article?
"""And then I apologized and expressed remorse over the situation"" "
Two sessions, actually. He apparently found the party boring
Yes, this! You are too young to wasting your time with this. 
I just love that this is appropriate for football now/again. #FuckLA
if you have a problem with it, don't take your kid to see the story time show. PROBLEM SOLVED!
and here we all thought they just didn‚Äôt know what they were doing
Challenging experience and knowledge with your opinion is condescending and patronising. Don't do it here.
She also takes it off to shower, work out, wash dishes, etc. 
It wasn‚Äôt, [NAME] threw it out first, I just thought the no charisma was the better burn.
Oooh I see! Oh god yes, [NAME] is one of the best things about England. I also quite like [NAME], for my sins!
I know! I would absolutely do this as well. I‚Äôd love to to a AMA with him to find out more.
But come on babe, you know you want me babe...l.o.l. JK Babe ;)
if my legs looked as good as the dude in the red, i'd be rocking shorts like that too
You have to be a patron for that.
This has to be bait.
It's genuinely disorientating to witness it.
Because it's quicker. Time is money.
Is there any attempt to use non-tainted symbol and to steer a non-hateful discourse in order to represent their pride?
I need help with corsets but otherwise would be mortified to need help for every day clothes.
Haha...what kind of fan base would do that?
I am [NAME], [NAME] is my Husband and we're adopting [NAME] baby.
Haha, just like teaching.

Yikes, maybe [NAME] can pull some [NAME] magic with him 
And no fall damage
Unlikely, but who knows? Memory speed rarely makes a difference in gaming, but I've seen stranger things. 
Subpoena is still one of the weirdest words I‚Äôve ever seen
Try posting to r/mentalhealth I'm sorry this is happening to you and I hope you get better.
He's the only dignified politician, but it's still bizarre that people can be so enamoured of a literal [NAME]
Damn, this is some cold, hard reality. Hope everything works out!
Thank you this is really inspirational
I once heard the rotting carcass of a trash Panda works also thats if you cant get your hands on a fresh chinchilla
Idk I‚Äôd kind of like [NAME] to come up next year. [NAME] still scares me a little. Not saying I don‚Äôt like the guy
I love rock music but I enjoy draft punk too.....*feels bad man*
Yea ur right on that but that doesn't really negate my statement on the blitz.
You would know if you weren't such a Filthy Ricefield Peasant.
That's crazy I just watched two of his movies last night. Unbreakable and split. Very interesting movies.
With those ugly f'n belts
Beautiful view!
Gee, thanks for waking up after being told for over a decade.
Lots of free stuff for Mission Presidents]( and [Q12-Q70.
Protesting in general is an emotional response. People‚Äôs attachment to their cause grows stronger in the face of confrontation and adversity.
Water is not a human rights. That's absurd.
I discussed this shop with my cop buddy, he also trusts it. Thanks!
Thanks [NAME].
Read any [NAME] comic, he‚Äôs definitely super at tons of stuff.
Not even in The Twelve Days of Christine? She was amazing in that.
Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else
No I made the best of it, we had so much fun. Can‚Äôt wait to go back! 
No, but do you want my panties in yo mouth?
Thanks for the info. Not sure if it‚Äôs even worth it then.
32nd? It felt like 99th or something...
Meritocracy ftw!
I root for anyone that is playing against the Patriots I don‚Äôt care who.
You're right. I forgot more Democratic seats were up for reelection! Thanks!
It actually takes less clicks now to get a full stack of items than before.
Oh alright fair enough haha. If the sabres dont pan out I'll root for him also!

So sorry that was his response. I hope you're able to get free soon so that you can begin to heal and move on.
I don't about bringing it into the country but CBD is everywhere here

It is fascinating that people spend billions of dollars on superhero fantasy yet they hate a real life superhero.
Yeah, so dont make any sudden movements when cops are getting you out of a room where you were reportedly aiming a gun at people from your window. 
"My bad. I typo'd. It should have said ""how""."
Lip piercings would be painful bloody and easily pulled out... Nipple piercings hurt tremendously if ripped and are also easily ripped out
Apparently, they couldn't believe a massive corporation (that they're loyal to) finally called them out.
Doesn‚Äôt frustrate me at all. He‚Äôs not worth the asking price. Plain and simple.
The ones who agree with her are the only ones who actually address *her* issue....which is how to deal with boundary stomping relatives.
Because [NAME] base are also the kind of folk who like [NAME]. In the end it only helps him.
This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
He's also a chaser and is convinced that shouting at someone is an escalation from a shooting spree. He is incredibly dumb.
Wouldn't mind if it is [NAME]. Girl's got fire.
WYA? I'll come through.
I‚Äôm single I‚Äôve had it thrown at me But I‚Äôm being more choosey about who I spend my bed with this year

Good for you
That‚Äôs just proof positive they aren‚Äôt meant to be.
LONDON I honestly don't even understand this one
Is this something from [NAME]?
She doesn't sound like a good girlfriend then, assuming you've done nothing to warrant such jealousy.
I wish someone would do this for me.
This subreddit must be filled with mercy mains lmao
I, too, thought it was carrying a dildo
*10 minutes of awkward roleplay*
YOU DONT SAY
I honestly predict a riot on the scale of the 2011 ones if we undergo a no-deal brexit - possibly even worse. It's terrifying.
Good. Thanks everyone but finnaly some reading material. Many thanks
Just smile and wave boys. Smile and wave.
Get yourself a ¬£1. Still occasionally get them.
Thank you I love you
My two favorite bands are Queen and Panic! At The Disco.
I agree, thanks for the help and sorry for the late response.
Wow that's some great facts and logic you're arguing with.

I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. 
Damn, learning from Hungary real fast I see 
The fact that entities go around violating rights is not an argument that we should keep them.
Honestly I think most of that sort of stuff existed between the 1985-2012-ish. Depending on your age most young people would have experienced these.
Yeah.... I've always sucked at smiling honestly. I hate it. I hate selfies. I usually don't smile.
INTRODUCING BUD LIGHT LIGHT for the [NAME] a beer consumer! Just when you thing Bud Light was light enough we managed to water it down more!

Chugging hot sauce is for retards, not for serious chefs.

I think everyone should watch the first season. It's hilarious, but also a pretty brutal indictment about what a show politics is.
Having good people around you is the most important part i am glad you found some good friends:)
Hard Candy. You're welcome.
According to BluePundit you should delete that if you care about upvotes, lol.

that was absolutely beautiful
This did not age well lol
I was in the hospital two years ago and definitely had His help! My family saw some signs. It was very amazing.
Him and [NAME] should get together and make some super-babies
Just gonna say it. Bahahahahahaha
Yeah I want all our players to have a nice healthy hatred for Texas. Good way to ensure they get hyped to play em.
I get migraines too and I‚Äôm sooo tired the first two days of my period
For real. I can understand holding the enemy in a useless area, but people gotta keep their eye on the ball.
It‚Äôs amazing what they can justify to themselves. I‚Äôm not sure if I can believe anything out of her mouth anymore.
If we made him stop once we can do it again!
Oh that‚Äôs so sad that she thinks anyone cares about her opinion
No, I have been avoiding doing anything until it's actually fixed because I don't want to give them any reason to drag their feet.
Ice in his veins... D'L‚ùÑ
Go exercise together. Eat healthy. Drink plenty of water. Time.
12 players had points! Everyone except [NAME] had a shot on goal!
[NAME] done fucked up.
I merely suggested he see a doctor based on some weird symptoms he is having that cause him to not be able to interact with others very well.
I'm with the photo guy. It would be an awful feeling to watch your date flirt with some other dude ON YOUR DATE.
When I opt out it goes back to old reddit, but the next day it turns back on.
Thank you for answering me, I did ask him Straight forward but he just told me is busy 
I guess. I'm going to try getting in better shape, and just socialize more.
I really love this title.
Hopefully they won't try to blame the trucker.
Damnit Morty! D'you see wha-rrrgh-t you've done!? We're fucked Morty, the squirrels - they're recruiting dolphins now Morty. 
Childhood is happiness. After that the rest of your life is spent chasing that feeling, a feeling that you‚Äôll never experience again 
That one little girl with her jersey, nearly jumping out of her own skin to get a high 5 is adorable.
Not in Oregon anymore. They raised the legal age to buy smokes to 21, which, as a smoker, I think is a great idea.
We both will be having a read at these links, thank you! 
But also don't be so aloof that you don't want to help anyone.
Best person available on DL or OL, CB if the two positions mentioned do not justify the pick. Trade back if we miss on all 3. 
Doesn‚Äôt exactly do much in a first past the post, two party system.
I wanna put baby shoes on my giant adult feet and baby stomp all over a cheesebreather's fucking toes
When I see a Lynx, even if far away, oh trust me I'll go to that cat and focus only him before anything else
Wish they would‚Äôve cancelled work when it was -40 last week but I guess that‚Äôs somewhat expected in Canada.
Facilities that serve free food to poverty/low-income people. Tax breaks or etc.
That is really dumb. If you have a crime committed against you, you have a civic responsibility to report it. We need those stats. 
i used that as an example, and i also said it would be very difficult. this is hypothetical there‚Äôs no need to be rude.
He lost his shoes. He‚Äôs legally dead.
Yeah, the death of pharmaceutical producers seems like a weird thing to root for.
I gave up on the show over and over before I adopted 'just skip around'. Ended up finishing all of 3-6.
Our country is in no way, shape or form ready for the risk of a giant inflation wave.
That‚Äôs what the shake is for, though. 
Agree 100% I guess I'm just happy to see anyone, even total scumbags, willing to criticize dear leader. 
Nice dude, aimheros just what I've used.never heard of kovaaks. Thanks for the tip, I'll give it a try tonight.
That [NAME] missed layup is haunting me right now.
They REALLY dropped the ball by not playing [NAME] singing Sussidio
lmao it's true. I'm cracking up about it.
This is not Texas exclusive slang. I've lived in the Midwest and the east coast, everyone uses this slang...
Don't worry, with a lifestyle that requires them to have a new hip before the age of 20 they won't be making it much further.
Omg this is so amazing ! Keep up the awesome work and have a fantastic New Year !
Plus like why would they go for the head? You‚Äôd have to break both of his legs to stop [NAME].
Yay! Nice work everyone. I love reddit.
Because it's stealing from her company.
Do you need someone to talk to [NAME]? Your comment history is pretty disconcerting.
Don't worry dude. The ladies could never see it if you remain to be a virgin and keep your pants up.
Oh, I definitely got muted, too.
Lest go CHO
Irrelevant what is deserved, as if that's objective. The only thing that matters are the facts and they don't support a move like this.
But they're here to ~~buy properties for their family!!!~~ I mean study, they're here to study!
FUCKACTIVISION THEY RUIN EVERYTHING
Come on really. I‚Äôm for gay rights.
I bet there's something delicious in there that hornets do make
What strain?
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
Two natural right backs is fine. Then the pretend one doesn't have to pretend anymore.
Oh yeah, definitely. Sometimes I was with three people while on one date.
Not taking this position necessarily but you could basically argue the referendum was ratfucked by right wing propagandists and call for a second referendum to confirm the outcome.
‚ÄúYOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO GET THERE HUMAN?!‚Äù
LOL!!! Good one!
Send it!
I love that username
Oh my [NAME] yea!
Omg lmfao!!
Classic imperialism at its finest
I know a few dudes that would lose it over a gal like this
look at my other comment
Oof. As a [NAME], and a member of /r/Ryan I'd like to say that this [NAME] is in no way representative of the Ryan population.
Interesting to see the bulk of people in that thread are pretty anti-[RELIGION].
Thats a red flag that you're a big part of his son's life after 5 months. This all seems very immature, both you and him.
A good character driven story? I don't think this guy watched the same movie as we did.
What if I don't fully have feelings for her and just really like her cuteness
Viva la tank
That lil cat, I want it!
You know [waves hand] Everyone.
Lol that's my cat, he sometimes does that when he eats too fast or we switch his food, he is okay haha
No, sex is a reward, and he doesn't deserve it.
I know he comes with a lot of baggage but i‚Äôd probably go with [NAME]. Just look what he did for [NAME].
What a beautiful message - it's all about love, and I hope it sinks in to some of the COB people who might see it.
Sounds like you know the answer, and at first she will resent you. But hopefully over time will realize what your doing. 
yes, very sexist
It did have an awesome geocache lol
Next drag superstar
There is clearly something really goddamned wrong with the policy then.
I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!
Living with her, he just might be!
De un tronco a otro. I hope they wake up!
I thought we traded away our losers like [NAME] and [NAME] already.
It's not much, but it's honest work.
I only like felicity when she‚Äôs with black siren.
Ask him if he wants to a warm glass of shut the hell up.
That's what I heard. ü§£ I'm just curious if calling the cops on [NAME] would hurt him or not.
Fuck a newspaper
I'm more worried about it randomly saying daddy across the top ... Like that's normal
I'm a fan from Oregon and listen to KFANN alot. If PA i sucks so much what do locals listen to?
MTV loves Indiana
It was a stroller so no real harm done. Thanks for asking x
[NAME] is a brilliant player. Glad to see him get more time.
Thank you for your opinion. I think I‚Äôve been improperly placing myself in the comments too much, accidentally misusing this sub.
It's happening on the Villians side, too. Someone joins, sees Dooku is taken, then quits.
Been a weeb for yrs and i still cant understand besides a few phrases
This is adorable! But I don‚Äôt understand how he does thatüòÇ
You are a wize man. This was a brilliant conversation
The worst part is that if you had done the exchange, you probably still would have gotten in trouble. Gotta love retail.
What does [NAME] do?
I brought it back up they are with amway and LTD
you really gotta emphasize the ffffffhh
people who get the weird pics: * aoc * [NAME] * [NAME] people who get normal pics: * everyone else who takes the corporate money and plays their game
I took a marijuana doobie this evening around 5:00 p.m. after my dinner at Country Kitchen Buffett and I am now tripping.
I just gave you a quote direct from the current finance minister regarding the supply. Get real, man.
[NAME] is such a gift. I love him.
This made me chuckle
4 year old. The hardest part is only seeing him half the time bc I‚Äôm the primary care giver in the family
At what point in your life did you realize you weren‚Äôt into it? (I‚Äôm also not into it)
You‚Äôre either mentally challenged or a troll, and if its the secondary you‚Äôre horrible at it. 
> IMO the actual root of people's annoyance is that she's an outspoken progressive Not entirely.
Funny a lot of rich kids think 100k a year is very feasible.
Yes, we no longer have the necessity to eat animal products. Thus the only difference is pleasure.
that would be so cool!!!!
I love this comment
My nerdy ass miss read that as [NAME]
Omg her fake laugh there. I cringe.
It's also why someone I know is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon. It's very grim and morbidly lucrative in the US.
This kid in the future
Autistic space AIDS
Stop following me around you one hour old troll account.
Was he transporting animals?
One more reason for us to have our own space program.
Walking into Chick Fil A feels like walking into a church. No thanks. I will forever see them as a bigoted organization.
No worries! üòä
So very sweet! Brotherly love
if only we could blast this type of stuff out there for everyone to hear, then we might just get get those neo libs to the realization.
Damn [NAME] great move
It‚Äôs like. They didn‚Äôt even try to catch her lmao
I have already, what's your point? 
I'm happy for you!--what's your regimen? Must be radical. And I totally don't mean that in the 90s slang way.
Looked ugly.
This architecture will be treasured even more in a couple of generations. We must act now to conserve it. Btw, happy cake day, slaphead.
I mean, this very post is climate change denial related, which has zero to do with the second amendment, so I don't get your point 
Congrats! Wait till you get your first date and you‚Äôll feel even better.
"So the price goes up until it's worth it for UK people who want to ""work for a few months and make some money"""
I'm just happy anybody's talking to me. I'll listen again :-)
They'll investigate themselves and nothing will happen. Detroit police bully everyone. An they wonder why no one likes them, Respects them, Or why people run from them. 
Awesome quote.
Disgusting performance. [NAME] appears clueless.
Just keep it. You‚Äôre going to go through more brain damage than it‚Äôs worth.
You didn't write that very clearly at all. I Wish You Would is a cover anyway, and I highly doubt that was the point of the tweet.
The Patriots dethroned the Rams and the greatest show on turf, it'd be cool for the Rams to do the same now.
Not even going to open the link. Already know I agree with Sloss.
He claims the starting job and we make the playoffs, I think it would be hard to argue against him.
If you are still trying to lose weight you could post it with a comment about how you found it an inspiration to drive you forward.
Think you're forgetting about the shooting of [NAME]. 6 dead, including a federal judge. 
[NAME] is a madman and I love it.
Lmao thanks for the update!
This one sentence of humor has overridden all of the trolls thoughts today. Thanks for the chuckle.
good thing i never called him a journalist and wrote multiple sentences about how his comedian instincts make his interview show bad.
This is so not aww.
Go away [NAME]....
That whole chart looks like something someone made up to post on incels.
 ### A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one 
Right, but we want to shit talk them directly. Not agree with other people shit talking them.
Not a perfect game with the error
It‚Äôs objectively a lie. Prove me wrong
Hate that scene? Believe it or not, jail. 
If I tried that I would lose badly, get laughed at, and be back at square one.
Elections have consequences.
True only it's much harder to hide real property than it is to hide cash.
I know eating and drinking soy products increases estrogen. Although I‚Äôve heard having/consuming too much estrogen can lead to health problems.
350 calories The large is 20 oz and it‚Äôs 140 per 8 oz so 350
I was forced into college and I wasted my gpa :(
Well she‚Äôs still kind of awful but she‚Äôs hilarious. Definitely a huge improvement. I could barely watch her!!
That seems real terrible, does that actually work? Negs should usually be playful at worst. 
Oh don‚Äôt worry, I have an oil for that
it‚Äôs fantastic with reflex or holographic
Lol nope. She helped me alot through it. I'd say [RELIGION]/parents made me miserable
Never played there but it seems Portland Meadows might be the spot.
Double doink Love it
Utah is terrible, I hated driving through there at night
she does look like a hooker though lol
Yes. Source: still getting paid.
Thank you xo
oh, rich people loooooooooooooooooooove to prey on the poor, they couldn't bear not raping, mocking, humiliating, profiting from, the 99%
Yeah, your initial question was just an innocent little query.
I‚Äôve never heard of this website! Thanks for letting me know.
I would post on r/legaladvice to see if there is some way you could get back to your family and more importantly your cat!
I just wanted to play arcade games together.
B-But big pharma is great! Vaccines everyone! Vaccines! We love big pharma! They never lie! Come on start circlejerking!
I love CoD4
Ah fair enough. Thanks for elaborating
Thanks for the advice. It does presuppose that I am able to have that conversation with him though. Will give some thought to how to do it.
At least it made for hilarious responses by people being aghast by the price.
Heh, unfortunately true. Especially with US medical system which mostly refuses euthanasia of any kind.
Should've left it at this.
it‚Äôs not something you get over, but it‚Äôs something you get through 
Thanks Captain [NAME]. Admiral Semantics was just here, left a message to inform the crew that everything you eat is part of a diet.
You will never be safe as long as the CCP can imprison and torture you
Sadly, I don't even think its that the Chargers aren't prepared its that the Patriots are good at game prep.
I am a young teenager and can‚Äôt drive. Plus my mom would not take me to their places even if they were doing something.
Lol I need details!?
If that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs very desperate. You would think he had some better way of communicating.
Damn! Kids these days don‚Äôt give me much hope for the future. It‚Äôs supposed to be a flaming dr pepper ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Why do people think the ""tide pod challenge"" was a real thing and not just a meme?"
Even the royals aren't immune to it.
You could breathe air, but if you get common air injected into your bloodstream you will be in danger
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind for sure. After I get my Cadians and Lizardmen finished up I'm gonna start looking into Bolt Action
ORANGE MAN BAD GOLD TO THE LEFT
This is me yesterday, oh and today. 
Ive been playing it since this post got loads of upvotes ahahha its great
I got your back. I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Welcome back, [NAME]
The longer you look the worse it gets.
You were inebriated and eating ratshit.
Well the post wasn‚Äôt anything new. We‚Äôve had these posts for pretty much all offseason.
shit. Sorry man :( They have great deals from now and then though via stacksocial. Check them from time to time.
And blames the girl and claims it can‚Äôt be his
Can confirm am big fan!
Thank [NAME].
I loved that show. ‚ÄúThe [NAME] is back!‚Äù
I cringe when I see [NAME] playing while we‚Äôre stuck with sensitive old [NAME].
Pulling for you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è. You got this!
happens all the time (at least to me) when you have a bad ping (80+), games broken lol
She‚Äôs my favorite too. She is indeed hella cute.
Oh that makes sense. But still I think asking a girl to touch her boobs is pretty creepy xD
[NAME] for sure. I really hope we don‚Äôt lose [NAME] though. He‚Äôs basically our ace for the moment.
"ADD is also a DISORDER And yet no one crys ""Why oh why does my kid have ADD? WHAT DID I DO WRONG?!"""
I'm not offended. Just curious.
yeah and then it sucks bc you know you‚Äôll get so sick of it soon and you won‚Äôt like that person or thing the same
cool, I never said anything about communism, that's a pretty wild non-sequitur 
Well, never thought I'd be here, but here I am, someone who passionately hates the Florida Panthers 
China too aha, so much so that the lack of brand is a brand of its own, ironically enough.
>Her obsession with ‚Äúher man‚Äù is weird as shit though. He's jealous. He still cares about [NAME].
I never believe draft rumors of who teams are looking at or wanting, especially if its fan rumors. 
Looks very realistic to me. Ever been to Copenhagen? They did it despite a population density higher than San Francisco's.
We can work on both. Ignore centrists who want to pretend that we have to choose.
[NAME] is having a visible affect on his game and I love it. I think we are witnessing the development of a future star.
Have you not seen a lotion and toner before?? My [NAME].
He's not a believer, so he doesn't see what he did as wrong. 
Wow. This is messed up.
I like your enthusiasm and hope for the same outcome, but as the old saying goes- don't count your eggs before they hatch. 
Psychiatrists are MDs. Psychologists can‚Äôt prescribe. Not sure what you‚Äôre talking about here....
Wha???
[NAME] face be like: ‚ÄúWhen you wish you stayed home instead of being embarrassed in front of 100+ million people...‚Äù
Be single for a while and get your mind right before being with either of them or anybody else.
This is so true cause I always think ‚Äúare they just using me for sex?‚Äù
I'm sorry for your loss ,[NAME]
In America this guy would have been shot before he entered the door
Since it‚Äôs a commercial truck, the driver probably has a CDL.
Because it has rough areas. Which near enough every city/town in the central belt has.
Precisely that. I hope you‚Äôre able to find strategies to deal with it easier, it‚Äôs really tough
I don‚Äôt even know what this show is, it‚Äôs basically ‚Äúincreasingly outlandish things happen to young people‚Äù the TV show.
Your cat is the best thing I've read all day. Take care of your cat!
If they add the yellow boots I‚Äôll be happy. I really like this suit
I'm worried that even in the summer we're not going to have the funds necessary to do that.
I came here to upvote the first throwback [NAME] comment. Wasn‚Äôt disappointed.
It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. 
You are megalophobic, my friend. Welcome to the club.
I don‚Äôt think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
Seeking, not expecting
i think you could say the chat about smelling their own farts was also added for comedic effect
I'm am L O L ! Beautiful! Use that brain. It's a good one. ~toktomi~
It ruined me, too. D:
How much time you got? I enjoy *The Spirit of Redemption* but it's a bit long.
so she's not only stealing kids but fingering her cousin as well? She's pretty wild
Umm that‚Äôs me. Thanks I am youngish in these hollowed halls. Mid 40‚Äôs
I wish I had seen this as a teenager :(
But when you do, just remember that trick so you don‚Äôt have to take your break or get an RI. 
He did great in dodgeball.
The best meme
American children raised by English parents can easily end up with accents resembling their parents‚Äô.
If yous got a problem with Canadian Gooses than you‚Äôve got a problem with me and i suggest you let that one marinate
All the more reason for us to trade down for oline.
He starts mildly enough with a pucker... then when she *backs away* he opens his mouth and goes further. Seriously - what kind of idiot is that guy?
Does 'unintentional humor' mean 'I sneered at this'?
It's like you've never even been around dogs.
Enjoying Mummers. I'm from Philly. I kind of terrified as they just used Skyrim music....
i mean if you really want to play guitar with your thumb there‚Äôs nothing stopping you
Using the logic that 100% of couples cheat.
Didn't even notice until you *pointed* it out. I had a bit of a giggle.
We've been linking that dodgy-as-hell Ukrainian site for years, so go nuts.
It was fucking in!!
Relax. You're going to give yourself an aneury... ...on second thought, keep going. 
Agreed, rarely get mad at ones like hun or darl. Being called boy by an old man however is infuriating.
Dear [NAME], **DON'T FUCK THIS UP** Love, Me
Never stop playing them! I love going against Legions and never see them enough in this game!
put it in a drink, preferably a soda. Its great to sip on!
>I mean look at socialist Germany. Look at Night of the Long Knives.
Credit? For what? Using an old Soviet tactic to insult the church? For encouraging people to kill preists?
please stop pointing your fingers in my face
Dang. A LPT!
It is. You generally need 5 down and 5 up to play reliably. Also wired.
ah fuck. From xbox to zullily? seriously!?
[NAME] is giving y'all some weird energy. I wish [NAME] would do that
You're And no this post was on the front page, I would never subscribe to such a petty and pathetic sub.
If you can spend more time insulting me than insulting my ideas, then someone else here is dumb.
He wasn't chosen for me... He was chosen *for you*. I may have said too much...
You don't suck, jazz is amazing man. Thanks for a album to listen.
They¬¥ve been around since World Pride. I love this city :D
I was hoping this would be a case of r/maliciouscompliance It was close.
I never used the word mean. Chill. I said weak and it is. Its sad aswell.
This‚Äôll end the way these stories always end.
Oh I didn‚Äôt notice the salt before. I‚Äôll leave it out when I made it, thank you!
I first liked [NAME], but disliked her after [NAME].
glad to hulp
YOU SUFFER ON YOUTUBE WITH THE REST OF US.....or you buy their CDs and rip em onto the computer <3
WON ME 1K LAST GAME IN PARLAY!!
I am really sad because my innocent nieces are brainwashed by my crazy sister
True Detective: Season One
You are giving them human emotions. If you spent any time with cattle at all you would realize how silly that is.
Oh yeah I know, but like.. _why?_ it just seems like such a waste of his time.
[NAME] is unbearable. I wish [NAME] had killed her.
And communism wouldn't? The USSR was a master of creating industrial wastelands.
It was squirting all over my kitchen n the nurse. Who then said oh nicked an artery.
Not really, I like staying at home. When I go out for food I'm in and out of the store as quickly as possible. 
De nada!
The whole world is anti-trump minus a few poorly educated people in the south.
I just roam around without a hat. is that so hard?
What is that exactly?
Wish i had more up votes for you.
Same. Even though he‚Äôs dad-dicked us 3 years in a row I will always cheer for [NAME].
Good to hear that! I‚Äôve seen many ppl trashing [NAME] customer service so I was kinda worried
Over under pistons score 87.5
Watched that game in a motel on the outskirts of Albuquerque. Quietly went nuts when he scored that goal
I am the same way. I feel your pain! Therapy and meds are helping me!
I unironically agree with everything on the left side of this.
Trash princess makes me imagine a possum with a little tiara.
Thank you for saying that. It‚Äôs mostly just annoying but I def picked the wrong week to watch Unfriended: Dark Web lmao
Thanks! Clearly I am new to reddit. Thx!
First I thought this was a repost then I realized you posted this five times straight...
For the record I don‚Äôt necessarily want him either. I just think he‚Äôs a compelling person.
Who are these outraged [NAME] women?!
I love this reply.
Very suspicious...
I didn't delete it. Your moderators did. But that's what [NAME] do, they 
Hey [NAME], [NAME] here
That is insane
How about dumb trolls like you who only repeat your own stupid narratives and word-bending 24 hours a day
I like the game tonight
[NAME] just showed [NAME] what a winning mentality looks like :/
She looks like [NAME] as a baby but still as an old man at the same time
Day 7 is tough... Not as tough as day 15 but tough
So much to do, So much to see
I WANTED GENERAL LUCK TO MARCH TO NEW ENGLAND AND *THEN* GET SPANKED UP AND DOWN THE FIELD FOR 60 MINUTES.
I haven't seen the chet response, but I cannot imagine myself not telling that person to go to hell and enjoy a lone existence.
Do not go gendered into that good lighting. *takes selfie*
I just forgot that arguing with people on the internet is useless and like talking to a wall. So Im out.
You and [NAME] guy should be friends
and they‚Äôll be 100 percent right
[NAME] fucking [NAME] are you done yet racist motherfucker, you‚Äôre not helping society
That seems pretty rough. If I ask Google for directions from white center to Fiona it‚Äôs only an hour by bicycle even.
Hey vro!
I'm not surprised.
I am trying they try to say I‚Äôm fake even though I‚Äôm trying it‚Äôs painful to talk to them sometimes
Thank you for the advice. It is really really appreciated. üôÇ
Molon labe!!!
Saying that men have it more difficult in certain scenarios doesn't mean that men have it easier than women in all circumstances. That's ridiculous.
Found his burner

I‚Äôm surprised alcohol isn‚Äôt entirely sold by the state like it is in many states in the East.
The artist's rendition of the Jerseys numbers is quite off. Especially [NAME].
I am sorry but how in the hell is there no added time added ?

If they hadn‚Äôt played the Vikings in SBIII it‚Äôs a guarantee they would‚Äôve lost
This is a throwback game. So many plays in the low post
I really like [NAME] videos
Oh. Well then.
Funny way to oppose fascism - since they are themselves fascists
No he won‚Äôt :)
So she goes to her little boy instead of doctor, I hope?...
Much religion in science??
Maybe if you held onto the intestines, eventually, the pressure of fecal matter would build up until it explodes, killing the individual in the process.
I appreciate that. :)
This is perfect
Even if I did, no one would believe me....,

downvoting for reupload please stop this nobody likes it
You are such a good boyfriend, keep it up!! I‚Äôm jealous :)
[NAME] WOULD NEVER USE [NAME]! HE'S A GOOD BOY!
I feel like you need to get out of your current situation for the sake of your own happiness.
As Kings fans both my brother and I laughed out loud that it wasn't called. Looked sick though.
No thank you, we need to tank, and this moves us 1 gb from the #6 pick :)
god i love [NAME]
It happens way more than you think. People are repulsive.
damn that kid can jump
[NAME] would be proud.
It's not a murder or a cringe. Just seems like two friends joking around.
You forgot fusion
Glad she was a good sport about it.
Headstand, not handstand. Gotta keep that spine in line.
I stopped trying a long time ago. I actually feel much better (most days anyway)
Gee, a GIF that doesn't move. Thanks, OP 
We welcome her with open arms.
Those teeth ain‚Äôt ever coming back
Damn girl, Stockholm syndrome is strong with you. All I can say is I wish you all the best.
So America and the USSR are the exact same thing to you? Sorry you're so small minded, hope you learn to grow in the future.
Why do you think many feminists are angry?
The sick stomach feeling should pass in an hour or two, good luck friend!
**Flair *does* check out.
And DICE has told us fuck all about how they intend to fix it and when to expect the fix.
I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs BS because he found the girl 30minutes ago and his first reaction is to post to reddit about it.
Here for [NAME], love this.
"""Get the fuck out of the fucking chair"", or something to that avail."
At the time they would have. It became endangered and we had to stop.
This isnt a excuse. It affected their start last yr also.
I hear there was a racist illiterate poor woman in a Walmart somewhere in Iowa.

Tech hobbyist scifi fan (me): That fridge is going to get hacked
I related to [NAME] so much in this moment. I hate that [NAME] gone when he reaches for him.
Yeah, try to buy a relationship, good idea...
Why anyone with unnaturally colored hair would even attempt that is beyond me.
Wow there a lot to choose from for 10 bucks or less too
man whenever [NAME] talks i feel like a deaf person because well I just can't hear shit
Lovely experience on the trains this morning lool getting me practiced for being in a coffin
They are unable to think out of the box
[NAME]! Big fan of your graphic novels!
Thanks, I posted a new one with the source 
Somthing flew out of him
I don‚Äôt care about the first seed until a week or so before the all star cut off?
It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something
I hope having family in high places will help me gain opportunities to liberate others.
It was this one apparently it was for forever ago. I‚Äôll delete this post If somebody says so.
Aha! Thank you for that.
Shut up, Mag!
Off topic your username is awesome.
She‚Äôll just be like, not in my backyard!
Gentile is a perfectly fine term (not as coopted ironically by the white supremacists). Do you disagree?
I‚Äôd go back to the 1996 season. That‚Äôs the last time we were in crazy cold territory.
Nice try my guy.
That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.
Wow, that's awesome you heard that in the wild.
I thought that I was lagging. yeah, its really bad.
I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
[NAME] show tonight and i'm loving it
She haven't tried contacting me in 2 years, i guess she lied. Congrats to me, I won the 'miss you more' game. ):
I like the airpod memes other than that haven‚Äôt tried them so can‚Äôt say for sure
ya shes stressed out alot. oh ok. thanks for the advice.
Hi, will mumkey jones be unbanned?

Now that's a beautiful cake but that's way way WAAAAAAY too much icing for me... Added a good 5 inches to the cake damn!!
As a painter in a body shop, this pains me to watch.
From that angle his face looks like the big built guy from jersey shore.
Now this was fun to read! You had more courage than I'll ever have :')
not to worry, I'm on the case.
Franz Ferdinand are awful too
I liked those no-look shots to the face that [NAME] got in on [NAME]
Because that's illegal in Ontario. Even without a lease, the landlord can't simply increase the rent.
....it‚Äôs just raining on my face
Yikes that made me tense up. Not sure I was breathing. 10/10. Very painful looking
Perfect explanation!
This is simple but great.
"She could have handed him her phone and said, ""Fine! You try it!"" "
FUCKING DIN!!!
This is good
I told him I loved him and he blushed so hard. It was the best. Of course that classic smile was there as well
She was also on grey‚Äôs already as [NAME] friend when she was in chemo! She got the experimental treatment and died
I can't wait.
this is why she killed herself you sick freaks
I like this plan. Hope [NAME] and [NAME] do too.
PS4 with pure vanilla setting, after a little practice counter GB and feint is the easiest thing to do
Like an idiot.
He might be happy to discover that he is the father of someone with superpowers! LOL
Brown woman bad
No, just dont show off your books. 
haha, actually haha
Who's the top three craft brewers in the area??
ummmm Wulp I personally love a feminine man. I prefer it, ‚Äòmanly men‚Äô are gross and stupid 
Agreed. Personally I don‚Äôt understand meeting up for just sex, but I still don‚Äôt judge those who do it. 
Cold Stone, I would have been in line
My exact reaction
No, I'm pointing to the fact that you think that without Capitalism, the only alternative reality is the Soviet Union.
I'm not seeing eye patch guy
Which is exactly what ASIRT does...
You seem like a well adjusted individual
Truth Yeah keep living in your reality lol Delusional idiot
No, I mean one of the team's home grounds was literally a high school.
The Lidl ones definitely don't taste like Weetabix, if they are make by Weetabix then they must be using different stuff!

Our ancestors took this land at great loss and developed into something greater than they were capable of being. Their descendants have the rightful claim to the land.
damn those unlimited lorries. Must be in a hurry to get back to Cork.
Or, do you organize when you're mind feels more structured? The old chicken or the egg question. 
When I die, I want [NAME] and [NAME] buried with me.
The [NAME] did send his only son to score for our Pens! We are REDEEMED!
I love assault
Ironic, since [NAME] is literally doing that, but with migrant children
Keep branching out guys.
So like, just today then?
same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
Beyond meat is a veggie patty too.
That sucks. Learn to check your ping like everyone else.
Not at yours obviously. Did you know last tekken champion was a bear player? The lowest tier of them all
A best friend would get me a vibrator. Not something that‚Äôll make me feel like an oily, ugly piece of shit.
No, it means you have a problem with homophobia and paranoia. A big one. No pun intended.
The fact you can remember the games he blew shows how great he was and how few and far between they were.
Is this in New Orleans?? I really feel like this is New Orleans.
Clear lake is really nice (I‚Äôve lived there for 5 years) and I‚Äôve heard clear lake school district treats their teachers well.
Bomb on your chest Do not try this at home
"[NAME] tweet directly contradicts this... Edit: [NAME] said that ""[NAME] didn't make this deal by himself"". The organization chose [NAME]."
Thanks for the sharing your information.
Hot damn! Thankfully only a bump to the head.
Stanley's in Tyler
That'd be amazing! Heard about Newington's reno not long ago. Need to get over there.
It's not about the ladies, it's about the balls.
You're telling me you dont get your meth from there?
:( disappointed, i expected to give out personal therapy cats.
Oh ok cool so I don't feel bad at all about it then.
Shut up cowpoke
"I THOUGHT IT WAS ""PRESS GANGING"" WHERE THEY WOULD RANDOMLY GRAB YOUNG BOYS OFF THE STREETS OF ENGLAND AND FORCE THEM TO SERVE IN THE ROYAL NAVY?"
The most hatful crowd is not the lefties. Lefties may be annoying but hate as such is a tool used by the right much more skillfully and forcefully.
I beat my dad
He's the only one who has managed anything positive in this game
You just needed a [RELIGION] grandparent to be killed
Lol yeah I did, that's why specified the killer, for survivor the fun comes from escaping so tunneling feels like shit
But even then it would need something else to live
Link pls, I need to see this! ( I bet he dropped it)
I like this sub, and I like you. You're alright. 
I like putting myself in the girl's shoes so I love romances.
Pleasure!:)
She is renowned for her versatility.
I've always thought [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are beautiful.
It‚Äôs your choice what you choose to do, but just know you‚Äôll be surely missed by loved ones.
Oh a cat !
Basically. My step dad didn't choose to break his back and his knees. The whale chose to overeat and become obese
And there‚Äôs no reason to drop the f bomb when giving an argument
Beautiful stranger i don‚Äôt have to talk to them after
What the hell is wrong with you?
You all treat him like shit so what do you expect?
you can tell who is in power by who you can't criticize' = Israel
Shame the 'all in' doesn't apply to managers. He has hired some duff managers over the years.
His entire face is covered by a beard and sunglasses lol
Play in traffic
She doesn‚Äôt even like dog fetus, how picky of her
Carelessness will find no clemency in this place! (I was late, it seems that others have already got the best lines...)
That‚Äôs bull crap call.
He meant [NAME] [NAME] hihihi [NAME]
I‚Äôm glad things are coming to light, I pray justice is served for the victims. 
Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :‚Äô)
"""I care about the nation and the world"" and ""I'd rather let trump win than vote democrat"" are opposites of eachother"
ONLY FUCKING MERRILL WOULD MISS THAT
That's probably caused my the extreme density of infrastructure.
i sense a cup hangover for the caps
Shades of Akira / Ghost in the Shell!
The dress was trailer trash appropriate. Did he just run out of money for a good dress? I mean, $300 BLACK UNDIES.
Agree she doesn't deserve happiness since she has taken it from you!!
Tkachuk - Pageau - Stone is going to be our second line. Absolutely filthy.
This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
This just makes me angry.
You laugh at them. Openly. For being childish and naive. If they don‚Äôt react to facts maybe they‚Äôll react to wounded pride.
We put Vaseline on our teeth and lips in theater so our lips wouldn't dry out or stick to our teeth from the lights lol
RantGrumps in a damn nutshell
Someone made this album, dwights a bit lanky but I enjoyed it. 
At least back then we didn't have AIDS.
they just want someone to agree with them and tell them they're right. that's all these sorts of posts ever are.
Aww, look at you still wearing your hospital bracelets even. 
it's quite a large red flag. It depends on the context, but if they are in her dating league, I would be suspicious. 
They remembered [NAME]
Interesting theory. I like your science. I just like the taste and wear protective clothing in case it falls apart.
Well that's Kraaifontein .... Where the kids bite the dogs
Because they don't realize that the Act of Union occurred. Either that or people don't like that this guy is being pedantic.
He‚Äôs so cute! How do you get to hang out with him? I‚Äôve never seen him the times I went to visit.
Lol aren‚Äôt you the guy that got banned from UKPol for being too left wing? I have to say guy that‚Äôs pretty impressive.
That ruling is such a mess: it gets the *reason* correct, but the Justices were so out of touch that the entire ruling was contradictory to that. 
Yeah maybe I over indulged as a young lad!
This story puts me in the mood for a jolly rancher
I felt bad for laughing
Thanks cool sub
How insulting . . . to Beavis and Butthead
Thank you! Very cool!! üòé
Looks like the next level of a horror character
What do you mean when you say picking a side of history
I like this person.
I found an understanding of [NAME] degrees of belief and updated probability extremely clarifying
I agree. His own hair color is much better with his blue eyes.
Why would they stop magicking away their shit. That seems more practical than a giant plumbing network.
Can I potentially levitate 2 inches off the water also, or just the ground? 
I dont think prostitutes are going to teach you how to have good sex ü§î
I know you‚Äôre playin but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if I hear this for real
Let me guess, are you [NAME]?
I‚Äôd go [NAME]. [NAME] gets raked on any mistake I throw personally
>the women's march chairs are so left wing they took a picture with LF.
THERE ARE NO CHIPS IN THIS PICTURE.
i didn't know this could happen.
I like your style, let's not wait on any historians to miss any opportunities. 
Hoooo boy am I ready for a masterpiece
"You are also church people. Just ask her out ""Hey my relationship is open and you seem awesome, can I take you out for coffee?"""
Sleep > class Thats the only way
there's no limit when it comes to owning dogs.. more dogs = more love
Oh, okay. Thank you. I hadn't been keeping up with it.
Of all the people in the world, I honestly can't believe that Reddit hates [NAME].
it's not but damn i'm sorry to hear how common this is
That last panel tho. :( Same dude.
Joining the server when everyone's at 1/4hp and out of ammo, with no damage to your...uh...living room. Yeah, ggwp.
[NAME] did a photo shoot with the first presidency. Hilarious
Yes, the Raptors need to stop committing dumb fouls.
The rhetoric of a troll. That‚Äôs all you got?
> **Gomenasai,** my name is [NAME]. Lmao. 
No problem! I was upset I couldn‚Äôt chose a female rose grey bay Arabian in story mode. I wanted to name her Ros√©
I say it every day, buddy. I'd rather pay more at the pumps than be so selfish that I'd sell out our children's futures.
Why do the religious think an omniscient god needs to test people? Shouldn't it have know who would fail long before it even created the Universe?
It's very convenient!
So jealous lol we don't get to enjoy in TN :(
The Republicans are worse though the NRA literally has to pressure Republican congressmen every time gun control gets brought up.
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING I CAN GET BEHIND
9. Some of us just don‚Äôt like fucking dogs. Fuck off. Stay away from me.
She walked that back today
Thought [NAME] had one
what a shame that online sellers have made malls obsolete
You mean you wouldn't want to be a transhuman cyborg alien experiment? That's not very cash money of you, my friend.
Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
Not sure why he's shilling for [NAME].
What something is missing? Curious on your thoughts
"What a transition...from ""Ab-Fab"" to ""Au-Bo"" :p (don't forget the vodka, it's cold up there)"
Just gotta stop overthinking. Try meditation. That helps control your thoughts better.
But everybody came back anyway
Have an interview in 11 hours and it's after 2 AM bet LETS GOOOOO
I was just gonna say this look like fake karma.
The classic artifact player response to criticism: you just dont understand it loool
And then you see some idiots in the street walking with their speakers listening to reggaeton out loud (at least in Spain).
Dutch bros made this a legit drink. It‚Äôs their cold brew steamed I believe. Edit: spelling
Thank you! I‚Äôll look for his art. Btw I have no idea what Faces of Death or Traces of Death is
My saving grace: ‚ÄúSince we have an odd number of students, is there anyone who‚Äôd prefer to work alone for this project?‚Äù
No that was my cyst that got removed today lol
I'm glad you have someone to help you out! Perhaps over time you'll find it easier.
If they didn't want the wheels to be stolen, they shouldn't have made then so easily stealable!
**If you are not playing with headphones, you should.** That's what my wife says.
"The phrase I used was ""perceived as weak"" and that context was by bullies. You must be delighted you are not in that set."
I am friend
Because [NAME] was definitely pregnant with both a boy and a girl when he got on. Yup.
My friends thought I was asexual
Love that he obviously went out there to do weird sweeping strokes in the snow. Those look super effective
Drink up before it gets cold
Also [NAME] just tweeted about voting for [NAME] as well, they truly do love him
My dog is less uglier than this.
Underaged drinking in Wisconsin... get out no way!!!
I wasn't aware of that subreddit before. Thanks for reading and for the recommendation!
I don't think that makes for a fair deal. That $100 is far more valuable. It's more of a disposable income thing for me.
I care about me and my benefit.. No shits given about you (general you) . It's my job to vote my best interest
I want the Bears to get to the Superbowl because they haven't won one in three decades and my dad is a lifelong Bears fan.
best: buy flowers because you want to make you SO smile worst: keep going because love is what matters not the issues
The NCAA doesn't just decide whatever they want. They are bound by the laws of the United States just like everyone else.
Most [NAME] don‚Äôt really know the difference. Its an easy boogeyman.
Why are you sorry for your grandma? She did what she had to do in order to get what she had paid for.
And [NAME] is the opposite.
I really don‚Äôt want the I told you so moment to ever arrive. üòî
favorite athlete of all time for sure. [NAME] and [NAME] are my other 2 haha. [NAME] up there for my own sanity
I get snuck up on by my papillon I wouldn't stand a chance against an actual predator
"There is no such thing as ""objectively wrong"", so, no, it's not."
Culture war is a two-player game. This would only mean a different tribe would have believed the claims and a different tribe would have disbelieved them.
I got hung up thinking like this for thirty years with my first and only love. Don't let it happen to you.
They won't go after her, they LOVE [NAME]. 
No, its protecting my right to vote. By not allowing people who don't have the right to vote, to in fact vote.
Yeah I mentioned [NAME] but what about him?
"Why are all these links ""np"" links?"
It‚Äôs starting to sound like this season of The Bachelor.
You're setting the bar awfully low for yourself.
Employ the son of your biggest donor?
You do realize that this is the sub for non-Trump supporters to come ask questions to [NAME] supporters. The OPs are all non-Trump supporters
Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there‚Äôs concern it may push her into needing braces.
Preach my dude I know how it feels to get downvoted by the sheep
But if you made that joke about other groups, you would be strongly condemned.
where'd ya get 'em?
>People can literally have conversations with each other just using google. My nipples explode with delight!
I haven't killed one yet, but I did kill someone that had a carcass. I think I got $3 at the butcher.
That‚Äôs impressive. I haven‚Äôt picked up a book in over a year.
Absolutely not. What if a girl did this to you? Instant turn off. She doesn't seem interested. Keep the communication face-to-face at this point.
I wouldnt go that far, but paranoid schizophrenia can definitely do that to someone. Even mild social anxiety can also cause it, though
Lol I'm glad
it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
Seriously Creepy.
My son would rather have more room to roll and wiggle and risk bumping his head than be confined to the much smaller pack n play.
Sorry I have to ask your age before I yell you.
virtual hugs, OP!
And the new sword is kinda shitty, and not even a complete sword at that price. Also, the sword is really bad for the environment.
I wish. Chalk it up to a brain fart
Who exactly are their ‚Äòvolunteers‚Äô? The IRA?
cool cool...
every time you see the snake edge and still get hit even though you *swear* you were holding downback
Was hoping for a per bear on the other side, or maybe a running woodchipper.
It‚Äôs been over 20 years since I rode the 15. I‚Äôm still traumatized.
This has been my dream for years!!!
Thanks, :), as the days go by they are getting better.
RTD lines are free in Denver tonight. Stay safe.
What u/Goyteamsix said.
Why doesn't he jerk it to porn like a normal person?
Because they aren't different subspecies
Umm... I am.
Yeah it seems more like a joke than someone Bible thumping
So many inaccuracies here.....
If you make them get out in this. You deserved the fucking ticket.
Because they saw it once done before.... on IG!
i was agreeing with u/sixstringersoldier guess my analogy wasnt clear
I don‚Äôt get this question as they know full well exactly why I am not married!
Really curious how families handled this in the old days before the modern health care system.
yeah guys, stop complaining about violent mobs and join one!
If an AI projectile is your biggest problem you've got bigger issues, next. 
I have mixed states and rapid cycling too! Super fun
"On top of that I just think [NAME] was saying ""I know how to evaluate talent."""
It‚Äôs spam
I know that‚Äôs what I was trying to say. Idk y that got lost in translation.
Thank you, I needed this to vent my frustrations into üòÜ
Brah me and my fat family would of loved all that butter.
And you're competing for moral high ground on the internet. Hope you feel accomplished.
Time for these shows to be held liable. They're putting abusers on left and right. Even married at first sight etc
It's not cool that so many are going without pay and unable to make rent or buy groceries. Is a travesty that a manufactured crisis has come to this
Great protest! Not being discouraged by the weather or paternalistic criticism, good on them!
I have so much to think about
Always upvote Funhaus
she‚Äôs a huge mood
I love trying new foods for the most part
Don't worry you'll outlive them.
Thanks man! You rule.
Just like you can't underestimate the capacity for evil, you can't underestimate the capacity for stupidity 
He just posted an update. He seems to want to but isn‚Äôt sure if he/his wife can handle a 4yo.
Oh I get it, you are illiterate on purpose because you fear to be fed with lies (in your mind). Sorry for you.
That looks like the Galt House hotel in Louisville. Is that right?
Keep us updated.
She got exactly what she wanted.
The lack of stick skills [NAME] lacks is actually astounding.
Insta/fastmine scam, but yeah, scam none the less.
I'm in a similar boat, had surgery to correct Pectus Excavatum when in 2011, also 18 now, also deal with constant chronic pain.
haha good one friend real neato joke!!!!
the thing they r looking for is money. money makes u survive. people in general like to survive to the extreme sense of it.
it's basically summer here right now. these posts are clueless.
Do I wish people with face tattoos wouldn't be judged? Hell yes! But I'm not ignorant or Delusional enough to believe this.
I'm tired i'm wasted I LOVE YOU DARLING.
They are dumb 43 / 37 year olds.
"The grey shirt guy: ""Oh shoot! I leave the stove on!"""
wow that's dark
I don't make a habit of looking at people's profiles over a simple comment. Tell me what I'm supposed to see from your post history.
Stupid democrats!!!!!!!
Fun fact: not everyone is a guy, although you may not have any contact with women personally
Shucks, that's 11am for me. I might drop in one day when I don't have work. Thanks!
I don't think we have anyone to fill it.
Why do we gotta wait for a week just for the devs to fix their mistake?
[NAME]?
The level of protectionism is insane. This just allows Baidu to expand its monopoly.
If they overdo it and burn themself out it may be.
The best part of froyo is getting to do it yourself. Robot is useless and bad at it's job.
This literally made my day!
What‚Äôs with the video being off?
errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well.
> I'm not really sure why my post got you so mad Because he‚Äôs one of the guys we‚Äôre talking about.
Maybe not harassment in this tweet in particular, but there are difinitely some fans who are still pressed about eliminations and are not afraid to let the queens know
Yes, that might be a good thing
So lifelike!
Can confirm stop interrupting our Shaman bites with your reckless cent behavior
shut up LIBTARD you right now:ü§Øüò≠ü•∫
Thats a negative
Interest rates seem crazy low. It doesn't seem worth it to lend anything except DAI.
Thanks, that's an important point I should have mentioned. 
Very interesting!!!
Yeh thanks man , been into meditation and mindfulness for a longtime , tho maybe not the most dedicated it def helps
>Let's see with all the player turnover he managed to go 8-4 [NAME] still had NFL Caliber players on those Penn State team.
Reminder that [NAME] incel army literally physically assaulted [NAME] fans when she spoke in East LA, including children.
Teachers, do not diddle these kids!
No it doesn't work like that you're wrong
Mine looks like a spider web because it...got a really close look at the floor new year's morning.
No, they aren‚Äôt. 
Absolutely insane documentary. I actually thought it was a parody at one point but it‚Äôs all real.
It's a bitter cycle
he is lying to you
Say what? He has been playing for epsilon till now. Never seen some real accusations on him cheating. I think you should read some more.
love seeing his kids too more [NAME] and [NAME] pls!!!
Their behavior? Going to campuses to talk about fiscal responsibility and [RELIGION] values is something that is bad? You‚Äôre a bigot, just admit it. 
Are you [NAME]? Haha Kidding but shouldn‚Äôt feel that way, you tried it and now try to look for something that will keep you going. 
First thought: OHHH FUCK FUCK FUCK!!! Okay, time for me to submerge and introduce this MOTHAFUCKAS EYE BALLS to these hands
How is one not amused by that? I can't imagine being angry even if it was my lunch. lmao...
Haha. Got ‚Äòem. Also this just in: Los Angeles is expensive. In other news, unrest in the Middle East.
I have no confidence to boost
You‚Äôre a damn good grandma, good wishes for your grandson and good luck!
I think you're right. I've been proactive before and it helped. Thanks and hope this year is good to you as well!
"Damn I got a notif from a (very cute) friend saying ""no u"" on Discord right before I saw this"
Lol, how much XP you get for that?
I don‚Äôt think high fees is something they like... but the rest I totally agree with you!
Man I know youre joking but they swept us and still got the better pick. Pretty lame.
I love you [NAME], you is my only friend.
If this is actually real it is really fucking stupid.. 400mg of nicotine!? Clearly you're looking for something stronger, might as well try heroin..
I love the content the PC channel puts out, its what wwe's channel should do more of
It is odd you are singling me out rather than those who identify with those terms and use them endlessly and with insults.
Actually ugly women are not going to post their pics.
Thanks for the sauce boss
Out of curiosity, did [NAME] mention autism?
I was never a fan of it. It should be a regular foul.
You don't have very good social skills, do you.
It's good at everything, just need a little rest, Even before [NAME] was a high scoring midfielder at one of the worst teams un Italy
You seem real salty, lol. Enjoy having a 4th grade reading level bruh 
This just made my day! Thanks for the laugh!!
Do you have the MVP Giambi card? The stats are nice vs [NAME] but he hasn‚Äôt really performed like I expected
She was behind sesta/fosta just recently. Which has done more to censor thr internet than the net neutrality that everyone freaks out on. This is terrible news.
The biggest issues are in suburban districts. They could probably leave most urban and rural districts alone.
That's an interesting way to do it. I might come off as a little crazy, but this would definitely be an interesting experiment. 
Lol, get em Corsi! 
That‚Äôs awesome, congrats! 
[NAME] and [NAME] at crunch time. I must be dreaming!
Yes that would've been so much fun! You can only imagine my shock and disappointment...
Happy birthday [NAME]
I LOVE WALNUT CREEK
Whiskey isn't going to help. She should pray to [NAME] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life.
I love [NAME]. He's another great option for 6th man.
Sounds like your new chapter has started already, brother. You deserve someone who truly loves you and treats you that way. 
I sorry didn‚Äôt want to disrespect peep but as i said i needs to be dark and about something i like
I just got got and I like it
Well, seeing as how communism is by definition stateless, I'd be interested to hear how one would get communism with a state...
I don‚Äôt set an alarm I naturally wake around 4am. Love my mornings.
So how long was this guy hospitalized? Did he survive to walk out of the hospital? And the guy spotting the ladder?
Money, specifically other people‚Äôs money in large quantities.
Let‚Äôs be friends!!
Your hamstering is beyond entertaining. There are tons of posts, but you can't find any?
My fianc√© and I went to a friends house and just hung out until midnight and watched fireworks, it was so chill and perfect!
And if she isn't? That relationship could be wrecked and your friend destroyed for nothing
Who cares, most people will be on their phone anyways.
Save money and find a good partner so you can be financially stable with someone you love and do whatever you want the rest of your life.
Thanks. We'll do our best :)
[NAME]*, and do you expect them to get fired literally in the middle of the season? 
nsfw exists for a reason tard
Well, that doesn't suck. That blows chunks.
"He gets criticized for being too ""showy"" in his dialogue because people dont actually talk like he writes. But I love it"
That's the only way us [NAME] can successfully learn the hardest language in the world. /s
And then in a weird twist her family tries him for murder. Haha!
But how the‚Äî what the‚Äî wait, why would‚Äîfuck it, I‚Äôm out. 
Well that just sounds awful.
I don‚Äôt see the yes yes yes yes part. Just one big no.
Is...Is this a Hitman themed FE Shitpost?...I dunno whether to be happy or impressed by this.
Would you give your used underwear to your best friend/romantic interest? >!I know I have.!<
The numbers are literally in front of you and not interested and zero categories have different votes. I‚Äôm genuinely starting to question what‚Äôs real anymore
[NAME] has already pretty much called this deal off. I think his words were ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù.
These people have absolutely no confidence in their ability to make a living. It‚Äôs pathetic.
Thank you OP , I can finally look at a picture of [NAME] without vomiting. 
Thanks man!
this is why I have backups off site that they‚Äôll never find...try as they will they will never disarm me
Then a Rav could disagree that Chicken is to be treated as meat? Chicken Parm could be kosher?
Now only up 250,000%!
Lots of tourists like taking pictures with the locals. Don't feel so bad, OP. It's also entirely possible your father was mistaken. 
I‚Äôm gonna make that a sub. Too many juicy targets not to.
This is what I come to this sub for
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it think.
Wow, that sounds like it could be great.
He rapes , but he creates
Philebus by [NAME]. Quite under-studied imo. It's really insightful and a beautiful read.
This is truly the most captivating trilogy I‚Äôve ever read. Eager to read the third story.
[NAME] is a guest speaker in one of my classes this semester. Can‚Äôt wait.
Ahhh, I was curious about that since I do both Postmates and IC at the same time.
Are all the people in that thread praising SB2...SB2? They all talk in a similar manner. It's odd.
Gore magala is my favorite monster in mh4u, you did an amazing job!
Sorry ideologically yeah. I meant morally.
Out-douching the douche often results in two douches mashing together.
Let‚Äôs start [NAME] over him and let [NAME] and [NAME] jack threes with the bench squad
You‚Äôve got to do it! Just imagine all the bitter responses that you can then share with us!
Fear mongering.
I didn't like this, not for even one second. 
Thank you. I hope we can both/all stay true to ourselves and not to become cynical about others due to our experiences.
Apparently he has returned to the bench so hopefully he's ok.
I'm so sorry, please stay strong and know you're loved 
üòÇüòÇüòÇ YES and she fired all her bridesmaids because they didn't text her to ask if she was excited that her wedding was a week away
And wr is not what I want us to focus on anyways. We got plenty of other needs
surprise surprise! cbs loves this phony old wannabee
omg that was full on Tequila [NAME]!!!
"I've met very few ""bad"" people in my life. Most people I arrest are ok people who made unfortunate mistakes."
1) I think my least favorite thing our kid has done would be spit up in my mouth. 2) Vomit is worse than spit up
I thought they were motor vehicle accidents.
[NAME] thank you so much this is so blessed
Might as well do something while you're doing nothing!
...? /u/iBiteYou I think he's finally gone crazy
*I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.*
Thanks for explaining. I hope you'll fill out the survey!
I don't have a problem with this if their hands are clean.
Either you're stupid or complicit. I don't care either way.
Any AI controlled streak should just be banned from day 1, regardless of game. The fact that the pros haven't GAd them all blows my mind.
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
I like how she dabs on the way down.
E√≤rapaidh for me üòâ
thanks, it‚Äôs been so much better
Players salaries are going up drastically every year. They‚Äôre hardly getting squeezed.
The incorrect number of O's has depressed me
Would be really interesting to see how an FMT from a 20 year old would play out in the gut of 60 year old, or vice versa. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. One of my favourite unisex names is [NAME].
This is so bad that I immediately retold it to everyone I know.
I stand by my point: why do you care what he does now.
Who would have thought ! I'm glad he didn't shoot someone on his way down !
Post it! Im dying to know what she looks like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
My kids graduated college two years ago. Guess I missed it?
But no sex until marriage is one of her rules
I used to build a ramp and jump over other kids on my bike ala [NAME]... I was amazed at the time.
Confirmation sounds really scary and sketchy. I can not not think about cults and rituals everytime...
Good for you!
This is great! [NAME] the legend
I always thought a visible/sortable +/- x% ranking would be interesting for that reason.
5 1/2 years until the presidential next election... Let's hope [NAME] can figure something out in that time.
When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.
Nope I'm good to go! My goal this year is to drop a packet for warrant officer.
Yeah [NAME] is a pretty weird guy.
I mean it changes that game at least because if the defender actually wraps him up it‚Äôs a sack because [NAME] never threw the ball.
DAYUM!!!!! This post is lit AF. Got some verbal geniuses on this one.
Well...yeah. It did.
Sounds nice owo
Sounds like a good deal to me. Where do I sign?
Thank you. For what it's worth, I absolutely am an idiot. But I am making a valid argument within the context.
[NAME] had a great idea about this problem actually
I remember that. It was a crushing experience that started a whole other level of depression. But hey, maybe things will work out for you. 
Thank [NAME].
Remember, the little accident with black panthers nomination...
>. Cinders not going to be there when [NAME] fights [NAME]. Shes getting the relic. [NAME] has the Relic.
Hahaha okay that actually made me laugh. Thanks man
He's an altogether better grappler IMO, and so much fun.
I‚Äôll never do long distance again. Good luck broski.
Yes! What the hell is it with ikea? My husband and I don‚Äôt go together anymore.
[NAME] has been waiting for this moment. People actually standing up for her in person to her father and evil stepmother.
She is in a weird fairy tale stage, but then also realistic. I‚Äôm so confused. I guess you be both delusional and logical? 
How long do we have to wait? I might need rehab.
Gorgeous. We headed to the Bob Hall pier to watch it on the beach.
Which is why he's still in the league as a red zone threat, but the days of 1,300 yards 12 TDs are long gone.
You‚Äôre truly welcome :)
Wow. Yeah does your place autograt at 8 or more ? So sorry üòê
Oh that's cheating then lol
It‚Äôs good to be in good relations with other gms. The bulls basically did the rockets a favor. We got money and build rapport.
Don‚Äôt own one and the show is tonight I didn‚Äôt realize this dilemma until a few hours ago
There has to be a term for people who use the Occam's Razor this much to get to their conclusions. Occam's Masochist?
no, the epilogue has one ending.
Hi baby!
Now they can say they tried and that the big evil NRA and the GOP foiled their plans to make America safer.
Fortunately, finding yourself and deepening your spiritual connection with the world only takes about 4 days in a beach hut with a thatched roof.
Got the same pops! [NAME] a lot :) too bad I can barely play him, wish there was a Hwoarang pop
Way to cherry pick. Remember that time that [NAME] person got lit up for like, 9 goals against or something? Man, that guy sure sucked.
I think the OP is looking at a GC and not Cherokee. I see no way that‚Äôs gonna lease for $300.
Damn for that much you may as well use a mobile plan unless you're doing something latency sensitive.
These aren‚Äôt /u/ These are just their nicknames. They‚Äôll know who they are when they read it and that‚Äôs what matters.
Ahah! I bring tidings of good news for you friend, [NAME] has heard our cries and is WELL AWARE of our desires for Co op
Team Hina FTW!!!!
Oh [NAME], even if I had a bf I would be ashamed to have him do that for 
I find that fascinating considering that racism and sexism so often intersect.
Hope so, got them at +1200 just after they beat Duke.
Your logo was amazing, your sushi was not.
Cant wait til [NAME] passes him. [NAME] is an ungrateful mofo. Anyone that praises their own work ethic and hard work needs slapped silly.
This is why I have no sympathy for parents who can't make time for their kids because of their jobs.
I know, I know. I wish Reptile had a better fate. 
makeup call lol
Can you show an example, or is this more of that imagined victim hood we constantly see from the party who wants less brown people around?
So now I can't get defensive when you're being offensive? lol
I have a lot of fun on pre-CU servers, but I like to grind and I love the Star Wars universe
...silly walks
You‚Äôre a badass for recognizing this!! Props to you!
Yeah I‚Äôve been watching these videos and they are great. Really well done.
"""resistance is futile"""
#QUIT HURTING THE BIRDS
[NAME] still the best dev tho. Nice nonsense comparison btw.
This is the funniest shit I've seen all day.
Any one of us could be a journalist, and that level of journalism feeding the masses is mildly scary.
I will definitely check that artist out, if there is something that can lift me up a little bit, it's new music. 
This is so wholesome! I can‚Äòt wait for Animal Crossing Switch! üòçü§©
Is this the real life?
Now comes your affiant, [NAME], law school and attorney credentialing expert. I don't understand what's wrong, though. [NAME] passed the bar.
Just do it... Do her I mean... Get it over and done with.
Much thanks!
The irony here of course is that your degree becomes more valuable when fewer people are able to obtain it.
Something cute and fluffy who gets to nap a lot, lol.
Into [NAME] [NAME] poured her hatred her malice and will to dominate all life on earth .
Originally just a child murderer.
Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it.
I regret looking at his posts.
Money, money, money!
When will he get that pesky hood under control‚Äî oh, it‚Äôs looping
Wow, that's crazy. Ever tried DMT? 
Personally though I like to think of myself as a normy or a snowflake just without negative correlation. C;
Oh! That explains why your teeth look like they‚Äôre covered by something haha
Ah yes of course, how could I have been such a Horseshoe crab!
I'm kinda the opposite. I always look dour and sad even when I'm not...
Instead we'll buy players like Drinkwater, Bakayoko and Zappacosta. 
I love going to a diner and eating in a booth by myself.
I see now, but at that time i just woke up and this was the first thread i saw hah
You must be ecstatic, I'm really happy for you.
What?! Now you are just reaching bro. He's not even the best bodybuilder named [NAME], [NAME] has him beat.
Will do, thanks
Hello [NAME], my new friend. 
He already sucks. Let‚Äôs just nerf him some more.
She‚Äôs fab but the reflection of that guy in the window got me curious tho
You‚Äôre doing gods work.
Second, you accuse everyone who didn't ignore you of being a Russian propaganda poster
I said none of those things. My awareness of a slang term and its means is just that. Understanding language.
I bawled my eyes out, my best girl. 
Haha yea few cars drive worse than a Versa. Aside from performance, what are some must haves/wants?
He referenced us!!!! And we're gonna have to do something about delicious
It's strange i don't understand how work reddit, i drop a link when i create a post but it doesn't work
I would love it! [NAME] has a history of injuries just like [NAME] used to!!! Do it!!
yea i highly doubt that
Anyone else think [NAME] talks too much in this and drowns destiny and hbomb out My man be talkin
Had to pause for a sec to properly cringe when [NAME] says why he got sent to the school. Whyyyyy would you *announce* that oh my [NAME]
I love it.
Same cfn as reddit tag? I'm curious to see this.
IMO there are quite a few jobs that are criminally underpaid, but that's just me.
Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I‚Äôll write home with pen and paper
Get out of my head.
Cheers mate.
Hey, it's working again! Somebody at YouTube must have given the server a whack, because suddenly the recommendations are making sense. I wonder what happened today.
I'm here with a devil axe and 34 Krit chance. And my killer axe just broke.
cause they want people to know there relvant again
The Grappler was fun to use, but way too strong.
People who claim others lie often deflect the question when asked for proof. Grow up
So it would seem
[NAME] Can we expect to see more tracer after brig nerfs? ü§î
"I agree, but people always respond with ""muh eugenics! Literally [NAME]! Human rights!"""
I have stated from the beginning that I do not believe that Abuse, Interrupted is a good resource for people in this subreddit.
Nailed it!!!
You‚Äôre missing my point.
LOL men don't have feelings ;)
Ah fuck.
Man I love this team. No I hate this team. No I love this team!
Sorry I meant the participants
He doesn‚Äôt use Gillette. Just lets that glorious neckbeard grow.
Hopefully you get a good bashing soon
Damn is it really?! Ah, that makes me love his performance even more
That was so disgusting. VWP
I would‚Äôve LOVED to be a part of something like this as a kid!!
Doing Gods work .
To drool on.
Why? I would rather the players get the money than the owners
Now? Look at what they did to rip the Black Panthers apart from the inside.
Cool I have a few friends that do the same I appreciate them being stories instead of direct messages
#THEY DON'T VOTE IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS, JUST LOCAL ONES *Takes a deep breath*
Talking about cats my lil Friend just jumped on the couch *pat pat from the nice people of reddit*
Also groin injury, he‚Äôd probably take the week off regardless. 
$20 too much
Our best hope is that [NAME] intends to outlast [NAME] and serve under President [NAME].
Yeah they‚Äôd probably want more than [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME], maybe [NAME] can finesse them too lol
And getup attack off ledge. All you need tbh
The last thing you see before entering Hell.
Now we just need to kill [NAME] if [NAME] wasn't saved to really even the odds with her, similarly to [NAME] with [NAME]. 
Whenever I leave my character in free roam I get an idle notification very quickly. Must have glitched.
Hey, you ever watch the sopranos before?
Perhaps you are right and the stereotype that ASD people are math savants may not be as true as I thought ü§î
I didn't think I could love [NAME] any more. Is there a central repository for all of these battles
Wow! Good for her! I‚Äôm so glad she was able to see through the bullshit!
It is crazy to me that there are even people in this sub that think [NAME] isn't worth his contract.
Yeah. That was my point.
Happy cake day!
Love pasta. Not a fan of cosmos. I‚Äôll take an aperol spritz though üòç
100% scam
An interesting point but do you know where Auto-trader were told the van would be when the photo shoot was booked. That may well explain your point.
Thank you!
Honestly, this has got to be the most reckless way to bully and harass a kid. Kids have a tendency to grow to their expectations
Meth is a hell of a drug.
I wish him good luck trying to get the video back but his chances are quite low. It's one man versus a corporate empire.
Wow I had no idea all of this transpired. Crazy!
This must be what you get angry about when you don‚Äôt have any actual problems in your life.
‚ÄúSo even if vaccination did cause autism...WHICH IT FUCKING DOESN‚ÄôT!‚Äù Pure genius.
I've always wondered how much of this stuff doesn't end up on the internet
That‚Äôs a bold move, [NAME]. Let‚Äôs see if it pays off. 
Not to assume things here but why would you gas yourself over [NAME], kid is a fucking monster
It boggles my mind every day how easily conspiracy theorist stuck their flag in Trumpland.
MmMm I love me some microplastics.
I love the fact nobody talks about boycotting the Times (owned by the same media group), because they know scousers don't read it anyway. üòÇ
He's not an island he has support and help some are powerful friends. I imagine he takes the fight to [NAME] after this
Even though I'm not the poster thanks for this, I had no idea it was a thing. I'm going to check it out.
I read these comments assuming the context was the Government. Actually it's probably accurate for both TWD and the Government.
As a furloughed fed, this does indeed lift my spirits. Thanks for putting this on my radar.
"That's why I said ""much"" instead of ""most"" ... 70 is still 5 over 65."
Good for them. I still don't believe a single word of it.
Maybe be nicer and people will hang out with you.
That's a classic. You have good taste.
Awesome shot dude!
Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times
Guess I stand corrected then, my diabetic friend must be similarly misinformed 
That literally doesn‚Äôt even look like her omg

He was so proud of it, too ...
self fulfilling prophecies are always quite fascinating
A million little things. I love it, but cheating arc within first couple episodes. 
That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry that happened.
>For those of us who stay, there may be more unhappiness than happiness. Probably the saddest thing I ever heard. 
Hell yeah!
Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.
But they did they say excited to bring their current roster to Columbus...
I wouldn‚Äôt worry, most United fans have never even been to Manchester. 
That's this whole sub lol
My landlord had one outside my apartment for a while...this went up in my window for a few days. LOL
Yeah but scary brown people. Ever thought of that libtard? /s ^just ^^in ^^^case
He's just showing off for the camera there.
For the love of all that is good get rid of these people already.
Now there are two of them!

I'm sure the two young sons of [NAME] are comforted by the fact that the cops involved didn't want to kill an unarmed man.
"What am I supposed to understand from the phrase ""1v1 fam, a duel""."
I love it when people delete their whiny comments and then try to reply with something snarky
It's better for the future to suck and draft top 5 than be mediocre and draft 12th?
Hellman's is owned by big pharma sheeple, they inject poisonous vaccines straight into sandwich spreads!
I solo climbed to Master as main DPS with 60hz. It really doesnt matter.
I heard [NAME] makes someone his bitch on a usual basis. Anyone remember how often?
Cinesphere and Trillium Park are both fantastic spots and I see absolutely zero reason to change them.

loved this one as a kid
I can't believe Pandora created scat. An icon.
Only when they have dirt underneath them, now that‚Äôs disgusting.
Maybne it dropped omg.
Thank god, you're right. At least this idiocy didn't stick around long.
NOT EVEN CLOSE!
Oh I see!
Are you willing to donate to local organizations or do you want to focus on national? What issues do you want addressed?
That makes sense. Thanks.!
We're entitled to express our opinion that OP's opinion is shit.
"Yes, which is why I hate the term ""ranked choice voting""."
Repost with a better title
It‚Äôs all the anger, it ages her terribly 
Every time you share this with someone you teach your body that you don't need to hide this.
Really wow, what a steal
No worries! I'll go through these when I have time. Just may take a few days here and there.
Now he isn't pulling enough troops out? He just can't win..
I hope you‚Äôre okay. I‚Äôm here to talk if you need someone

"Now someone mod danganronpa 2 so everytime [NAME] says hope its actually ""AHHH HAHA! Thats hot!"""
Nah, only [NAME] are cool for being bilingual.
She didn't believe that [NAME] left a Bomb. To [NAME] it could all be a trick to get her to come back.
I think its justified because that dude freaks me out. The less money the better.
I like Chick-Fil-A but I don't go because of their political stances against gay/trans people.
I miss my Shrek Ghrok :(
I mean they still managed to say [NAME].
>very unlikely Literally impossible
> I refuse to believe facts
Yes you can start working. Just use those bags, but don't bother with the prompt on the dashboard.
Yes, I dont trust people very much so I tend to push them away, and I feel like I dont have enough energy to keep up with people 
You‚Äôre right, 5 minutes won‚Äôt be enough, earlier could be 10 minutes. Weird how that works.

I resonate with this so strongly. Thank you for putting this feeling into words so succinctly.
Excellent location. When it‚Äôs finished it‚Äôll be spectacular around there.

Pick one. - Socialism can't work people human nature is intrinsically selfish. - We don't need taxes because people will be naturally charitable.
But the Hijab is mandated by (and therefore connected to) political Governments and political groups that otherwise do some pretty oppressive things.
Sorry man [NAME] doesnt care about hard working [NAME]. Sad
Singapore doesn‚Äôt lock up all drug users. They brutally go after the dealers.

There's no reason ever to get [NAME] breakfast tacos when you live in Austin.
He may be jealous that you were able to do so
This is horrible... One of my worst nightmares actually.
Man, [NAME] is a weirdo.
With [NAME] impersonating [NAME] after getting arrested yesterday, this makes it pretty clear who gave [NAME] that phrase.
[NAME] should have come back. I'm surprised you could get any worse than the s10 one but shit i was wrong.
I hope these young women change the church and not the other way around.
Fortnite is not a good game anymore smh my head

[NAME] please don‚Äôt come to the USA. We‚Äôd love to have you...but you don‚Äôt need to deal with this.

Once you love someone with a mental illness, you would do anything for that power to heal. 
I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
I wish. But sadly my job relies on other people so I just can't be the sole person

Darn. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. I honestly am out of ideas and I don't know what to do.
To be honest he doesn't have to be sorry for smoking weed. Your neighbor is a yuppy.

Looks like something you would see in a comedy movie.
All the best!
I never claimed it was a moral bad.
I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.

It‚Äôs all good man, I missed [NAME] too. I REALLY hope we get another dream sequence with him in EP4. 
They then went to a piano concert together. This conflict is amazing in it's twists and turns.

please report the physical and emotional abuse to the police so there is record of it. And get a lawyer ASAP.
There will *always* someone gaming the system. Always. I still donate food for the other 999 people that really need assistance to get over a tough time.
Literally all of them have said and done MUCH worse than anything [NAME] has.
Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]...
Thank [NAME] though! Imagine someone like that with kids... yikes
You're eating us out of house and home, garmfield.
Vincentown diner on 206. A lot of farm to table stuff, desserts are excellent, everything I‚Äôve had has been delicious. 
That‚Äôs the one!
I mean I'm no fan of the series either but who cares? It makes a lot of people happy.
he's a con artist. they're pretty good at making themselves sound smart and capable.
And they haven't done that either. You're speculating with no basis.
The fact that the passenger gives a thumbs up drives me crazy
My friends who do a lot of flirting could care less if some ditsy broad blows it out of proportion.
I would think they probably couldn‚Äôt take it if you tried
Lucky you, some people have all the love 
You joke but people would believe it!
I think you are missing: He's learned from the experiences and has stopped acting that way.
I pray the chains that make this life hard are broken by gods power and you are freer with each day!
Wow you could like hand out anarchist flyers while selling these balloons. Would probably attract a lot of people

Hoping to make it to Seattle soon. I‚Äôll make sure to reach out.

Thank you! And may [NAME] shine His love upon you!
That's so refreshing. Thanks a lot!

I don't believe they distribute to Austin.
I would highly recommend [NAME] ([NAME]) he is the great-grandson of [NAME]
DWIGHT, NEVER YELL AT THE CUSTOMERS
[NAME]! You made me the happiest girl that could eva be!
For me, she looks happy and nervous as well to meet to her future husband¬¥s family.
Downvote. These slippers cute as hell.
[NAME] is da man. A gangsta mathematician who had the guts to seduce the most beautiful Spartan woman of her time.
I report these every time they appear on the buy/swap/sell groups.
Been closeted for 25 years, I feel like it made me the man I am today. 
takes no time to copy/paste a press release
No I wish. They don't come to Texas very often.
Maybe but kids and social media and cellphones in classroom, and a pervasive culture that glorifies sports over education are ruining our education system. 
Sweden is projected to be a third world country within ten years.
Not in Tuscaloosa, it's been a looooong time since that happened (1926)
I met my partner online. It was romantic interest right away. No friendship period for us.

Fun fact: There are only 2,208 billionaires in the world

‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this morning in my head I kept saying let go of the resentment this is amazing
Aw it‚Äôs the same user who was scared of breast feeding lmao
Gotcha. I was married a few years before that, but you might have known my sister. She dated a guy in your branch named [NAME]
100% dead as in I'm 100% killing her myself if I get the chance.
How can he balance like that with those massive balls of steel he obviously has?
It‚Äôs selfish to not want to march with people who believe you‚Äôre termites and [NAME] killers?
Ahem. There are those who think that life Has nothing left to chance A host of holy horrors To direct our aimless dance
CNC is just the safe way to play out a rape fetish
We're pretty spoiled in Halifax.
They probably got de-funded. I need to support them.
Not for long!
That sounds awesome! Thanks for the reply!
‚ÄúI want to stay the night, but it‚Äôs late and my mom would worry since I didn‚Äôt tell her I was coming out‚Äù
Maybe its how he actually types ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Haha, imagine someone always looking amazingly fashionable, taking hours to dress 'down', trying to look casual.
That's what I'm speaking purely about. We can only speculate. And oh, yeah, still quality cringe.
And why does he shame women for choosing a beautiful person over an ugly guy lol?
Well, only the fringe dissipates into the ether. 
Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.
When religious freedom is limited, then you don't have religious freedom. Secularism is a religion, and trumps other religions in secular lands. 
is your dad very wealthy by any chance [NAME]
Organizational Change Manager and I fucking love it and have for 7 years. Still enjoy going to work every day.
"Can you make your flair ""Every other team in the metro"""

That‚Äôs Grandpa [NAME]. I stomp flaming bags with my boots
It‚Äôs news to meü§™
cant wait to go through a rebranded version of this pain again in college too
Devastating and true.
I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
If this is true 2020 is done. We won't have control of the presidency or Congress for decades.
Yeah level 3 armor was so overwhelming and felt like you had no chance against it unless the player was really bad or you had more concussion grenades
where did they even find that photo
Those are some pissed off lookin Nucks
It was [NAME], cm. Didn't have the best of games today.
More like you need ennemy jungle too dumber/weaker than u. But at equal skills, when player know how to play, its a troll pick.
Nobody traveled from Ahch-To to Cantonica or vice versa iirc, so this doesn't make a lot of sense...?
As will myself and everyone else who is able to leaving the poorest to fend for themselves. Or we revolt like the [NAME]. Edit: grammar
That moment when you turn your head, trying to see what is happening 2mm off camera...
Need a big lead and we have [NAME] shoot 3s and [NAME] waiting for the rebound!
Lmaoo a team full of [NAME] blunders, sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs sabotage from the man above 
Who the fuck leaves a hot iron on the couch
Can you skip second book without damaging the whole series?
The twist is that is that it was all a [NAME] fever dream the whole time.
Absolutely ripping for that show. Really excited to see what they play!

Look at [NAME] and you should be good, he has a career like 58% GB rate 
this is a GANGSTER-ASS revelation!!!!. thanks mr. [NAME]!
Sure that makes a gal feel safe, the idea of being with three males with weapons in an abandoned building. How romantic! 
How do you think she got the job?
Wow that's just like when I sing it
Doesn‚Äôt offend me, I just don‚Äôt like looking at it. 
I'm all for strong lady friendships.
I just hope [NAME] doesn't lose hope. Dudes got a great heart. But knowing our organization...
Pls come back
Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.
That's what I thought (landlord myself). Even if you rent a room to someone, still that's a bit extreme.
I agree, I love acdc, I just don't love the comments on their songs cause so many of them are dumb lmao
It is a kayak
"My sister and cousin got one. I'll probably say ""not even with a gun to my head"" if I get one."
Shithole universe i mean.
That one is pretty obvious
You're right, I should stop being so worried about other people. Family is forever.
UNLIMITED POWER!
I'm so effin' proud of you! You handled it beautifully!
Thank you so much for sharing this... really opened my mind.
Yeah, they have uniforms and everything. It‚Äôs really great.
Thank you [NAME]
I live in Raleigh and all the Canes fans I know love it. So the players love it and the fans love it. Everyone else can chill
I've never been this sad in my life!
He's rolled his eyes at least 3 or 4 times by now.
Wow, the cropping on this shitpost is as bad as it gets.
Damn democrats, if they think they're caring for the children, why don't they just change the weather then, never thought about that one. 
We're all [NAME] fans in our hearts
[NAME] is waaaaaaaay smaller than him haha. Although I'm sure they equally love steak
It gave me a laugh. xD
At least the bike was lighter than you ... poor cr50
I just hope the Cavs don‚Äôt get the 1st pick fuck them
She's doing so good!!! I'm rooting for her hardcore!! I like her.
"Gotta love how ""QUESTIONING"" is front and center in the list of things these warriors for [NAME] consider brainwashing."
Lol love that [NAME] and [NAME] are both [NAME]. And [NAME] as [NAME] is best choice. Should have brought puddy in though. Hah
Let me go you fiend.
Man i was so sad when i found out vodka had calories
[NAME] damn it

This version of mass destruction is by far my favorite
Shes 43 with 4 kids. That's so far past the wall it's not funny.

Let's hope he doesn't change his mind.
Cheers, guys! We are never drinking alone when we are here! But in person, I love drinking alone. 
Alright, see ya man
You think 60% is shafting anyone? I think Tellius is sub 20%.
I tip my invisible hat anytime I drive past this dealership. What an unfortunate surname.
Maybe he's just pretending to be.
Interesting I‚Äôve never met any one IRL that met that way. Guess there must be some people meeting that way üòÄ
We did it [NAME], we stopped racism
I love that your drinking that out a tumbler
It tore off lol. The bracket isn‚Äôt installed on delivery.

hahaha. best response I've seen in a few days
Girls dog got bored fairly quickly.
It's nice to have dreams.
Well...to be fair then. :)
Probably more like she identified [NAME]. You have no proof she saw [NAME] so stop being fake and acting like you know what she saw.
Beat my second wife cuz obviously she put the evil eye on my first wife
It could be worse. We could get [NAME] or that Philly traitor [NAME] back.
She doesn‚Äôt have to be added to the game for her to be significant, [NAME] was just an extreme example.
You're probably right and how terrible of them, if so. Poor [NAME].
Wait... so you do or don't have Cole Madison news? I heard he became a [NAME] and he's living in Thailand.
Is that Riverside, CA? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm from! Sadly I was barely a teen in 1993-first time I saw them was Dec. 1996
Is there something I'm missing here? I don't see the pun.
Still love [NAME]. Gave his heart to the Broncos for many years. Hope he can go out and win himself another ring this year.
You‚Äôve got to be shitting me?
I tried to send this to a friend but [NAME] knocked it away.
I wonder if truly might be work stress. He works long hours at a prestigious law firm. I need to five him more credit.
Woot woot!
Lmao how many of these posts will we get before people realize its satire.
Most people buy them new because the risk of them being involved in some sort of accident is just too high.
Do something you‚Äôll love and you‚Äôll never work a day in your life? Huh, strange
anyone who tells u what to do is a fascist
A team has to be at least 3 people, right? So 500/3 = $167 a week. Baller CEO status
Supposedly friend's wife is like this. I don't get it at all.
Wow either [NAME] misspoke or I didn't hear correctly. I swear he said chainsaw, that is totally different from knife or cooking accident.
It is an absolutely horrible ultimate I agree after 400 hours on doom I still hate it
Bro, pay attention. I know you guys aren't known for that, but this is not a centrist sub. For [NAME] sake read for one
I strongly agree
Omg that‚Äôs a perfect idea! I obviously want to avoid the stalker thing but I do love basketball and understand it so this seems possible
The super bowl isnt played in march my man
Says who?
Another day, another Newsweek article reporting what some commentator said on TV.
No no I‚Äôm repeating it because I absolutely love the descriptor! It made me crack up.
Shut yer mouth libtard and get yer MAGA on! /s
Yes the ammo health thing really is a chore. Too much realism. we want have some fun in a realistic setting, not a simulator. 
Subscribed to sjwstories, thanks for informing me about that one!
Maybe the solution for global warming is not hitting the most vulnerable ones, but aiming for measures that reduce the impact of the big polluters
Happy cake day!
You guys are heading toward healing, that's amazing.. Is it possible that you are wishes on true healing 
Love the alliteration here.
This is the first time I'm seeing this. This definitely what I would call toxic masculinity.
I got offered a couple of batches. They weren't 100% terrible but I feel like they could've been better so I didn't take them.
2009. What a year to be a 10 year old
gross.
Life is just an endless series of disappointments and no one gets out of here alive.
That face in 0:18. That's the face of happiness
Your description fits the type of SB I prefer. I don't see short hair as a negative.
[NAME] this is so true, sometimes i will remember it like 5 years later and still regret it
Every single time
SHIT. I just gave my son some Skittles. Lemme edit that right quick LOL
> the ruts laid out for you by the people who raised you I like that. It's the perfect imagery.
My gym coach used to make a buch of two pack jokes. This was before [NAME] died so it was alot funnier
*lol whats a calculator isnt that a person that calculates why would they have letters on them*
Wow!!!
I wonder if the paintings he did on Brooklyn 99 were actually his.
No problem. I'm happy to know it's not what you meant.
someone woke up on the wrong side of the sleeping bag
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
Me too. They just slow everything down.
Is anyone familiar with what the post was about? Im guessing it was on the NYC hate crime?
I'm accusing you of framing [NAME] for murder. Where are your records?
Lol! Taxes are where the soul goes to die. Good luck, man! Get that degree and run far away!
Good to see [NAME] getting some love.
What is the reason you 2 have only been on 1 date in a whole year? Why cant you just 'see' each other in person?
It‚Äôs pretty old. [NAME] did it.
Those things still haunt my dreams to this day.
I think if you're sending and receiving texts longer than 10 words your marriage is doomed.
heyyy that‚Äôs my birthday as well!
I find this extremely hard to believe. Living abroad is hard, and most people can hardly fathom leaving the USA, let alone living outside it.
But how's the breathing through the nose. That's the important question. Can he nail it?
Yeah I did think that was the case, thank you! So excited to see my new Capstan!
Hopefully once [NAME] comes back, ZAR has earned a spot on the 2nd line LW.
tell him i love him
My husband is the same way. His mother would dose them daily to keep her 4 children calm.
That is subjective, it just increased my patience hence, it made me patient. As if I already wasn't.
At first glance I thought he was just being a good citizen and trying to perform CPR on the poor guy
this is the type of high level discussion I come to this sub for!
That's how I feel every time someone wants me to hold their baby.
I don't even understand stuff is going on, I just laugh and hope it's at the right time. 
I've grown to love this idea the more I think about it. It'd be amazing if it came down to [NAME] and [NAME] as the final two
Thank you for this video
This is obviously ironic
His smile is so damn creepy
You go home now
But thats for [NAME] and our secret getaway plan to escape to a better life, not this one. Lol
#25 on the floor #1 in my heart
Me thinks you‚Äôre responding to the wrong dude. My original comment couldn‚Äôt have beeen more drenched in irony.
Maybe divorce is a little extreme but I really dont know how to Express my feelings, and she doesn't get that
I sure hope by all falls down you mean all mine and by the workout plan you're talking about the skit and not the song
This team doesn‚Äôt deserve to go the playoffs. Only [NAME] deserves to go. Is that possible?
Yeah I'll probably do some baking with it! I might also like it better after a while, I was just very surprised today üòÇ
BF1 was heaven
Last time I tried to post, my post was deleted because I didn't have enough karma, wasn't even that long ago...
In hindsight, yeah, but we had a healthy [NAME] at that point.
Manlets unite!
RemindMe! 10 hours
I like how because it‚Äôs on topic you assume everyone involved is making it their entire being. Lmao.
A long term relationship with pizza? Wow talk about accurate!
Facts no fiction

Thank you so much for the help üòä
a weird way to spell Boys Don‚Äôt Turbo Grafx 16
Cool shot. Super wide angle, multi shot?
We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous
Me too thanks!
I wonder what was more painful, the stitches or the humiliation.
I was at the game at there was a huge Laker fandom there. It felt almost like an away game.
Kill me, [NAME] 
Im so glad they him a burial.
Besides, Canada is extremely choosy about the kind of people they allow in.
[NAME] dirty talk really just Doesnt Work for me. Sounds silly at the best of times.
Oh really. Go ahead and try to reason with an [RELIGION] government that their power should be limited. Good luck.
"Only ever attracted to other non binaries? Homo simply means ""same"", so for a nonbinary, same would mean nonbinary"
Ah yes, the poison. The worst part of any poisoning. 
I told you you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs silly anyone would care about foreign intelligence attempting to influence elections. What a silly joke.
I can always make new friends because I'm charismatic, but I still really care about them.
I don't think you could actually find something that's *unambiguously* racist. That's just how dog whistles work.
Similar but I don't think identical to this
Globalism is cancer, long live the sovereign nation!
She should kick him out... next best thing from abortion.
this, they will find a way. we screwed over my entire street for an hour when I got my new fridge..
Maybe she misheard thirteen as thirty. It's a possibility.
Have you pulled an updated Batch Guidance sheet? If your tossing a lot of coffee out, it sounds like you might be brewing too much.
What's that like? Like what's the thought process? I dunno. I know what's a weird question..i just can't imagine
Thats too funny
i think you misunderstood my comment. [NAME] over [NAME] any day
1.0mg is a high dose. My husband is an insomniac and can't take that dose without nightmares.
Zionism is the ISIS of [RELIGION]. Brainwashed idiots like ISIS.
That trade turned out to be a complete disaster for us. Too bad.
PC! Utah>Colorado
I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street.
Glad we aren't all like you , the world would have sucked
[NAME] isn't really that bad, he's also a cheaper option who [NAME] trusts.
This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
I was once nearly run over by a moped that was doing 60 MPH in a parking lot. Your comment reminded me of that.
Explain to me why you‚Äôre not attracted to black men without making broad generalizations about their physical attributes or personalities.
You're right. I totally forgot about [NAME].
All seasons premise
That is genius.
[NAME] as a coach. That definitely doesn't make me feel old.
SO MUCH.
I wouldn't say age would stop it just lessen the affect of it but probably start to notice it around mid to late 30's.
Thanks! You too!
It's right up there with sites trying sell you gold for the coming apocalypse
The shocking thing about this all is that she seems to be British born. I'd expect this from immigrants, not those born in the UK.
"I wheezed at hope you just named her ""girl"", absolutely straight for the jugular"
[NAME] was better at converting 3rd and 5+ than 3rd and <5 before his injury in 2015.
This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would leave on my Facebook post.
"I was more responding to the ""Michigan will be fighting against that all year."" In two weeks, there's no preseason weight at all. "
That song was epic live
This‚Äôll get [NAME] pumped to come over!
Here we go, ya'll ready for WW3...this time we're the baddies! 
Actually my biggest question is why people are working if they aren't getting paid
*thinks about all of those hours on GTA* [chuckles] I‚Äôm in danger
You have plenty of time. Forget about women for now. Focus on improving your status by getting a good education.
Your art is really beautiful dude, it could straight up be in a museum 
Also the world is round.
EB GAMES STILL EXIST there?
I'm glad we have a place we can come to when we have doubts. Thank you so much.
Oh boy lol
r/UpLiftingNews Edit: I just got banned for posting this there.
Really? Thanks for the correction.
are u ugly?
That crowd reaction for dirk at the end. What a legend
Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
Use it to your advantage. You will figure out a way. Just get your self esteem up real quick.
If someone posts it I would need some hard fuckin proof that it‚Äôs actually a [NAME] pick
That's what everyone says every start of the season
Is this not standard practice among many animal charities around the world? Not something that any of them like to put front and center.
Cute and acts like a puppy but sexy at the same time. Totally exists btw
[NAME], I'm excited to watch your journey and hope you have massive success! 
YeH, I‚Äôm trying to inquire about this.
Love u too booboo
Debs a bitch
Sounds awesome!
If only someone would love the septuple-PhD in the galaxy for her mind.lol
I'm just curious, all those people who blamed you for his infidelity, what are they saying now?
Good viral marketing attempt [NAME]!
Now that took serious skill and training. 3 warnings in half a second, all while deflecting the aim of the aggressor and counter-firing.
Get a handkerchief, ridiculously helpful.
Congrats dude!
They‚Äôre not pissed off to the point where they‚Äôre actually going anywhere else, and that‚Äôs just crunching numbers.
I want an autographed copy of this, framed and on my wall. 
Son: I can't believe you were in i-wreck
No at that point you‚Äôre a POS, or just have horrible taste in women lol 
Long arm is an amazing ganking tool (one of the best) with many possible one-shot ganks.
Lol‚Äôd at your flair
Why was this deleted?
Think about it as a normal match then be confident in your play.
And queuing up to rewatch that series
"Anyone else feel like this should have ended, ""Enjoy the ride and there's a Pimento Taco--a Pimentaco--in the glove box?"""
It's amazing that some people think that [RELIGION] will prevent all of this from happening.
I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a hell or heaven.
AND HIS FATHER WAS A DRACULA
I see, thanks for the clarification.
The best LGBTQ+ FILM i have seen in years.

One more thing don't try to like eavesdrop or anything just kinda bring it up organically
I want to SO bad
What‚Äôs so bad about this again? I mean he‚Äôs right for the most part.
Thank you üòÅ
mind = blown
"Well this beats the whole ""[NAME] tried to convince the front office to take [NAME] at 1"" narrative"
I don‚Äôt know exactly what this entails but I‚Äôm all for it man
The sad thing is, relatively speaking these are actually pretty good living conditions. Check out Harris Ranch.
I do: PUT SOME CLOTHES ON
[NAME] people. Just vaccinate your overgrown sperm cells and people won't have to die.
Well that's good. Now, where am I?
It's understandable to be in so much pain and agony after losing a child. If I may ask, was this your first baby?
Hmmmmm. I'll have to go pay that sub a visit.
Probably smashed his oil pan too, I'd give that car 3 miles to live.
Out of control by darude. Just get carried away by the sounds man
That was it! Thank you
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS
Happy cake day!
I am glad your okay.
My 1 year old ate TWENTY TWO broccoli tots for lunch. And he still wanted a cookie afterwards. Like...what?!
I used to live in Brule,about an hour east of Jasper. Look into the black cat ranch!
chuck cheese is for kids. let them run wild. Applebees they should throw out the parents if they cant control the kids
Lol maybe he is not but I think my point still stands üòÑ
The best for a reason.
It's not you, Taco Bell is grade D racoon meat and isn't fit for human consumption.
I got confused for a second and thought why would you pay for your ex's trip
I believe that the heart does go on
Thank you! I suddenly see the benefits of Fahrenheit.
It's clear for me that you've never been even close to a brazillian suburb. /s
I like it when a sub's name matches what I say when I see its content.
Honestly I‚Äôve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
Nervously laughs in anxiety
Who hurt you
It's great.
i have noticed i am getting leg pains & backpain after day 1 of fapping and feeling powerless and unmotivated
Great to see [NAME] back on the court
if he would only have any marketable skills, alas I think he is going to serve hard time
Wanna trade lives? I'd gladly take normal height with hair and have the same experience.
I know, don't worry ;) 
"""what you want"" is a populated, limited set, and thus discrete."
That's the spirit
No. Spend all of it ASAP. Spend the evidence so you can get rid of it quickly and safely while also still being able to buy shit!
Nice try, bot!
Yeah I've heard that every store is very different. I'm sorry to hear you don't like your current situation. :(
I prefer buying the winner chests and holding on to the Godlike chests until a skin I want is in it.
Hard. Social anxiety/general fear/uggoness kept me from actually getting dates and i was extremely awkward when I finally stopped anxie-puking to actually go on the date.
If you absolutely can't find a copy of the book - private message me.
[NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
Send everything through lawyers. Go no contact as soon as possible.
Feels good to be a Nets fan right now
Is that how you handle things in Old Metairie? Cause that's definitely not how things were handled in NYC.
This is awesome. I have so much junk in my head that I need to address the way you describe. Thanks for sharing.
I CAN DOWNLOAD ADS BUT NOT THE THING ITSELF FFS
To be fair, we‚Äôre still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though. 
Maybe it's fantasy.....I just feel like the stock for a lot of these Ducks is reallllll low right now
You misspelled Eastern Russia
Lol at the self-own of thinking ‚Äúliterally‚Äù is a ‚Äúbig word‚Äù, with a cherry of being too stupid to understand the context on top.
Very disappointed to find out that you can‚Äôt play NCAA football on PS4. Wack.
im trying to but my depression gets the better of me i have my good days and bad days
I found some very interesting things on the mind shock podcasts about questions I had. Enjoy the digging in the reddit hole.
That's literally the science of it.
He‚Äôs so eager to please! This trait in dogs is so endearing.
Girl YES. My kindergarten come back Tuesday, and I‚Äôm hoping they remember my name and how to hold a pencil.
Plus the idea of a choose your own adventure movie is absolutely exciting and brings more chances to go back through
Super cool to see
By your logic the AIDS epidemic must mean HIV contributes to the well being of people who have it.
442 is how many goals we're scoring today
This is fantastic! What an incredible gesture. Given the current fears British [NAME] are currently living under, this is a very welcome bit of news.
We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it. 
that's so wholesome üíú
Source? Wouldn't doubt it's possible though games like BDO can get pretty nuts with whales.
Holy shit they‚Äôre already in the bonus
Unfortunately not:
It's simple, I asked, and she lied.
Macs Local Eats is just the best. I don't know what else to say.
I came here to see this. Never disappointed in reddit
Technology is amazing. Now we can SEE how new plagues start. Just incredible.
SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
Who needs sciences. It's most fake news they peddle in anyways...
Makes me wish we had a hero that could slow time like the tested Lucio Ult people were talking about in here.
The UN said the election was a sham. The man is causing death destruction and starvation. Your morals are completely and utterly fucked.
Fuck the rangers
Orange man funny but concerning
I know so I also make a joke about how we‚Äôre going to give bell so much money that we‚Äôll be in the negative for cap
Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated.
I have a religious friend who i agreed with early on that we could make fun of each other's beliefs/lack of. We're still best friends :)
Dude take the medicine. It helps.
He gives political answers to political questions. He's still interacting with the public unfiltered and I can't imagine any CPC Prime Minister ever doing similar.
Let‚Äôs not tempt fate...injuries report to spring training too.
Funny. He said the same thing to me. I don‚Äôt even have a daughter.
food pranks really irk me üòî
Yeah, there are a lot of things this sub hates.
> She fucked my bumper up and I will forever hate her And her insurance didn't repair it because???
But the keeper wasnt.
> i dont want people to have bad lifes. Exactly, but apparently many people not only admit this but gloat about it.
Wow you're so moral you've changed my outlook on remainers
this guy /u/EightRoundsRapid is sending me nude dm's even though he knows i'm underage, what do i do?
Disgusting trash feminazis, fuck your hijab
One. We are unlikely to survive long enough to make it to our second kill.
Was my friends family... They had the wrong address, you're sick dude. 
Lol thank god someone else thinks this. There's nothing overly premium or innovative about the Elite controller.
Paid model. She's a paid model and it's probably in her contract to drop her professional Instagram handle.
Plutocrats love Wealthcare.
Sorry for your loss üò£
‚ÄúBigotry is when you disagree with me, and the more you disagree the more bigotryer it is‚Äù -[NAME]
Fair play, thanks for educating me üòä
What the fuck? Really? That‚Äôs horrible. That‚Äôs probably illegal. If it isn‚Äôt, it should be.
You always listen to Pizza! ... especially pizza with pineapple on it!
[NAME] has noted your transgression. Punishment is forthcoming. Please stand by.
I think womens bodies range widely.. Water, silicone, coconut oil, amounts and frequency needed.. I think these things are largely independent of the quality of arousal..
Caring too much
i don't usually 'wall of text' posts but i'm glad i made your post an exception. thank you, it brought tears to my eyes.
Haunt her forever...
Stop trying and just do it. Then decide if it‚Äôs worth the effort. Otherwise this is just envy.
Ya missed a clue there, Guess it never hit ya!
I guess it‚Äôs no surprise that [NAME] really was [NAME] Destenay.
Man I love Canadaüá®üá¶
I'm just gonna take this as a metaphor for idiot units.
Shoot i posted this in the wrong place. Here you are several sources. Happened last summer.
Because what you're doing is disgusting and an insult to humanity.
Gee I wish.
I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
Yeah I live in Philadelphia. I also get told I look 14 constantly so I haven‚Äôt bothered trying to even get in hah
Embrace the feels my friend. Glad you found happiness even if it is fleeting.
She was carrying all my burdens >:((
Oh definitely. When you work for the gov't you root for the party looking to expand it. Maybe that's how you'll get a raise right?
He looks so young, always thought he was older than me.
Not worth it. My family is the same way. I am scapegoat. I cut them all off and I have never been happier or more at peace
There is going to be an adjustment period at first for sure, but [NAME] would definitely help our defense.
I actually currently have a girlfriend and I love her. It's just that those past situations gave me trust issues for life I guess.
People will go mental hoarding food, so you should be hoarding food, not like those idiots that panic. I'm confused.
Sometimes, I feel bad if I don't every now and then. I mostly talk with her on SC/IG tho. 
I think the longer the ass hair is the less I want it on my desk
And their cats. IT loves kittens.
Yeah, they're on whatever the opposite of a roll is today. 
What the fuck? Why would you ever say that? Downvoting you smfh edit
Wow, out of all of that, only one person mentioned helping parents because they loved their parents. SAD.

[NAME] kid got flyer shoes than the rest of us
It seems you might be right. I found this
[NAME] was a great coach
This is the greatest analogy
Your spine is so shiny! Good for you!
The fact that people STILL believe this after 5 years is mind boggling to me..
Being physically attractive üòí
Oh that's disgusting, this man should be sent to priso- ohh, it's America, ok then, feel free. 
I hope [NAME] does get a new devil trigger. I‚Äôm sorry but seeing the same one repeatedly has gotten old.
See [NAME] this is the problem, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre talking about cutting people in half or halving the population
I live in that District. I vote [NAME], watch her kicked [NAME] ass(4 time). She's got this.
Listen to only [RELIGION] music.
oh i knew that
Why?..... just.. why?
I work 12 hour shifts, and agree. Tea is life-saving.
We all love our childbrain president and all the wonderful things he‚Äôs doing for ~~white~~ American people.
I enjoy the harsh throat hit, reminds me of cigs. Edit: Mango is still my favorite though.
Thanks bot! The water looks so weird now
Looks like pretty much any Donkeys fan.
Lmao servers in America make like $2 an hour with no tips.
Enjoy friend.
Oh yeah. I love stepping out of the tub and putting my wet foot on COLD TILE. More like thanks I love this
Lmao there referring to what [NAME] said in episode 3 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
All he's getting from that experience is the opportunity to pay a fine to the gubment.
you didn't win fast enough and it's already mana 10? guess who deserved that bolt right in his face
Hi, everyone! This is my 13 minute action/comedy short film, JUICY! I hope you all enjoy! Feedback is welcome. 
IANL I have never thought twice about doing a little extra shoveling to help a neighbor. Can't imagine that it could be illegal.
Jokes on you I have one of those fancy electric toothbrush stands!
oh ok, i'll pass that on to him thanks :)
Taking the SEPTA from West Trenton can put someone in Philly and it's suburbs as well.
That's incredible. There was 3000 last I checked just over 2 years ago.
Pdx sliders. I never had stanich‚Äôs unfortunately but pdx sliders has some delicious greasy burgers.
Yup, my greatest fear realized.
I would never stay at a hotel that had people ringing a bell at the bar nonstop. Not to mention the gong
Just recked him, totally and utterly. 
I‚Äôll try to follow your advice. Thank you very much for your kind answer and your prayer. I‚Äôll pray for you too.
Have a little faith [NAME] ü§†
So his beef is about Footnote 1?
I'd rather [NAME] take the fight at this point, [NAME] looks ready to red mist
Meanwhile, in a certain discord
If he does still pull through on the appointment, he might be someone to schedule more with... Sorry bout your eye... Hope feel better soon...
I always move back and always regret it.
lol back in the day before the rise of BitTorrent, Russian ISPs used to run DC (DirectConnect) hubs
Yeah, however you spell it - I don‚Äôt play with them 
It depends on who you ask. i didnt downvote you, im answering now
I dont even know what that is lmao
It depends, what state are you in? 
I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ‚òπÔ∏è
I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
It's the issue with a lot of 'activists' who think all's they have to do is exist.
The jerk store called. They're running out of YOU!
This is probably a bit buried, but it‚Äôs very informative: thank you for taking the time to write it!
Cant wait to draft my man early to mid second round next year. If I'm drafting late first I might really go wr/wr
I kinda thought that's what you had meant. I'm a simple man.
Damn...perspective is good, Haha. Then again [NAME], that's some awesome architecture. Early 1900s?
I agree about that hill and visibility. Why they put that Starbucks in a poorly accessed place is beyond me.
I always described it as, ‚Äúthe trashiest bar in Detroit‚Äù
Imagine the smell of burning those pages
Don't forget the awkward tomboys.
Amazing story. Thank you for your service
Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
Non-stop fun.
I get hard in the morning from just standing up and my body not knowing where to put the blood. But any other time of day its always sexual
This is very helpful, I'll dive into these links thanks
His name has already been released. Just can't post it here.
What's the song name?
I like to think [NAME] is finishing the school year before coming back home.
i think u mean symfuhny lol
140 lb man. I could stand on it no problem. Jumping off would not be wise. Clearly.
Hahah I do live in Montreal, and you‚Äôre right. [NAME] damn it has been cold this week. 
I never heard much detailed discussion at church, mostly general references to them.
Also available on Spotify and Apple Music. Any feedback would be hugely appreciated!
Bye, dude.
What's the name of it? I googled Anker and there are several, but I want an included SD lol
I feel bad for these guys. I'd like to be able to help ex-mos in trouble.
Similarly to how they all claim to never read it but they're always reacting to what's said in the comments lol
With him though you're supposed to be attracted to him because that's how he was able to kill so many women
Lmao I love how no one replied to say you‚Äôre wrong but you had -1 upvotes
Oh... welp. üòë
This is a good step. Refusing to vaccinate your kids should be considered child abuse.
He should get some help from [NAME]
I hope they don't do that just to please pissed off fans who want everything to be clich√©.
yes how does it feel being one of them
Dems can end this. They chose not to.
One of the reasons im not straight üòÇüòÇ
"Lol ""Weapons grade weed"", I love it"
"Lived in a suburb of San Antonio, never experienced anything close to ""prejudice/racism/difficulties."""
Likely frostbite advisory weather.
Good meme, but unfortunately the pic is fake. 
Mr. [NAME], I don't feel so good...
Of course you don't think it's relevant. Your empathy for human life is tentative at best.
I‚Äôm a big Spider-Man fan and this looks terrible compared to Spider-verse and the PS4 game.
Sage advice. Just noticed your reply now! Thank you.
That's far more expensive than, you know, recycling it...
This is why you play runescape as a kid, it teaches how to trust no one that offers free rune plate trimming
Yikes that's cringe
All sounds possible except the key, I can't see how it was missed in the first search. 
But she can shoot someone in the back of the head and be held responsible for it.
When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...
Attention Bajoran Workers: Your videos our now ours.
You‚Äôre mixed up little buddy.
yikes I am not reading that, the napkins are over there sir, have a nice day
Applied Math lol.
I hope Thier friends now
Is [NAME] dating the woman she lives with? Not my business but enquiring minds want to know
i‚Äôd put forth that lots of people ACTIVELY DISLIKE dating and like being in relationships, so this wouldn‚Äôt help at all 
Did that with an oven pizza at 3am in my underwear. Got burns all over my stomach
Maybe a wall of traffic.
"Sorry, ""semi"". Happy?"
Thats pretty sweet.
Cheers man, will be taking it easy for sure. 
Please! She‚Äôs my #1 choice. The rare mix of super likeable and hypercompetent. Like [NAME] mixed with [NAME].
What‚Äôs not true, exactly? That population differences affect influence? That politicians know where their voters are and play to those strengths? 
i mean.... i do and all. but the automatic assumption was still a zinger.
That kill was beautiful
If being tired doesn‚Äôt work. Ask for a BJ
It's such a lol watching them trying to desperately rationalise their literalism.
Wouldn't the powder be derived from the crystalline MDMA?
I'm two weeks in, hope your right, I'm loving the game right now
He is a right click bot now lol, but seriously you do the same but with worse mobility.
Show down there heretic. You obviously meant to say: Unquestionable truth, any diversion from what seems to be true only comes from our own limitations. /s
Commentator on my stream saying the the clearing header was from [NAME]. Wasn't that [NAME]?
I can do the very first part, where he first jumps.
I didn't know [NAME] was in a j rock band
The Cavs didn‚Äôt even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
Eff your video - love Canada üá®üá¶ Stupid geolock
I like you both.
I wish they let him do the quatrains once a week during the NFL season.
you can please some of the people, some of the time, but you can't please all of the people, all of the time...
And a happy holiday to you.
Yeah, but ask how many people know who [NAME] is and how many people know who [NAME] is.
See her recent article in The Atlantic, in addition to what the other person who responded to you said.
"I loved the first single from BO so hopefully the entire album will be good. And has more effort into it than ""WHERE ARE THE JOKES"""
-_- GOOD FOR YOU.
You sure? They seem so much brighter on screen lol
> always ahead of everyone else!
I‚Äôm here,it‚Äôs tough but I‚Äôm here.
NOBODY TELL HIM
I've always loved [NAME] just saying are we all forgetting he literally won rookie of the year I know it was against no competition but still.
It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.
Ooh wrong answer, but you'll have another chance to win 10,000 dollars in the lighting round! Will be right back after these messages.
Sexy Unique Podcast (SUP) for all your VPR needs!
There kinda funny
This is what I always do.. is this not normal?
I mean, she could still be related to Palpatine or something. I mean, who knows they're kinda making it all up as they go along.
As much as I‚Äôd love [NAME] to be gone, i know they never would 
If we're able to continue picking off the most corporately-funded candidates, reps will naturally move left and we won't be faced with the ever-rightward creep.
We really need to stick to having helpful titles or a quick tldr.
I think I should try this. Thanks, OP.
Op give us a damn tldw
Lol, same! Except that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder
[NAME] these are hideous
I'm a doctor. The doctor examining him with severe back pain after an injury should test for sensibility, muscle strength, and reflexes at least.
Late 60's. I am old.
I still think hating [NAME] isn't a good move for them. Could turn those undocumented [NAME] into undocumented [NAME].
We riot if he doesn‚Äôt get it!
Oh god no!!! I was gonna get some shipped out to save you some money. Never mind.
Yes - sometimes I see amazingly detailed little faces. It's so weird.
Pretty poor shots mostly. Couple of great saves from [NAME] though.
The top half of the dress looks perfect. It‚Äôs the bottom that‚Äôs bad.
One of my 56 favourites
This might be the worst FO in Orlando magic history
He said ‚ÄúGuess he didn‚Äôt get the victory [NAME] :(‚Äú
That's the impression I've always had, but man the owner gets snippy if you disagree on your review!
If you don't think MAGA hats are associated with racism then you've got your head stuck in the sand.
So nice of everyone to welcome [NAME] to his rehab like this.
Homing pigeons make the best SOs
Leave [NAME] or [NAME], only one of em.. replace one with maybe [NAME]
Seeing this kind of vulnerability makes me appreciate her music.
They never seem to think this when the police arrive, with their guns, to end a terrible situation. 
Look at that thing...could tear you to shreds
I was justing humming Spin Light to myself before picking up my phone amd seeing this meme. Deja is such a classic, maybe my all time favorite album
Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool.
I love this! Wish I lived in the city!
I laughed way harder then i shouldve
I.. love arby's..
Yes but my point is [NAME] raping [NAME] makes more sense if she gives birth to [NAME] and [NAME], not [NAME].
I‚Äôve never cringed so hard
yes i did, thanks for explaining
I think this guy or gal is the official 2018/2019 Winter Season Dibs Champion
[NAME] sure are afraid of brown women.
Oh, did they innovate anything I would recognize with their obscenely large financial investments? :):):):)
"When he said, ""IT'S CALLED RESPECT"" and gritted through his teeth-- wow, he is just waiting to let his hands fly."
So in other words, he wooooshed
MORE LIKE [NAME]
I picked it so it forced me to stay anonymous.
[NAME] definitely needs to be on the left side he has such a great shot that he's perfect as a [NAME] type player on the powerplay.
This is a great segment.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything sad about how many people are attending from their country, but I am doubtful of their prospects!
I think I saw it but I can't remember now. =/

Fag breaks and a boozer within falling distance is a must.
Good for you!
New year home boy. You can still change. If not, 2020 is your time to shine boiii
[NAME] and others claim he was boxed in and had to call it. I think it was a mix of naivety, cockiness and flippancy. 
Yes, it's great! What I really love watching them play school on the playground.
This is a very cursed lineup
"He should say ""Rise up my comrades"" and he would be complete"
Im so hungry now! Damn this sub! I love it!
Funny looking bats.
[NAME] fucking [NAME]. You'd think strangling someone until they're unconscious would be *attempted murder,* not just second degree assault.
I don‚Äôt know about shatting myself but I would have been _shocked_ for sure.
Please be [NAME]. I like [NAME], for the record. But I'm def willing to part ways with him. 
209 comments and we don‚Äôt get to read any? All that good pasta advice going to waste. Shame.
Reports of a small fire or a transformer that blew. Nothing that I‚Äôve seen has confirmed either though.
Is this worth watching? It comes off like its glorifying the guy and kinda puffy.
what's a friend
If you were charged it is most likely due to poor articulacy/communication skills
he‚Äôs not happy with me
Yeah you're right, I mistyped it. Should have said after 1st and after the 2nd. There's none after the 3rd.
Chicken and the egg argument. Gun companies don't donate to [NAME] *because* they have gun control on their platform. This goes back decades mind you.
Thanks, obviously I didn't put my best foot forward here, but we are chemistry sets that are designed for certain activities etc.
Me and my best friend both are..
As much fun as I've had yanking their chains, does anyone know the background behind these particular scam calls? I've gotten several of them lately.
i‚Äôm so proud of you!! good job dude!! :)
My favourite food is anything I didn't have to cook myself.
Better ye, make some Pho and use lots of sriracha. Things will definitely get heated.
Should be Colt Wesley Small Johnson
So happy to see [NAME] regaining his form... we had to sacrifice [NAME] for it, but i‚Äôm okay with that...
Yeah that makes a lot of sense and I'm glad you looked passed all the negativity
Here, here. Cheers to starting fresh!
This is the same woman who fought tooth and nail to have wrongful convictions upheld while she was a prosecutor; she craves tyranny.
Omg what the ever loving bloody hell did I just read?? As an artist, this was extra painful to me.
I thought it was fairly common parents didn't let their young girls alone with boys or vice versa even though kids will do what they want.
Hey guys massive legend here
Mr. Krabs?
I also have a boner!
YES! I LOVE Olaplex :)
Congratulations fellow lobster!!
Nah. I think he will cheat on her like he did [NAME]
Finally some news from [NAME]. Hope he goes with DAZN. Would love to see him face [NAME] next.
This might be my favorite scene in the whole series
It's no coincidence that I became generally happier when I realized that once I covered the necessities more stuff didn't bring more happiness.
i curse you
üò≠ I wanted her to be on the top 4; now we‚Äôve heard plenty of times [NAME] mentioned so pretty sure ain‚Äôt gonna happen
No sorry still looking
Just walk ahead of everyone and be the leader
This is a gift for my rematch secret Santa recipient. I hope they‚Äôre both confused and amused.
Damn. Really?
> consider another better job Oh believe me I am doing that. But this will have to do for now!
"Also, on my phone this didn't show up as a ""cross post"". Sorry!"
Sarcasm :)
She‚Äôs sexy I‚Äôd hit.
Please give us updates. Oh wow.
I don‚Äôt squirm at much, but getting the notification sound and seeing this comment got a reaction outta me
I don't think you see it in the flames sub... if you do it's probably a joke
Looks like these guys were sold Brexit lies
"You know the first thing they're going to ask ""so, are you hungry?"" "
I am so relieved
You are AMAZING. I especially love the woman !! :)
Lol. Mod conspiracy theories. Yes they want to destroy the sub. That is their goal.
Just mild burns and witty comebacks...
What can you expect from guys who think everything based on sex and romance is solely based on a person‚Äôs looks and not at all their personality?
You forgot [NAME] and [NAME] as [NAME] and [NAME] in the 2003 *Battlestar Galactica*, which was spectacular. 
You gonn give me one of dem?
Nah we love telling people to post hog, you're just making our day better.
Not if the Pats are 4-12 that season.
Yep, just back to how it was before, but this time with little public support as we are all pissed of with it all
You can do a blanket report for police to investigate. You don't have to say who you are.
When I got to grow old yet... They'll either remember how much damage it all is just ridiculously macabre.
That isn't the issue. The issue is shilling your channel.
All this theft should be reported to the school so it can go on his spermanent record
Fried Egg is my #1 since cricket cafe stopped doing breakfast sandwiches.
Peace and love, my brother!
Props to this guy, that was an amazing comment. 
I'm glad you can relate. I'm glad in a really alienated, empty way. But glad, still. Probably.
It means she likes it when you do that thing.

My family voted for the Qualified Woman who was going to keep this country moving forward. So I don't have to worry about disownment :)
>[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
they should just stop broadcasting road games
Imagine that when you breath in, your lungs feel crispy, that‚Äôs what -10 feels like
Does it say how many servings are in the bucket? I'm really hungry.
Everything mentioned below, plus when [NAME] dicey Walmart convict boyfriend changed [NAME] diaper. [NAME] found out and went ballistic, and rightfully so.
Hate the Pats more. Hate Chiefs fans more.
As long as he doesn‚Äôt roll on the floor and then fix his hair it will be an improvement.
Bruh, I‚Äôve been getting this tough love since I was 18. Hence the dusty balls. 
Could fit the definition for thyroid disorder as well. Best to leave it to the professionals.
I can feel my left knee getting sore now
Ok that was a rude way to send him off. Can I have hot doctors again
Omg I‚Äôd happily live in Cape Town instead of the US!! It‚Äôs literally one of my favorite cities on earth!!
they are going to need a gardener soon!!
It‚Äôs like you guys actually **want** a dictator.
The kind look on his face certainly helps
Crows get hungry too you know and it's not like you were sharing
I find it kind of hilarious that you got downvoted for saying this
[NAME] wasnt elite for anywhere near 15 years. Surprises me how many people suggest this.
Now I wanna know how the hell did you stole the body of an NPC :o
I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some.
Wow she‚Äôs getting a spud in the head the next time I see her!
Yeah but who‚Äôs to blame when you are put into a seemingly meaningless game when all you care about is one rank. Bad system.
Hope for the best but still work as hard as we can.
please dont bring a woman in as a sex toy for you both. hire a sex worker instead
My friend, come, I sell you! 
Why nothing will change at all ... lol
Nah mate. I would kill for 3mb/s. On a good day i max out at about 450kb/s.
I'll call [NAME], somebody else get smashmouth ready
Don't worry, you'll find love, I promise! I hope you love yourself as well. <3
Power trip blindness is scary; how someone can't see the obvious aftermath of acting like this with their employees?
Idk, the Teen Mom subs are bad for this too. Really bad. 
I had shopping to put on the thing. Plus I wanted to go home.
Dregs of society still the dregs of society shocker.
"I was just about to comment this. Pause in between ""but"" and ""why"" too"
Don't think we should be stomping all over people's bodily autonomy just so public health authorities can declare victory.
Thank you :)
You don't look at accidents on the road? Yeah, I don't believe you.
If you can make a mini portal gun that would be awesome. But nonetheless, great work! 
I thought it was mildly interesting and don't regret watching it.
Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.
Definitely accurate, lasted about a month total in a Disney ‚Äúinternship‚Äù program... was more like slavery. Terrible experience that ruined Disney for me
What a bullet, and what a sequence for [NAME]
I‚Äôm totally having a fantasy about publicly shaming someone for giving their server attitude right now. Sweet justice.
If this gets put in a video, hi mom!
These are so handy for quick reference to when they play, thanks for posting!
"""You people""? I think [NAME] is a moron but I think the [NAME] hysteria is equally if not more so moronic."
So basically nowhere near the consensus required for a united Ireland. If a no-deal Brexit happens we can see.
well we tried hard. good effort boys!
Those in a position of authority at a school have to report abuse
I'm leaving to go get some more motherfucking jokes MOM [NAME]
Just googled this, apparently it's like cutting off a human's fingers down to the knuckle..... Your brother's girlfriend is a scumbag.

>[NAME] dead body lie the mud and she have smug face because she had her revenge against [NAME] What scene was this?
I‚Äôll defer to your experience then.
Slap her hand if she is trying to force you to do anything! Tell her not to put her hands on you, and enforce it every time. 
Highly reccomend it OP Listen i got 74 days cigerette free i couldnt be happier! My next step is quitting the juul which is gonna be rough
You look GORGEOUS and HEALTHY.
I understand that there are exceptions but saying a knife is as dangerous as, or more dangerous than a gun is a little ridiculous.
All these years I didn't know he escaped just to go to florida and kill some more smh

That's why I think we should clean house. No more leftists, no more whining.
You fruitcart, you oughta be ashamed of knowing that, let alone expecting anyone else to know.
I've always wanted to eat Youngstown State's mascot
Fantastic read, thanks for the insights! 
Who are you again?
[NAME] was the 4th best RB in the game, behind [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]
Normally the posts on this subreddit are pretty innocent and vanilla.....yeah not this one I think I‚Äôll pass on ‚ÄúTheDickPill‚Äù
thank you SO SO much for your help <3
It is bad tho.
[NAME]? Looks strangely like Five Points to me.
I was just kind of born into it, although ironically I was raised a cubs fan as well.
Because monogamy is unnatural.
Except she doesn't have a wall...
In the USA you would've gotten that imaging faster.... *then* mortgage your house for that knee replacement
Hmm, I'm 99% sure he says there's a call for her. Could be wrong 
HUGE difference e b/t ‚Äúseniors housing‚Äù and ‚Äúnursing home.‚Äù HUGE DIFFERENCE.
I fucking love New Years day with the Hawks playing in the Winter Classic
‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs sweetheart‚Äù?!? No wonder the rest of the world hates us...
Get. Paid. Upfront. You'll only learn that lesson once.
Thank you.. Yeah if she just want to talk she is definitely wasting my time.
Aww that makes my day too <3
"It says ""Just because someone *is here* illegally‚Ä¶"" No comment at all about how they got here."
Good riddance. I'm surprised it lasted that long. [NAME] is trash.
Yup that game was where I was like we have to draft him!!!!!
"""This confession means nothing"""
Credit where credit is due.
Worse. They told us to mind our own business
Congratulations, the most poorly written video game story in history made you think twice. You must be a genius. 
 funny, your asking for proof of something the moderators actively remove and then say ShOw Me pRoOf Or ItS fAkE.
Who had sent him threatening notes last week.
"Thanks for explaining. So [NAME] *did* pay for her ""show"" ? "
starters gone cold , put in the bench and see what happens
>Emotions like this will get you killed. That is too bad, considering I was planning on living forever.
But she spells oddly well, and these aren't small words. It's a bunch of interrupted/disjointed thoughts. 
I probably just watched whatever episode someone else is rewatching.
 '*Pray*, v. To ask that the laws of the universe be annulled in behalf of a single petitioner, confessedly unworthy.' ‚Äî [NAME]
One of our favorite rides.
Just subscribed! Keep strong bro focus on the end goal :)
No I've been here for 5 years :( it's just gotten worse and worse
Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP
My kids would have never gone back to sleep. You know your kids temperaments best though
I mean retirement age was set at 65 because it *was* the average age people died. Living beyond retirement was never supposed to be a guaranteed plan.
Ouch. That hurt the ego. And that‚Äôs not easy to do.
Nope. Just running from people wielding axes like a normal person. Instead of acting like a tough guy on the internet like you.
Oh. That's an... Interesting username. :
I would like to see the tree as well! :D:::
Really? It was clearly an accident.
Iirc she's alive but an alcoholic.
Well thats survival sweety. Run away live to fight another day. You on the other hand are the one that learns the hard way and ends up dying first!
I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to how much Netflix is paying people to make memes about Bird Box.
Wait is that [NAME] head in the up next?
That's great to hear! I had no idea we actually helped so many people with just a dumb sign and some cookies.
I was waiting for the delayed explosion and holy cow! That was insane!
It's a bug, don't listen to the pets people. Everyone is just a little to excited.
Oooooooh!!
I want to undo it, like it tasted good, but just **AGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh**
Of course. And dont think for a second we dont know who this really is! [NAME]!
[NAME] is both pretty and strong, I think it's a great name!
Polyamorous ain‚Äôt a sexual orientation hon
Wait, you don't believe he's infallible? Give an important instance where he has been wrong to prove that please.

Wow you just described how it feels talking to most of those T_D people
Infacy gosples?
Seek out a therapist? It sounds quite depressing n I wouldn't want it overwheming me.
Land near those coastal hotspots is running out. If you want to live in the Midwest, it's still cheap. 
It's shit, it's over, put the damn format to bed and send the cunts who make it over to Fox

Went from 0 to 60 real fast, there, duder.
Thank you u/closeteverything69, very cool!
I've read an optimum of 3 years between live births and to wait 12 months if there is a miscarriage before trying again.
This could be valid. Remember that [NAME] was basically non-existent for the first 4 or so episodes of S9
I think it looks great
No, it's a back massage at best. At worst it can give you a stroke and kill you.
> N.E.R.D. & [NAME] - Lemon > omg this came out in 2018?
[NAME] damn I wish you was located near me haha
Its important that we get members from all over the political spectrum, no one wants a circlejerk.
Go buy some stand-offs. The stop the ladder from falling sideways.
If they had tried to free their friends first, their bomb would have been confiscated so I say they made the right choice.
I don't want to go to meet the kids yeeeet. Im not yet ready ;(
Love the whole lebatard community but she has the most confidence speaking and it shows up on all the shows she does
Tried to think who else could compete for that honor and didn't come up with many: - [NAME] - [NAME] - [NAME] Anyone else?
I think the hulk could do all of that at once, and fold the wrench with his finger tips
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
Have some humility
I buy and sell iPhones and January has been slow for me too. Good luck to all of us.
This is the best thing I've seen so far in 2019. As a gamer and a human being this is love in video form üòä
Wow. Instant retirement money...
"Im not saying it wont be self titled, I could totally see that. What just asking how he knew it was ""fact"""
This is a customer service gig and you‚Äôre flipping people off, maybe you should find another line of work üòÇ
You just make her sound awesome.
[NAME] must have like 6 rebounds already
Arrow already did break this trend by having a mostly excellent S5, definitely much better than S3 and S4.
Test levels have been dropping significantly It‚Äôs well documented Why do you think that‚Äôs stupid
Feeling tacky ? You already working for [NAME] - might as well play the part haha
You're implying it by equating occasional defections to every single Republican voting against net neutrality
You're a hottie!
Title: geez another douche Text: ooh well lol
But that sounds yummy.
Happy New year!
When I looked at the picture, I thought for a moment that I was looking at a junk yard.
IS THIS NOT THE GOOGLE???? GOOGLE CHICKEN POT PIE RECIPE. DAMN TECHNOLOGY AND MELLINIALS.
[NAME]. Was that the reason you broke up with him lmao
>Popular >Secret Choose one.
True to the first, I hope to the second.
I'm not apologizing for it. I just didn't think there was something this blatantly immoral in the new testament.
Maybe that's why it's interesting.
Hey this is from blame the controller‚Äôs video
I‚Äôm feeling the same about the nets and hornets. I‚Äôm only worried the hornets can‚Äôt cover
This would still happen if they didn't have kids lol Most people engage in conversation time from time, OP. 
Oh! I didn't realize they were also vegan.
Thanks for posting.
I only remember her getting flamed by Thooorin yikes
Only time the police get any love
Let their deaths be swift
Bears suck!

[NAME]... I'm sorry. This is just wrong. I, can't.
None of the [NAME] said please or thank you to the waitress
Weird thing, but my cat will go HAM on my earhole if I let her.
I love finding people like this because there‚Äôs always at least one
He makes my man bits tingle. Loved him in Robin Hood Men in Tights just as much.
I love that this is written on notebook paper.
Also the infection that almost killed her because they tried to save the leg, leading her to get the prosthesis. 
. I‚Äôm a dude so I took sleeping medication and meditation alike, not respect/reverence for one day dammit.
I‚Äôm not sure how this is really a question. No, you should not allow your child around a known pedophile. In any capacity.
How is it the worst though? Me and my friends all use it and love it (since 2016)
Why the hell do we sit trae in crunch time we probably won't win. Give him the XP. Very frustrating.
He was a US Attorney and Mayor of NYC. He's not an idiot and knows exactly what he's doing.
yeah great idea, get buffed like an animal then shoot bricks in game
We're ALL what's wrong with this country
This is turtle thing
I'm so proud of you!
Lol oh shit everyone turn around
I'm no cosplayer, but that [NAME] needs some work.
It's a genious strategy, isn't it?
Oh sorry. Instead of ‚Äúwillfully stupid ‚Äú I meant, why do you hate America?
Mom.......MOTHERFUCKING CRACK
Right? Most days I wish I had really small ones so guys would look at ME instead of look at my body.
He's stealing J . Huges spotlight... [NAME] proud of himself again.
Very interesting documentary, just shows how devastating one punch can be.
I wish, then I wouldn't have had to pay full price for a switch and smash bros this xmas.
actually pretty hot tho
Um, I was agreeing the context was indeed *very* different. Not sure what you're getting at. 
This sub is literally retarded
Omfg das a lotta snow. Maybe I'll get to pull out the gas powered snow thrower for the bloody first timeof the season.
Enjoy spending yours oblivious and phony, slowly realizing as time progresses how very wrong you are. 
I would not say just one ... It took both [NAME] AND [NAME] to screw this one up!
I kinda figured it out after I edited that and reread it all. It then sunk in that I got baited harder than a fish.
NOO HES SO ANGRY
Prove it.
You are a great grandmother.
Ayyy you're welcome! x)
Other than Moose, the American Robin took me forever to find.
Thank you, you're awesome

Rover has treated us well.
came here to say this. i've watched it through more than five times at this point. one of my absolute favorites.
This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
No point in trying to maintain your mental health if no one would and does not even care about you.
As the Dark Lord [NAME] commands.
I‚Äôve started the journal part! But I unfortunately need to wait until he gets more aggressive for them to act on it.
Omg I love that. Coffee in bed. A nice omelette and then another roll in the hay.
Grey socks and leather sandals, that hurts me through the screen.
Completely disgusting.
Yeah fuck this shit, the dude isn't even doing anything noteworthy, it's just a man doing his job.
man this gif is weird both directions
About as odd as it is noticing a hockey players finger nails on tv
Ooooof, that‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôm sorry.
Oh, man. The whole story telling methodology was well done, and well paced.
I just get sad when I see people commenting on articles and videos about him that they think he's on drugs.
You dont know how much that boosted my self-esteem right now. Thank you stranger
If he was a rap ‚Äòmusician ‚Äò then I‚Äôm all in favour.
Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.
Your comment has been removed for containing a slur. Avoid using t- in the future.
Nobody is shaming them for trying to stop article 13. Youtube is being shamed for being hypocrites.
Your amazing too!
I try to keep my hands busy. I would do better when I have acrylic nails because it wasn‚Äôt as easy/just wasn‚Äôt the same.
Whoa I didn‚Äôt even think he was a husky from the first picture.
This is awesome! I really wish I could make it!
Redditors are racist.
Replacing pillows often is also important. Buy more less expensive pillows. I love pillows from Ikea.
2019 should just be a picture of a trash can or dumpster on fire. Amazing how shitty DICE can make things in 10 years.
Thank you [NAME].
69 levels in one week?
Wait is this the original template where all the satire comes from?
Would be a real shame if someone volunteered to call [NAME] and ask [NAME] about dating a [NAME] who banged [NAME] and thirsts for Feits
Yes, I know. But thanks, no damage to the second car and just some scratches on mine.
They certainly haven't re-used a plot reveal that is now 40 years old.
my soul has long been destroyed :( it‚Äôs over for us nosoulcels
Oh whoops haha
You‚Äôre braver than me, thank you for your service O7
Thanks. It‚Äôs extremely hard to keep in mind
[NAME] has been playing pretty nice since he's been freed from dnps
this may have already been asked but what about the pelvic bones found in the quarry?? how tf is [NAME] still in prison??
Be careful of drugs like MDMA. Often people regret taking it.
"As long as the minority aren't ""minorities"" I don't see the problem. /s"
Apparently not successfully.
If everyone agrees I'll witness this bet. Just so you know the NRA and Kremlin don't count as charities though.
I‚Äôm just waiting for the right director to actualize this subversion of our expectations.
I would absolutely hate it if they used it in the games tbh
Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
Gah!!! I wish you well! Also, what NERVE they have.... wow.
This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
[NAME] Just sell the team your true love is the Chicago white suxs
"""I'm a lady! I do ladies things!"" He's a real life [NAME]!"
I'm a D.Va main at the moment so that one's a check chief.
I would make sure I didn‚Äôt leave any soda cans anymore so I could have the high ground, and then hide all but one cup lol
They will most likely be branded as PKK symphatizers by Turkish media. Which sucks because next time something like this happens some of them might get shot
"It was SO hard to click the upvote button on this one. It's one of those ""I hate it. Well done"" moments."
He‚Äôs fine for a 3rd string.
[NAME] does more than [NAME] so I'll have do disagree about that
As a person who lives in NYC, I couldn't possibly agree more
Well then, I can't wait for you to prove me wrong but your throwaway comment isn't helpful.
news article about the story.
How did you get them for free?
This is so sweet. Thank you for being an awesome parent !
Its free karma
This live meet the queens is awkward AF, I‚Äôd rather them produce this and make us watch nicely edited stuff.
I didn't see anything in that comment referring to a cactus.
*Keeps stepping on cracks*
You didn't need to split this into two posts...
Bruh I‚Äôd just go home, climate change is important but really though. 
Looked like [NAME] for some reason
Mammatus clouds! Somewhat unusual for Sydney
My son is ten months. I hope we have this relationship when he turns 14. Congrats on your lovely teen ‚ô•Ô∏è
Being alone isn't the problem. Being **forever** alone is the problem.
[NAME] baby where you going.
I love all things supportive of books and spreading their wonderfulness.
Next commercial break mute your TV and watch this for old times sake
Thanks for the advice
Yea, Í∞úÏù∏Î©¥Ìóà costs about 1Ïñµ, which is around 100k.
How are they significant? Israel does these exercises all the time?
Does anyone here think this will actually turn the Jet's around? I feel like this is the worst shit ever.
Removing republicans is the first step. You can scream about how they are the same, but perhaps you should look at voting history. Good luck. 
Was blown away until I heard everyone speaking Spanish and realised it was Mexico. Not so shocking anymore.
It wouldnt. Legalization would drive consumers towards legal vendors.
fashion now wont age any better.. thats just the cycle of those things.
TIL cheddar cheese didn't originate in the U.S. Thank you!
I def think [NAME] has a lot of upside still, but yeah just a bummer that he's no [NAME].
She completely understands, that's why she does this.
He looks like that one guy
And this is actually one of the nicer flats you can get in Boness too!
Ugh yeah it‚Äôs really tiring. I‚Äôm in a public place right now and just had like, 3 mood swings. 
I'm so uncomfortable.
I think that question has a very complicated answer
Or perhaps we should look at the bigger problem: mental healthcare in the United States.
You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.
dude,,, same i cried today because i couldn‚Äôt go to the gym bc my foot was too swollen to wear shoes lol
She even tweeted the Ghost Adventures crew, oh wow. 
Hold on.... Why are we using OKCupid anyway. Wasn‚Äôt it basically proven that more than 50% of its user base is fake.
So much confetti
Ah. Yea, the classic loner looking for compliments. Seems pretty edgy
That makes sense. Never thought of it like that
*Samsung Other Android phones don't have Bixby, that's Samsung's BS (and yeah, it's terrible. I have the button / feature completely disabled)
Haaaa! That's awesome! Sounds like my town, Alamogordo, New Mexico.
This is exactly what I told him. I went the fuck off. Lol
That really doesn't make much sense, the return couldn't have much to do with it.
There it is. Knew it was ‚ÄòH‚Äô something, had a brain fart
Oh man, dream date right there. Zoo then sushi?? Yes please. 
Eh. Totally possible. Even if he did know he's drunk and could be having a laugh about it.
He broke the wheel so bad it's going backwards
Are we gonna ignore the fact that he passed someone in the right lane???? That‚Äôs illegal
[NAME] a good guy who hosts leagues full of people who want to have fun. Check it out!
IDK how you can tell how they look from there tiny baby casket, but ok.
That little smile at the end is exactly why she looks fun.
OK man I am relatively new so I know what worked for me and I based off of much of the advice I got, partially from this reddit lol
OHHHH, I like where Richmond is going with that.
I see your point as well. I wasn‚Äôt the one complaining. I was supporting the one everyone was going after
Winchester and b95
Let's get things back on track! Happy new year!
Ground vehicles too it seems. Obviously wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if the game shipped complete with proper vehicle customization.
Very very accurate.
There is a steam game about this called 'Not Tonight'.
I see, Unfortunately I don't think equity has ever turned out well in history. Humans have tried many times and failed with catastrophic consequences.
My coworker got cheated on by her boyfriend of 8 years and needs a night out so I can't even get out of it sigh.
Well, if that's how you always are, I can't imagine even wanting to be next you let alone have deer like sex with you.
Added to my meme folder. Thanks!
We love him, duh. He's our NT captain and our ace.
Wow. These people really deserve some *clove*, especially on subshops.
My nightmares don't tend to be realistic, but many kid's toys can lose a piece and be swallowed. 
I wonder what he's listening to...
"Sorry but why does it matter that you're ""from /r/All""? "
My no. 1 favorite quote on the show right here
Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
Yes, that's what I'm confused about. Playing RE5 solo.
Not exactly the cream of the meme crop there. And on a personal note I don't think ironically bad memes are funny.
I didn‚Äôt say anything. Just sharing this beauty.
>Cars kill more people than guns Way, way more people. Alcohol too.
Same. You run a progressive or I will not vote
"Grown men who decide to call themselves""young loli girl"" probably aren't interested in understanding how rape affects society."
Our father is looking down on this ugly world from the sky.
You're fine! Go ahead and vent, that's sorta what this subreddit's for. I'm the same way, don't worry.
He was so close to me x
Why is this downvoted? It‚Äôs right.
Only 5 hour drive..... I guess im doing a day trip to Almonte. I love baked goods.
The Dark Knight that didn't rise?? Home Alone.. forever?
Awesome photo, love the bricks in the background and the color suits you chose. Very nice gents! 
It only points out that when only men can change things concerning gender inequality there is an obvious gender inequality.
I'M HERE
But once it's born, if its parents can't afford food, shelter and medical care, it can go fuck itself.
I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
If [NAME] supporters trigger you more than mass murdering, child/wife abusing terrorists then I'd say you need to be admitted to a psych ward
Can confirm he does not follow the 49ers on Instagram.
That poor mercy. Just died to die again xD
I have a college-level understanding of biology, as it is my degree of choice. Those 8th-graders are completely right. 
[NAME]! Scoring ridiculous goals while missing sitters. Love it :-)
It changed 6 years ago
Right... so true. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this too.
Wow after that [NAME] turnover, I've never turned off a game so fast

If New Jersey are going to win it in the winter they better get something done quickly..
* No flaming or insults
Yes I would rather have a government agency waste the money on food stamps. Right wing moron.
Saame god I try to picture myself as a more attractive version of myself if that makes sense but it's all just fantasy :(.
I was aware I would be going to hospital and would be showing the teacher up (should have mentioned it)
What a sweet, sweet bird! Also, that is one tiny pup!
Maybe that's why she was trying to buy a firearm. To lead the fight against the alien invasion.
Not under [NAME]. Under [NAME] desperate greedy extreme partisan coward politics. They purposely brought racism front and center.
you guys are mean lol. teacher said talk to a forum if there's no existing church. thanks anyways
They are high pressure hoses, think about getting waterboarded.
Damn look at [NAME] and his insane get off. We could use an [NAME] now probably now than anyone on this roster.
wow I think you've really got her now
Ah thanks. I was posting on mobile so sub rules aren‚Äôt as obvious.
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND

Literally any type of pepper, Bell, chilli etc. Pain in the arse but I‚Äôd rather limit my choices than have that allergic reaction again. 
OMG, my two favorite franchises and the two best girls!!
No lol it's just the sub's flair. Also I was joking about good as gold, that's a song of [NAME] lol
Wow, that‚Äôs a big 3 year old!
Muddy Rudder has Irish music on Sunday evenings.
I'm just saying as far as having incoherent political worldviews goes... it's ironic...
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm high enough to get this
Imagine we hadn't spent money on Barkley, Drinkwater, and Bakayoko. The money there would've been enough to buy someone like Isco
I‚Äôm so excited for next season. My expectations are slowly climbing.
Good grief... cushion those talons with some toilet paper or Kleenex next time. It‚Äôll give you better traction, too. 
do people actually dislike space cop or is that a meme?
This is the seat [NAME] should be running for....
Fast as [NAME] will carry me. Seriously uptown to downtown via Claiborne or broad isn‚Äôt that bad
Good for you OP! I hope you find a much better playgroup soon!
Is that the dude from spiderman?

Eagles fan here. is this goalpost an old meme here? or was it due to recent circumstances?
Funny how [NAME] only lies when you want him too,amazing.
By [NAME]! By [NAME]! It's the grand Champion!
And yet ‚Äú50 Shades‚Äù got a major release...hmmm
Truly a blessed day for you! Shine on!
No kidding, this dude is trying to drown some serious demons.
I got second hand embarrassment so hard my face is still red after few minutes of glancing at one of those google docs.
This is genius! I‚Äôm going to start doing this now too. Thanks!
It may be wrong, but it‚Äôs not far from the truth. 
Obviously. Every post here is intended to be a joke. Just not funny ones, like this post.
There are videos of him blending the two songs together too....
I can't believe you won!
Thank you.
I didnt say otherwise, I just think that it shouldn't happen at all. It just shows how outdated and incompetent the league is.
That's unreal. Be homeless, drag a giant bag of leaking cans on board, piss yourself and nobody bats an eye. 
Which one is he playing?
i communicate through morse code by constantly crouching and standing up. I generally prefer explaining how my oponent can improve when i beat them badly
What are they doing up there?

Appreciate it.. just for trolls sake Plot Twist : The one trick has no mic XD
RED ALERT RED ALERT
You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.
This works for me too. Not sure why either.
They follow me when I water the plant pots.
Like I said, most loved and most hated for now. We'll all get over it eventually. 
The guy just loves drama
What you fiend!!!!! But seriously, how do these guys feel about animals fucking then?
Oh no you got us Feminism canceled Pack it up y'all
Lol, exactly what a failure would say.
How about breaking into tears whenever one of your friends tells you they trust you because you never understood what trust meant
Yeah he does give intense and memorable performances. He didn't get to speak in Mad Max for like half an hour but he was still riveting.
What do you mean strap around the bulls nuts?!,!? Sorry not into rodeo things 
Are you allowed to voice any political opinion on Youtube or are they also censoring based on this?
A couple of times I thought she was going to start laughing.
Sometimes we pick the bad option to make a point.
No one drinks Old Style

Keep on going. I'm at 21 days.
That cat's jump when the coyote takes his eyes off him.. Ouch!
How are you 100% positive that you're pregnant if you haven't taken a test yet?
You're not retarded. It's a natural reaction to a lousy upbringing. Love your username BTW.
You are delusional if you think big oil and existing deeply entrenched and rich traditional energy can‚Äôt pay scientists more money than new renewable energy can.
nope! she meets up with robb en route to the twins and he sends her back to riverrun to not spite the freys. little did he know..

I laughed so hard.
I love him even though the newest season of t@gged kinda sucked.
*Redditor for less than 30 days* New troll account, eh?
Also, do you have a link with updates? I cannot find any reports like this. 
He chose to live as long as possible until pneumonia took him out. People should have the choice not to live until the very end.
I'm 50% convinced this is [NAME] posting and I'm here for it
I get hella pissed when people who are shorter than me complain about being too tall.
Ya did good, bud.
Funny, the right only seems to say this about women and people of color ü§îü§îü§î
Back to not getting a seat despite being 3 stops from the end of the line.

Hyperthyroidism? Best get into a GP and get bloodwork done because many of these symptoms cannot be explained by mental illness.
Bubble Bass should try it, just DON'T FORGET THE PICKLES!! 
Most accurate of the 5 places I've seen this today.
Thank you. Your suggestion is a better term. I don't think mine is a poor choice but yours is better.
Thats fair. I know its a joke it just always struck me as odd how people wrote it off. No worries.
Thank you so much!
That's what they want though. So if you really want to 'win' their battles, simply ignore them :)
I switched the the Smok Novo and I like it. Close enough to the juul.
I don't mind posts bashing NOED or DS. But I wish this one would make sense or would be funny.
Thanks everybody!
You‚Äôre a nut if you don‚Äôt think the pubs are far more corrupt than the dems.
I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.
Honestly don't know why they are still working so hard on this trade, really need another starter.
It was white, just had some black beads on the bodice. Thanks, that was really interesting! 
You're an uneducated twat.
Because they enjoy their toxic umoderated cesspool, apparently. Either way i'm done trying to care.
I forgot to reply last night, I talked to Microsoft and their engineers were working on the issue. The store was just not installing for anyone haha
10,000th franchise win (against Boston) was cool, also 2017 ALDS game 4 (my only playoff game ever) 
The importance of believing in [NAME] and see, and sticking with them, when you realize they're good things

His army of Swedish blondes are going to be upset.
Are your daughters twins?

[NAME] vs [NAME] has been a great match... hope [NAME] can give a fight for the fourth set!
What a coincidence. I also had a Bort.
I mean, I try to just avoid grizzly bears, don't you?
Sorry man. Didn't realize I was talking to a Russian spam bot. Please give my best to [NAME].
I can deal with pupper and doggo in moderation but heckin, hooman, fren all make me irrationally angry.
Yeah I don‚Äôt see any yellow. That‚Äôs a solid bright green to me.
"very wise, your flair reminds me of the quote ""There can be no true despair without hope."""
Maybe she realized that what she did was extremely stupid so she was trying to hide her face so that her shame would somehow disappear.
Looks like Jack the cat with the super deep meow.
he was always WC. was banging them in for the arsenal since he was 20 yrs old.
Well that is just absurd
My wife really likes Deja but hasn‚Äôt listened to TDAGARIM. I‚Äôm so excited for when she hears it for the first time.
Woman here - $50 per orgasm please! I could easily make $300 in a half hour wankfest...
Omg so short but such a bop! I‚Äôm so excited for her album
Fuck calm down [NAME]
unblockables and cc moves do not affect him while in bulwark stance or at least he can also counter them (not sure how the stance works)
Chiefs look soft
Considering that cheating is a mark of high-status, I'd be surprised if the wife dumped a cheating husband.
[NAME] 12 min long? That other 1 min video spoiled me.
Go lie somewhere else. Go to Faux News or something. They,ll believe you.
The reductionism is the only thing these feeble minds comprehend.
It looks nineteen to me.
"""You're right. Things are boring. You should find someone who isn't boring. I will too."""
Thats what happens when [NAME] is on the fucking floor
If you don't patent, then don't complain
People at alphabet freaking out rn

Break ups are hard. Hope you feel better.
I wish I could say the same, I feel like something important would happen and I wouldn‚Äôt know
Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
I remember seeing her twitter profile when it all went down and she was a rocket
I would eat the everloving bejeesus out of that pickle.
**GET OUT NORMIES! OUT!**
Reality is often disappointing
I don‚Äôt have to stop speaking fact simply because it‚Äôs uncomfortable for you to hear.
The Netflix version is being produced by the marketing team for the festival. It‚Äôs gonna be great to see the different slants
hell yeh dude
I don't bother diagnosing it in people with BPD. The handful of genuine DIDs that I was referring to were people who didn't have BPD.
look at more of [NAME] work, he really makes the picture come to life.
And then thigh high socks in addition?
"""Police are on their way, ma'am, just stay calm."""
[NAME] nerds thinking they are cool by assigning some bullshit fantasy words to error messages...theater mode is probably just acting up
What is it with everybody doing extreme sumo deadlifts right now? Like yeah wow you can lift 2x your bodyweight 2 inches, well done.
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Beach House are my two favourite bands.

It‚Äôs a shame we have to face the islanders so soon
He did all this road to find this coconut oil ! Are you ungrateful ? :( !
Happy cake day! Have a great day and year, cheers. 
I was just about to comment this. Do people think throwing an lol at the end of everything will just make it fine and dandy. Ridiculous lol.
Who do you have in mind?
I didn't say that or imply it, nice try.
For me, I tend to (over)share with friends, but also get offended at trivial questions like you.
Well that‚Äôs dumb. The question is about this sub.
At least there‚Äôs still more likes than dislikes
There is a reason I said allegedly.
That... That makes a lot more sense than what I thought they were chanting.
Just wanna say I appreciate you posting these videos every few days!
Her upper lip always looks terrible - such an easy fix, can‚Äôt believe she is so vain and never bothers to wax 
Aah I hope he's okay. So glad it's back! Time to get creeped out tonight.
Ohhh. [NAME] is my absolute favorite person ever. She just gets better as the season goes on. Enjoy!

Thank you for your service
Yeah, ive had a lot of time to myself to find the words to describe the pain. So youre welcome. 
"""But Aunt [NAME], I don't *want* to send Grandma back to Italy!"""
Why a 14 year old? WHY WEAR LIP STICK WHEN KISSING PAPER?
Yup, same as you but when I'm waking up. Too much effort trying to remember letters with little meaning when I'm waking up.
I really applaud you for your patience...
You don't immediately have to start talking about the issue, you can just talk about something else first to get to know the person. 
Im not looking to be forgiven lol. I still stand by what i said. Pll only read half my comment and ran with it
This is a crime against humanity and the FBI is on its way. Do not try to leave your current location, you are being tracked.
Thanks for the response.
Super dumb that people are downvoting you for asking a question in good faith.
ok that's kind of cool....
That's not what I said. Re-read my comment.
She got the death penalty...? fck me.
Also r/justnomil holy doodles man they are nutso.

Because it was a terrible idea.
Would you have been ok with a vet min contract on Ziggy with a $1 million per start incentive?

So happy I bought a PC. If you‚Äôre looking for a better experience across ALL games I suggest you do the same.
[NAME] royally fucked up that last rotation. Also did [NAME] even get a single kill with their specialists ?
Lmao I hope almost seems like it just vanished. If someone who likes xans finds my wallet they‚Äôre in for a good day
I like this a lot
Okay. I‚Äôm not a [NAME], but I love block games? Idk
For example, I think this picture of [NAME] character from southpark) is soooo cute
This is one of the most entertaining posts I've seen in a long time. Got a little adrenaline surge when he jumped. Wow.
It is certainly interesting.....but is it anything?.....
I mean, I hope so. I bought his jersey, which would be embarrassing if he was out the league in two years.
This is really helpful, thanks!
Nothing. He can hold the SOTU wherever he'd like. [NAME] uninvite is just political theater
At least he had some good cushioning.
Where are you getting that information from?
Exactly my point, he was tearing up the U23's but hasnt been able to push on with the first team chances he was given.
Acne scars unfortunately and also out of anxiety I tend to pick at my skin.
their just mad because i love olicity and i think it's the best ship in the whole arrowverse. oh and because i think laurel is trash.

People requesting asylum are not illegal immigrants so that argument is bull shit. Get informed by an actual news source please
Im very interested. Contact me if you are going to set one up and want/need help.
Definitely surprised we took out [NAME] there. We needed to finish the quarter strong and it went straight to shit when he left.
Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
He's hilarious
Small group of friends either outside or at home listening to good music would be ideal for me. Maybe even one sober person to drive our high asses around
Give it time people will figure out the truth if you engage with her then that gives her what she wants. She will definitely use that against you.
Yo you USA? I‚Äôm on pc and want some people to play bo3 with.

Bye that's it for me. I'ts all over.
Happy cake day
Yes Will do thanks alot!!
How do I do this exactly? I am trying to go the less texting the better route but she initiates the contact.
Aha thank you!. I didn't know there is a ca one
I'm sad that you are against abortion. Can I drop my unwanted baby off at your door ?
I mean, if it's no questions asked how would they know you're not a resident? 
That‚Äôs an early contender for title of the year 2019. Bravo.
What was I expecting smh
Yes, risky. In fact don't click it at all.
No matter which way you slice it there is something very punny about the Hotel Lobby.
This is creepy af
I'm so glad you have access to that trans group. You will make friends and be able to support each other.
I accidentally found it while googling things about ‚Äúnot wanting to be [RELIGION]‚Äù and ‚Äúfeeling trapped in [RELIGION]‚Äù ect.
I have a feeling this is gonna get really crowded, and end up being a shit show with such short notice for everything.
Keep in mind with these verses you've selected you aren't mentioning how we must he crucified in the flesh with [NAME].
**[NAME] intensifies**
Parliament won't let a hard brexit go through, there are far too few MPs who would accept it.
That is one adorable meow loaf
When did we get rid of uprights? He was amazing for us?
EO here. This is correct. It's folk theology, popular with some, but is certainly not dogma.
this is the perfect example of something that is a terrible combination without being outright disgusting.
No you shouldn‚Äôt. If you recieve income, it should be taxed.
this is so unbelievably adorable
But some people are not on that subreddit, he is just reminding all the people in the [NAME] faction
Thank you, this makes a lot of sense. I know i need to trust them and not try and read behind what they're saying... 
You clearly don't understand alimony.
Haha, maybe at the 55 title party in May 
Lol this match was like 1/3rd the time of what I expected
That's literally not me, and he didn't say anything about skin
Why? I've got your attention and thats when the fun begins
I'm glad you're feeling better! Keep smiling :)
I‚Äôd crap myself if that happened to me.
She just needs to kiss [NAME]
When did you apply for this? The new AFI was published Oct of 2018. Have you already PCSed from Korea?
How did such a veteran make such a rookie mistake
Never let facts get in the way of a good story.
except the man with the drum APPROACHED THEM! seriously maybe if they hit him with a bike lock the way [NAME] did they wouldnt be covered
True enough, I just hope there are more reasonable people than not. 
I bet he‚Äôs not going to visit their hall of fame in order to avoid meeting w/ [NAME]
Wait for it...
Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers.
That's gorgeous!
HE SAID YOUR FLY IS UNDONE
Bro, it's only game, why you heff to be mad?
Offense does too. Love [NAME] but he's hurting our spacing being out there so much.
I'd be happy to make a donation if you've got some left!
"Thanks; it is a major turn-off because there's no reasoning - he ""knows"" it's a fact. I appreciate your perspective."
That's not how it works
I'm still insisting he is not her dad...
I mean purely in the context of these pants he isn‚Äôt wrong
I‚Äôm very happy for you! Congrats! üòÅ
This is awesome! Saw you on r/entwives and pmd you btw! Congrats!
Wouldn't take much to be the best COD dev team tbh.
Asking the right questions You can't do that on reddit tho
Logic and facts are verboten on that sub. Truly bizarre that people are that sensitive.
I'm concerned because I understood it as well. Is Kykko a bot?
You can't freely make a decision when your opinions are a shitty contract or life on the streets. That is not freedom.
There's literally nothing wrong with it except you being worried about the purity of your partner like c'mon.
Right? I was kind of hoping [NAME] would get to take a crack at it.
This wouldn‚Äôt feel so bad if sales and footfall weren‚Äôt but many external pressures were keeping profits down.
Ah got it. Marked it sorry!
Nailed it all I do is giving words but all you get his 'your own mind reflecting' Get me ?
I'd just feel less out of place, I guess. My SA makes me feel like I'm so behind my peers in terms of a social life
Thank. Regardless, the fact that you can stay at 1mg kpins is fantastic
It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad. 
I would think that I hope the Wilpons die.
My name is [NAME]. You killed my father, prepare to die.
This is not r/lostredditors material if we just try to find something stupid on it.
What a beast! Self defense definitely, hopefully the brain trauma will teach them a thing or two ^^^probably ^^^not though
Alright Nice thanks
Ha! Yup same-same! He was my first intimate relationship. I have had other drunk encounters but I don‚Äôt count them lol
Maybe when they get away from David cage finally the plots won't be so Melodramatic and on the nose.
[NAME] steals the game! (and the puck for bouncing off of Detroit players)
Can't just GA it but can do A LOT more than pretend it doesn't exist and take it yourself. What a cop-out argument that is.
I give you points for making me very surprised to see [NAME] up there. I'm glad he is.
I never even talk to my mom and I‚Äôm 40.
You have no idea how high I can fly.
omg this sport is so insane and I love it
Their mere presence is all it takes, but being outgoing, gregarious or charming is icing on the cake.
Thanks man, it‚Äôs sucks that I‚Äôm paying to get left on read
Its less than a year old... Doesnt it seem longer
I got the same call, voicemail was definitely Chinese but I deleted it and marked the number as Spam/Blocked 
So. Fucking. Tone. Deaf.
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs rare, but never?
It's just a sexy hamburgler cosplay
Ehhh he got played so hard on the [NAME] vs [NAME] situation in 2017. Lost credibility after that for me
Lol what an edgelord
Fucking Synths. -[NAME]
I'd be shocked if he knew much of anything about the EU.
This will not happen bru
Congrats, still waiting on getting called for an interview for another internal position. Applying around Christmas HR is so fucking slow.
This is amazing. Love these edits.
It is. I mean official translation is coming every 7 days, but leaks go day before (Korean)
Fuck this gif
Yes it was very hard but I appreciate it.
I'm not sure if [NAME] is visiting the Podesta pizza party.
It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs forcing a fake British accent it‚Äôs so strange
Might not have the funds after just losing their mother and all the costs associated with that and losing that support system.
You're right, it's not as bad as the crippling retardation you currently suffer from. I'm sorry dude
Right?? It makes no sense she‚Äôs horrible
no I meant, it would appear if I just walk up and have the ability, without doing anything else. 
These are the only causes that are remotely stomachable for me.
There is also no dog in the white house. Why? Because dogs can smell an asshole a mile away.
Hate Hate Hate, feels so good.
Wait, you have friends that love you? You're gonna be okay dude. I promise. 
Oh thank you! I hadn‚Äôt even realized :D
This‚Äôs didn‚Äôt hold up too well.
(Edit). not sure you know what you are mentioning.
You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
Why do you guys hate [NAME]? I‚Äôm neutral leaning slightly positive on him. Just curious why the strong negative opinion?
Aww that's so sweet !
There are going to be designated periods where you can make team changes. We just don‚Äôt know when those are yet
That [NAME] cover though... Turned over to [NAME] at that point.
So, I saw the video yesterday. I think there are real complaints by residents, but that video isn't normal, and absolutely crosses into antisemitism.
I want [NAME] to come back and do [NAME]
No, [NAME] is dating [NAME]
Thank you!! That‚Äôs me as [NAME]!
Here in the UK I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve never seen a taco
[NAME] as if he wouldn't just cut the bullet in half
Might be wrong but isn't it [NAME] who wanted gase more than mac
You die.
I want to die
Just because you lack critical thinking and reading skills doesnt mean i am a moron, it means you need to learn how to think for yourself.
This one is the worst, by far
Our 2nd unit is as bad as anybody in the NBA
Please respect our sub's rule against belittling [RELIGION].
Wishing death upon someone you have never met and just know from TV. Nice
Probably clipped wings too, judging by the way it went down. Idiots.
They might trade for [NAME] or give France a chance. Still scratching my head at letting CV go.
It's bad when that sounds tasty to me
Meh, the Chiefs got gifted a PI call or two, especially on their last drive to tie the game.
Car just saw a chance to escape. Car took the chance.
You both are 80s kids
I'll keep u updated man. It's only a 7eth withdrawal so hopefully it processes quickly.
Imagining doing something this drastic all alone is just... I can't fathom the anxiety. Man.
What? Who said I hated him? I dont give a damn about him either way.
So are some women. A couple of my friends have this very issue.

[NAME] You are the ultimate forhead Winner!!! Chose your price!
if the game would stop crashing on my ps4 that would be great :c
HOLY SHIT CHANCE
I subbed to 2meirl4meirl back in 2016. It failed to pique my interest. Now every post feels like my life.
You can make a complaint and get damages if this happens. They are required to not pester you for two years if you fill it in online.
Imagine being so indoctrinated, that you believe that any place that doesn't actually talk shit about [NAME] constantly is a right wing circle jerk. 
It look like so much then I realized that I don‚Äôt leave my house

Kids in Africa could have eaten those cigarettes.. :( Kidding. Good for you man. Congrats!
Russia is at war with the tchetchen , no ?
It‚Äôs not satisfying at all. If this wasn‚Äôt [NAME] it wouldn‚Äôt be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.
‚ÄúHello darkness my old friend...‚Äù
Give it time. Pain like that needs to heal just like open wounds. I really hope that you will eventually start to feel better.
He probably misread it as *gunst*, he didn't come here for gunst.

I talked to her family previous co workers and friends

This is awesome. But also r/dontdeadopeninside
Need to go middle of the road no [NAME] is going to vote for [NAME].
Because you're lying
You‚Äôre right. Thank you for the context and information.

We did it guys! We‚Äôre the real heroes!
Okay just thought it would be a good idea.
[NAME] has progressed so much this season. Took him a little bit to start getting his confidence but I‚Äôm a lot more excited about his future now
It‚Äôs all the same, the number makes no difference.
[NAME] are as anti-men as democrats. Forcing your kids to be masculine because they're boys is as bad as brainwashing them with feminist crap.
So glad I discovered that subreddit a couple months ago. So good...
I feel left out... I never get invited to our new world order meetings with our elders of zion
Nooo. Ireland will now lose those two rounds. The world is unfair

Motherfucker!!
[NAME] supporters don‚Äôt see it as offensive.
Thank you, I will check it out once I get home :D
Yeah people used it as precedence. That‚Äôs very sad. What‚Äôs your point? What abhorrent treatment?
What am I missing here? It's a noun, so no past tense?
I liked it because [NAME] is a fat lard and he was pissed off.
You're championing the removal of some threads while complaining about the removal of threads...
I thought that said affordable, and i was really concerned
I truly hope so
Thanks - Glad I did not waste the money / gold

Previously it wasn't working, now its fine though
He looks like the demon all the other demons beat up for lunch money
The last few years have really woken me up to how *misleading and harmful* journalism is to our society.
Going small here... interesting

Happy to assist with the credit repairs. I've been in the industry for over 20 years. It takes time but it's fixable.
Even if you were, all good my dude! Shouldn't comment on something too quickly lol

And when the 4th Quarter needed it most, it vanished!
I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money.
Downtown LA has some great Spanish/Hispanic clubs that play great [NAME] music. You should try La Cita, Las Perlas, or Las Ca√±as. All great clubs/venues.
In bases loaded situations last year, opponents hit .500 against [NAME]. He was a far cry from the [NAME] of old. 
It doesn‚Äôt really change anything, just side with your preference 
Sorry buddy I think that one is permanently dead. :(
Not on academical level, but on family and bonding and respect for people who have lost their dearest ones
Wow the Doc on her was confusing me because so many other sports peak *after* college. Cool.
Yes I do, I even tried a brand new pod as well and nothing
Go and feel it so your body can let it go.
If it were food, it wouldn't be made of warm. 11/10 cat logic. 
Oh [NAME], me and kiwi or pineapple. Or that feeling when a tortilla chip gets stuck in the roof of your mouth
We have tradable assets next year and cap space the year after. We don‚Äôt need to implode to retool.
This gives me anxiety and heartburn just looking at it!
Sorry to link it here but would love to get some opinions on this post
Yepp, plenty of people like a nice big bush! I literally have no preference and think both are totally sexy. 
You don't have a point. Yes there are aspects of crypto that is confusing. Getting confused between buying BTC or BCH is not one of them.
brah the usps loses a few billions each and every fiscal quarter. they are totally insolvent and entirely dep3end on tax payer money.
Human thought she was playing with the cat. The cat just wanted to get drunk.
That's exactly what I thought too!!!!
80 minutes too late
Is it just me or is the print WAY off kilter?
hello there¬° That one time i said i liked sex.
even though its alot of work, i got 100% this weekend, and that scene re-opened the wound, lemme tell ya. what a masterpiece
> I know I should feel happy why
Don‚Äôt explain how you‚Äôre feeling to her either. Women like men who‚Äôs feelings are unclear.
too damn often!! and i‚Äôm cute as hell! i‚Äôm mad!!
"I don't think there's any ""most women"" on this. For me, it took well over a year after my marriage broke up."
At least you admit it. That is good.
Weird we‚Äôve seen leftist harass and attack elder people and elder veterans but it doesn‚Äôt become mainstream news. I wonder why that is
No idea but as of last year there was a cat that liked to hang out there. Hope he‚Äôs okay ‚ù§Ô∏è
Idk why you're surprised. [NAME] and [NAME] had identical philosophies. It's why the offense didn't change when he came back.
I think there is something odd about it too... We will probably get the truth it the not to distant future, but no one will care. 
Oh look me
I don't think the blame rests entirely with America (those woh joined the taliban still made a concerete choice) but no US forces are not innocent.
"I think putting the slur in the title of the video and using it frequently is a little bit more than ""simply acknowledging"" it. "
So, it turns out the chants were projection as well.
Gorgeous cats, poor babies
If I'm not mistaken we will have [NAME] as backup next year so not bad at all.
Um that laundry pump situation was pretty nifty. And dude that ghetto tool box/marker holder was pretty legit. [NAME] not [NAME]
Not to be harsh but I feel like she has been dieting and working out for quite some time .. wouldn‚Äôt there be some change by now ?
I need a loop of [NAME] falling lol
No, absolutely not. How bout if you have more to lose you be more careful about not breaking the law. 
I can't believe people are saying [NAME] should have been saved, she knew like 10% of the words
Too bad it wasn‚Äôt a sword.
That's a big meal.
This movie was awesome, what‚Äôs wrong with you? I‚Äôm sure the next one is gonna be totally rad.
People are legitimately monsters.
I don‚Äôt like [NAME] all that much, but that dude seems cool. I hope it hits a goofy dark line like [NAME] or [NAME] tho.
oh wow never heard of that in my life sorry
Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep. I was drunk!
[NAME] is a fucking retard whenever he tries to pass forward

I mean I understand the joke but are y‚Äôall actually going to he posts relating to the team
Because it's a rejection of oneself, rather than acceptance. It's an expression of insecurity. It's not healthy.
As it should be. Great.
Funny how it do
I can‚Äôt wait!!!
Thats fine as long as the creative director is still there.... Though the talent will be missed
Hope you're ok!
Policing is inherently coercive. Anyone who opposes coercive authority must by definition oppose policing.

That does make sense. Thanks.
Really wish we had got something like this!

Well I can feel it was mentally hard bringing myself to go full [NAME] and shit talking prior to the plate, but this is some cutting edge analysis.
I literally let my mouth hang open when she said that.
[NAME], I love hearing them click in the water. The sound of a healthy ecosystem.
Hey, tell her from me that her blind fear is going to kill her children or someone else's.
Oh, give me a break, it was worded like an insult, clear as a day. A mild one, but still.
They‚Äôre saying it was a sick barista
I wonder can they basejump to the bottom.
I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately
The purple ones with a kraken skeleton or whatever? Yeah, they were from the Cursed Sails campaign and are no longer available. 
I love how the girl on her phone in the background sees what happened but just doesn‚Äôt care...must happen all the time.
there is a difference between being a good villain and being insufferable. He has passed that line a few too many times for my liking
The joke is that people still do this, so it is humorous that you are implying it's a thing of the past.
I'll show some love for diazepam! Congratulations on the re up and let me Know if they are
One of the best in the series imo
Bahaha I wish! I copied and pasted it off the internet but yeah that‚Äôs some serious research
Getting upset and triggered over a hat is absolutely failed moral character, and a sign of deep immaturity. 
This guy is bigger than [NAME], maybe. But I've never heard of him.
Hope he's ok, the game needs more people with names like [NAME]
He died 4 days later of dehydration
Well Reddit frequently forgets that [NAME] was jousting with [NAME] for biggest hawk in DC.
This should be in r/amazingUK really.

Don‚Äôt spend time with someone who isn‚Äôt going to respect you as a person.
What goes up must come down.
I'm not too excited to see [NAME] and [NAME] throwback offense again. Run 3 times punt and play great defense. Zzzzzz.
> I don‚Äôt think it is intentional though. You have been banned from /r/conspiracy
Gotta love Alabama School Fundraisers. You know that dad paid big bucks with how excited he is

I feel a connection to this woman
>US isn't a de facto dictatorship Not sure anyone has told [NAME] that to be honest
Why did he think that you work there? People visit hospitals all the time.
"[NAME] damn son. the fact that you said ""re-education"" made this 5x better too lmao "
Looks like a certain someone is about to come out a certain closet
Are you sure it wasn't just the six o'clock news? Its getting difficult to tell the difference these days.
Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.
His fingers have swelled with pride.
Maybe they are jealous that you found happiness.
I wished my mom protected me from my grandma. She was a horrible person who was so mean to me and my mom.
[NAME] from ZoE and [NAME] from TTGL. Actually fuck all that [NAME] from The Big O is where it's at.

It's interesting how you're actually using type logic here.
Hey.... that's not the wallet inspector...
Can these be made so in the future it could be made even higher? Like adding an additional 15 feet or so? Would be cool...
That‚Äôs like forcing skins back in the days of MOHAA everyone is fluoro Orange! That‚Äôs what they want!
I don't know, it its fairly anti [NAME] after the bump stock ban. I'm still holding out.
That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.
[NAME] IS ABOUT TO BLOW THIS GAME UP! Edit: wow thanks for the silver
That‚Äôs amazing!!! We average 30 OTW but our half hour transaction count during peak is usually 40-55. Low volume store.
Point still stands about generalizing
True! He probably is just lonely. Thank you for the kind words :)
I seriously don‚Äôt get how these refs allow everything to go in the first half, but the slightest touch is a foul in the second. 
Thanks, I really appreciate your advice :) 
I wish I could‚Äôve had that kind of relationship with my mother.
Its like you are flexing that you have gf ,when most of people here doesnt have that feeling
Laugh and hang up. Then tell my husband that an ex from 25+ years ago just called me and spouted a bunch of nonsense.
Try to watch this without crying.
That was quite the read, very good story!
Careful, now. Suggesting this kind of dialogue at Google is what got [NAME] fired.
Lawful VS chaotic
I hope [NAME] likes my Thanos costume though.
Yeah she looks pretty cute in that pic tbh
I'm starting to wonder if these are satire... They're too hilarious to be actual conservative memes.

The summer of love, hippie, anarchy communism thing kind of fell apart here: 
In my play through she became a prostitute.
I remember the Lions under [NAME]. Just no.
I honestly don‚Äôt think of the term that often and generally use it seriously, but still use sparingly.
Now change the guys face to [NAME] and you are golden.

Welcome home, sister (assuming from your username)! May [NAME] love always burn in your heart!
That's fair, [NAME] probably is. We can never actually know who hits hardest so it's fairly moot point.

That's really good!
That's ignorant as all hell. Tell them to buy their own.
Not sure why it matters but i imagine shes as old as all the other v3 ultimates, so around 16-17
And the rest that women complain the most are still there to pump them and dump them. No matter how fast she puts out.
If he's still blaming [NAME] for his issues, the therapist is doing a bad job.
I find it really strange how people align themselves with or against a politician so strongly.
More insults, [NAME] said my bit now all you have is a show that proves what I said to be the truth, nothing more nothing less.
All the time here! Say have kid an ex wife and there poof gone!
Hang in there, we're here for you. I hope you get through this.
So if MB3 replaces WCS, who exactly do you see as the future for your forward spots?
Amazing. And heartbreaking. I'm learning so much from little bits like that.
Are those the numbers from last season? [NAME] is a significantly better player this year than he was last year
My dad did this same trick when I was a kid
Lol- nah, she is pretty cool as far as that goes. She loves hosting people. 95% of her wardrobe is [NAME] though :(

Really? wow. I just reinstalled chrome from scratch, again. So it was Ghostery that caused the full screen issues?
Best of luck with your new religion.
The making plans and then ghosting is the part I have a problem with.
Wow. That went south both times. Wanna try for a third?
The first season was excellent and two was very bad, you should try three and four though
I laughed at this harder than I'd expected to. Also, joke's on them when those turds freeze solid like everything else in the Midwest rn.
It makes me feel good. Wholesome is a very subjective thing.
Wait... today isn't April 1st...
Just watch anime,play games,watch movies or sleep. If you feel extra energetic then work out a bit. At least this is how I spend my time
Don't do that.
It's on netflix
Good luck! The life ahead of you holds 1000% more promise than the one you are leaving behind. They caused this ... not you.
Studying something doesn't make you bright. Getting a degree does.
It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
It was great but above everything else... It makes me happy to see [NAME] at the top. Werk.
Yeah it's unexpected but I have to remove this because it's not satire or gatekeeping.
They mean that too often, people would accidentally reflect. Tbh, it was pretty useless imo
AND KEEP ACKBAR
It tasted strange to me.
Truth The most occulted of all
I let my birthday come and go as quietly as possible. I'll do dinner with the family, but that's about it.
Right? The dollar values just double and two daily doubles.
Oh I'm not denying he is a scumbag who should be run out of town. Just whether this individual thing happened.
It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
Your opinion = fact, other opinions = hurt feelings. Gotcha lol
That‚Äôs what I suspected. Will be interesting to see if they can steal some wins against the top teams in the league.
So predictable. I bet the bomb is in the puck. Anyway, im exited for the [NAME] and the robot butler cameo.
Would you rather I hadn't posted this article? Don't want to talk about it?

Have you guys played Vancouver recently or has [NAME] found someone else to cut his hair?
Oh no. Your poor friend, I hope she can move past it someday. That has to be such a hard burden to carry.
The part about the size of the shit was unnessecary but appreciated.
I will pray that she (or whoever may be pressuring her into making this decision) will have a change of heart and spare the baby's life.

Because ridiculously attractive people also have self esteem issues and depression Guess what honey The world sucks for everyone There‚Äôs no escape We will all die in misery and alone
They are both just so perfect for each other
My point was that there is no good vote here. This is legislative battle over wall funding and any given vote makes sense only in that context.
So true, sometimes what‚Äôs obvious passes over our heads. Good post.
Expected that. Thanks for your valuable feedback.
I really appreciate this post. I have been having a shit day and this honestly made my night!

That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
Dude, you're being gaslit right now by someone who despises [NAME]. Save your breath.
Looks like a cool location.
If you think steamed hams is unexpected anywhere on Reddit, then I got news for you
I would love to see some encouragement and smiles on the sideline instead of yelling and whining.
Ah good ole no child left behind

People are kind of turning on it, seeing it isen't just hard, but has a lot of issues within the core design that turn people away.
Quite enjoying this tbh
Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow. 
It was in a downward trend since 9 years ago, thanks [NAME]! 
It's great that he was banned and your coworkers helped you out!! :D
It's not like other teams have been spending tons of money in the last couple weeks. Making small moves doesn't mean we can't make big moves.
Now I guess the question is, were they dipping their brush in their own paint pot, or were they sharing with a friend ?
He was a part owner but did he also make videos promoting the sites?
I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.

Powerful stuff. I'm sorry I gave you this much time and credit.
Sweet. Thanks [NAME]
Excellent use of this scene. Your skills and taste border on wizardry.
Actually if they formally organize in any way then they face discrimination charges for not including enough ethnic/ religious minorities.
I mean for once the unpopular one is actually at the top, even if it is tea, robbed of air time? Sure, wins no
Happy birthday, [NAME]! Hope you have a wonderful day!

Haha love it!
Better slap that car roof.
Man [NAME] and [NAME] are wylin
"I think you missed a ""ba"""
Girl here. I don't get why incels think that girls only like tall guys. I mean I'm 4'10 and my boyfriend is only 6'2.
You know he meant Golden Gardens. You are not discussing this in good faith.
Wrong. Im a [NAME].
Yeha he failed to qualify unfortnatwly.
I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My mom does the same anytime she loses something. She accuses people of stealing whatever she lost.
No more [NAME] from Georgia. Suck it you old, ugly hag.
Really sucks that he's not going to retire a Sounder.
I don't think pairing [NAME] and [NAME] again is that bad an idea. Also love the [NAME] idea.
Kind of like how menat enraged the average player
And a pretty bad [NAME] too.
Why it got removed.
Why should [NAME] get to pick the Democratic party candidate?
I like all Star Trek. I hope they end up switching directions now and make new movies that are more about exploration.

Anyone from this sub that's caught posting in that thread should be banned from here. And from life.

-Port will finish bottom 4 -[NAME] will be a massive let down -[NAME] will win the brownlow
Thank you for your valuable contribution to the discussion
Hope you had a great time!
If [NAME] doesn't drop a [NAME] tribute tonight in his intro I'm going to be hella disappointed.
You‚Äôre an angry elf
It's funny when a whole sub rejects any new information which doesn't fit their narrative.
Feeling the hatred towards that person I get. Actually running them off the road and holding them at gunpoint? No way. No way to justify that.
Thanks China.
Koracick. I totally know that by heart. Didn‚Äôt have to google it or anything. Totally...
I like Derek. It's on Netflix and I was crying my eyes out and laughing hysterically every single episode. I was sorry they cancelled it.

That feels nice.
Fake news! Obviously this can't be true, as everyone can clearly see the angelic halo above [NAME] head. 
You're probably joking but [NAME] has been pretty insightful regarding the yellow vests in France. I was impressed.

True but I think that's what the other poster was thinking at least
[NAME] got dragged.
Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?

Retributionist is essentially RBed with respect to Mayor now. Not a bad play at all
How is [NAME] fleshed out? His entire role in ep1 was that he cooks. He's about as important as [NAME].
Lol, that slomo
Not anywhere near caught up.
Why the fuck would I post something on r/niceguys and pretend to be the woman talking shit about myself?
ahah I hadn't even thought of it until the scenario I mentioned above, so dont feel too bad.
Nope, but is that a thing people who talk about digestive enzymes over lunch breaks should do? 
[NAME] never suited up for a Dodger affiliate.

Should have just gotten massive foundation donations and laundered the profits that way.
I identify as a person of size despite being actually smol
So, [NAME] was also paying to allow her to eat healthier. Let‚Äôs look at the bright side!

There aren't really any consequences of an alignment change.
Where is this suggestion, the only one I know is to check if you video has the dreaded yellow $ sign. 
He looks like a model tbh. Very good looking man.
But then she can‚Äôt be there for her son due to prison for battery. But it probably would be pretty cathartic

He raped her. What is wrong with you? Go back to Incels.
Maybe if we didn't choke to inferior teams we could've made the playoffs and done something about it. But of course, we didn't so.
Mmm, no. I highly dislike this. 10/10 TIHI material.
Don‚Äôt laugh the way this game went I actually expected he will lay it in... then reality and [NAME] hit... thanks goodness
Disgusting, I bet you he will never even be inside that apartment condo ever.
Cop is stupid for upholding the law, I think most people here would beg to differ but wtfdik

What prompted you to change? Just curious. She does have a tinge of perfectionism.
This converstaion reminds me of this old [NAME] cartoon. Apparently some people were upset by it.
You've violated rule 4. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.
Wait... I have been in two movies and I have played [NAME] in both.

"[NAME], what is the ""short run"" vs the ""long run""?"
[NAME] bless you. Yeah I said [NAME] because we live in America,the land of [NAME]
I love this community. These mag fest memes have been so strong.
Implying there was a shootout in the restaurant? I wouldn‚Äôt feel safe at all if I were caught in crossfire
I'm guessing that it maybe due to being overwhelmed w/ responses and having a relatively small staff to go through all the forms.
Yeah, that one. I forgot the name earlier.
Is that a real tweet? From the actual president? Not a parody? I can't tell anymore.
That‚Äôs what I meant, sorry bout that. Never fold AKs pre 
Look... they are pretending it never happened. Lol.
A complete lack of self-reflection is a prerequisite for being a [NAME] supporter.
I dont know why people are hating this so much. I guess everyone here wants to be just ok for the next 5 years
It was received on Jan 25th at 9:22 am .81627 BTC and $3800. for it with a $600. fee. Happy!
[NAME] why did they have to remove the OP? Her story is heartbreaking and she appears to only want some sort of comfort from the sub.
For Citynews dot ca that is really sad.
Actually the Bills‚Äô current uniforms make them look like the 1980-1999 Giants
This is a bit of a political post but I just felt like venting.
Shit you are right! I can't believe I forgot to mention that as well! Thanks for pointing that out ;)
I enjoyed speaking to [NAME]
Im having a terrible day and you made me laugh thank you
Lol at least stand by your dumb opinion instead of deleting it.
The nerve of that [NAME] album on his wall. I still can‚Äôt believe he has a child.
I vape myself today to see if I still feel
So? Sometimes it feels good to be petty, especially when it comes to an ex
Surely you dont think its the bravest thing a person can do though right?
How many shitposts does it take to make me unsub
Filthy. Stay there, please.
Or 800 $1 orders
Very true, interesting point of view. 
More rudeness, misogyny and sexism from [NAME]. If it wasn't so predictable it would be upsetting. [NAME]. 
Friend got me into football by watching Detroit play on Sundays after church. Been a fan since.

Don't play dumb we all know what you were implying, you racist nazi. 
Those inflated monopoly prices go back into Ontario coffers for services like roads and schools! How dare you question them. /s
LOL no its not all in the video. We have all seen the longform video now so its obvious that I was right.
Sorry to say it, but you will have to do that for now It sucks 
Congrats y'all!!!
Fantastic news for supply - hopefully it translates to less pressure on rents. This market desperately needs more supply and this is great news.
This is brilliant!
That destroys honor tho right ??
that's some nice evidence you got there.
yep he joined the wrong org
You can‚Äôt
I read TFTFD periodically, too - - I wasn't sure if the Mods there would leave the post up or tell LAOP to post on r/AskHotel instead.
One of the very few individuals to survive a shot to the head. Very unfortunate since he had a couple of more good years ahead of him.
Thank god. This place was authoritarian.
>I just hope Lovejoy is back Phrases I'd never expect to hear for $600 [NAME]
I think for some reason she thinks the money out weighs a normal childhood for her daughter.
I am sports entertained.
Because the Wizards play much much better without [NAME], thats why, they have won their last 3 games, all against playoff teams
BJJ guy isn't wrong, he's just being waaay too sincere with somebody who's taking the piss.
Lol this never gets old
R4, 9. You‚Äôve had many chances. Banned. 
You do not get my math? Because my comment and your comment are saying the same thing; women over 45 probably do not want bio kids.
I would do this job for free! /s
Annoying isn‚Äôt it! Thanks, I guess I‚Äôll have to stop responding too!
I don't remember being able to hear in those situations. I think...
if it makes you feel better I still think your a good person .
And to think all along I was wondering if it was left hand turn day or just me!
I am getting a lot of weird replies...
Thanks! I'm so keen :)
Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies
So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
This makes so much sense. Seems she has been icing me. Time to call it quits
Good video, friend
Under [NAME], in 2018, unemployment raised above 4% at least 6 TIMES---in ONE year! What exactly are the [NAME] supporting? ü§î
Why not? Just go for it. It'll make a great story to tell at your 50th wedding anniversary party.
> it's not the fault of the mods or uses of this sub. They are the people enforcing it. Why wouldn't you blame them?
Because he's a couple years older and not as good. If the trade is [NAME] for [NAME], then sure...
No, honestly. I‚Äôve never had this problem until now and I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs happening 
This must have been the fastest reply I've ever gotten omg
Thank you :)

Oh. Thanks. I was too lazy to read the [NAME] and just presented my opinion. My bad
It is awesome, and nothing turns me on more (as far as giving pleasure to my lover goes). Seriously.
> is not needed for dogs. Wrong. In *this* case it wasn‚Äôt. It very often is.
You got the kindest heart
That's what you get for not washing your mouth for months.
This is the word or at least Attitude of King. No problems man.. and have a poor grasp of the statement honestly.
I just housed a transgender person for a few months after she came out to her parrents. So people are so cruel.

The logic is so the government can oppress you.
Whhhaaa really? When was this?
It gets better! You're not alone and any progress is good progress. Always keep fighting.

Bet there are some disappointed - and yet newly disciplined - [NAME] who got tricked by that subreddit title.
Just remember to refrigerate it and not leave it out.
As long as you do the cooking by the book üòè
I was eating watching tonight's episode. OMG I never will again. You all know what I mean. The opening scene!!!
None in mine.
this makes liberals look like spoiled house cats, it's embarrassing honestly.
I've finally found my people who know the struggle.
Loooool I didn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs ridiculous
"I woulda ""sneezed"" with my drink in my hand and launched it right behind me"
The comment was so terrible. I can‚Äôt believe it made the final cut.
I'm just thinking our government sucks at Civilizations. Should have invaded them decades ago. Lots of water and farm land to use.
I immediately love your owner. Those guests sucked, but seriously your owner is awesome.
Wanna know how hard I hit it? I hit it into next week.
Lmao this is hilarious not cringe
I literally got the same bug
(apparenlty) a lawyer sending incriminating text message to a paralegal. this has to be really bad lawyer...
the fatter you are the more chance it'll stay in your fat cells and body longer than someone who's not fat. Exercise and hydration helps with this
Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??
He was playing with absolute garbage teammates, and the one year he was on a decent team he had 44 points in 48 games. 
I used to when i was younger, but then i got old and started caring about conserving water. 
If that‚Äôs what I saw when I was on the brink it would make me do it.
Sorry, I meant let them know outside of class.

Sex lesson for a 28 year old oh god, but I see the point you‚Äôre tryin make and I‚Äôll try it! 
"""Have you seen my ex girlfriend?!"" on KFC radio was the cringiest thing i've ever heard"
You called yourself a Met fan. THAT is embarrassing. Edit: called themselves a Met fan and didn‚Äôt know who [NAME] was AMD disrespected him.
Thanks for saying that, it wasn't easy ... definitely sparked a long period of discussion and reflection!
It's fine, I just don't want to take the time out of my day to make food... or wait for food.
[NAME] i was mostly curious about the background because it's very good.
Speech should be illegal if it is an incitement to violence or a call to commit crime. Everything else, however repulsive it might be, must be legal 
Interesting how the before photos are clearly yellow-tinted, as can be seen by the difference in the skin complexion 
Please tell me how you feel about [NAME] and [NAME] again once you've finish with your manufactured outrage.
When religion and flags get entwined, bad things happen.
The HMC is pretty big and they don't allow stunning.
"Except for ""fighting liberalism"". Happy cake day."
Hot damn it takes some real self-confidence to say you can't do things in MS paint
He‚Äôs such a pervert.
You can be highly educated and still incredibly ignorant.
Even in the offseason we can‚Äôt escape the injury bug :/
Can anyone confirm the [NAME] likliness? Asking for a friend.
This is amazing and terrifiying
I would have to agree. He acts for himself and wants revenge but also cares for and respects life so, chaotic neutral.
I wish AOC was old enough to run for president
What limits are you talking about? Last time i checked, [NAME] doesnt have any limits
Yes!!!!
Don't understand the question. Obviously you make up the rules in the middle of the game.
Oh la la
At first I thought it was [NAME] and [NAME] lmfao
the left platform is idealist and they don't like anything that gets in the way of the dream of the iddal
This is perfect!
This is how I think of my wife and any of her friends.
Now I remember, you're an OC student. This sub tells me you're brilliant...
You're being a total narc, bro. You're so narcoleptic.
"I see your ""making myself undateable"" and raise you a ""try to make myself as dateable as possible and still fail"""
Love the homeless encampment in the photo.
Even if they did that I think their criteria would probably be reserved for the most extreme cases.
> The parents don‚Äôt parent anymore. I am sure this fact is well referenced in [NAME] new curriculum.
He also does not care much for his mother because she knew Dr. [NAME] was lying. Just your typical leftist bully who hates his family.
My template is usually : - Sassy, back-handed or just straight-up offensive response back to them. - Walk Away.
Of course [NAME] doesn't like competition for his religious fantasies. That surprises no one.
This was literally me!
Sorry to say OP but it seems his IQ is indeed higher than yours.
Talked about our demons after watching It's Kind of a Funny Story.
I just watched the video and I don‚Äôt think that was his sister.
There's a difference between use and ownership. They aren't equivalent.
Yes, would love a list of your favorites! I downloaded the app and it‚Äôs pretty great. 
That explains why you're wearing a dunce cap and your chair is in the corner.

This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.
I'm glad to have made a bad time a little bit better. Stay safe!
Casual uber ad
[NAME] and [NAME] were my two. [NAME] :)
As I said, the justification needs to be found outside of a separate measure of support.
Imagine being triggered so hard that you ignore science and make up false claims
I like to imagine that it's just the same 2 incompetent drivers who live in the area and keep plowing into innocent cars at that one fateful intersection.
[NAME] is so good at drafting too, but he just struggles as a head coach. I‚Äôd be ok with this 
And this is why I still visit this sub...the rabbit hole goes deeper than I could have ever imagined.
"Also in response to /u/hyunL. There was. Among other things such as vocally wanting rape to be legalized, ""breeding"" farms, among other things. "
I had to click to see :)
Sometimes I wonder if people are that stupid or that malicious
A Canadian Breakfast for ‚Ç¨0?!? Unbelievable, what a world we live in.
This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
Glad to see that thoughtful doggo found a home here!
Came to say the Ravens. I always pull for them no matter what for your laid or reasons. Plus their black and purple jerseys are so nice.
I'm not falling for this again Uncle [NAME].
Awkwardly remembering all of those promises I made mid-panic attack...
My jersey has the great number 10 on it!!
Same. Thats not the usual flight path out of [NAME]. Really curious how they got this pic.
That doesn't look too bad.
Amen to that!
It kinda is. It's better that special needs kids aren't hidden and their families don't feel that it is necessary or required.
They will get the other. It's all fun and games until they noticed I was friends with a deep trust issues with humans since they were little.
Just getting your cover in aye?
Agreed, those who are waiting for their life-changing amounts to buy a home for their families just have to wait.. they are so selfish
You‚Äôre absolutely right, I‚Äôm 61 and shouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised by the arrogance that ignorance can generate.
Me: laughs in Florida.
At this point, I am completely convinced that you are either a bot, or an unconvincing alt account. Prove me wrong.
Was he the only short guy you dated?
Def not nypd lmao, but u hear you 
Excuse my wording. I should‚Äôve said [NAME] all around game & unselfishness combined with [NAME] aggressiveness & scoring
This is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much!
I'm flying home to stl tonight. Land at 8pm. Have to get all the way down 44.....fuck.

Big thanks dude! This will really help me out
Removed. Rule 4.
Tell me Homeless [NAME], what's the secert to long and beautiful hair? 
You look Beautiful! Curls are wonderful!
It really do be like that
My soul twin must be [NAME] because I‚Äôm terrified of water!
Or you could y'know just be a nice person and respect other people's opinions and likes? ^Since ^you ^clearly ^have ^plenty ^of ^your ^own
Long straight hair on the face is going to look quite odd I would guess.
That is one big pile of cringe.
I'm sorry you had to go through that. Though I'm glad you're out of that toxic environment now.
You're a big guy.
[NAME] path made me hate everything associated with pirates
> my cat needs new braces, Thank you. This made me laugh.
ok, so there are no checks client side, thanks for the information and all the best luck on the project!
So so cute she will love it so much. Trust me, little sentimental things like that mean a lot
Wear Pod. You cretin.

Haha yeah. Are the squat toilets that prevalent? I‚Äôm hoping to avoid them when I go.
Lol. Imagine dying to a floating zombie
"""but did it feel good tho?"""
What is the story behind your account name? Just curious.
Introspection? How would you personally go about that? What questions would you ask yourself?
Oh *hell* no.
Wtf is this lmao god I hate reddit
These refs are remarkably terrible tonight. So are the sabres but wow some terrible calls.
I had a friend send me a 3+ hour paranoid conspiracy documentary, zeitgeist I think it was called... Wasted 10 minutes before I noped the fuck out..
Yep. This sub is just being overly reactionary, which surprises no one.
This thing going to be a boon doggle. The last thing NJ needs is another mall.
they already ruined their own lives by having an affair. the other spouse knowing is just a consequence of their selfish actions.
Isn‚Äôt banning people for their point of view against the whole fucking concept
If you think it's a real emergency don't waste too much time and try to call the police
good luck! I wish you the best <33
Sort of weird to make kids dance shirtless for any reason
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes... looks like she braced before impact. Probably gets this shit all the time. 
And the guy getting out of the front car acting like the car doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs trying to back up, unbelievable 
Yup, it's from the latest episode. Thanks! :[NAME]!
Really well said.
Congrats to you!! So happy for you! wow socks is sooo nice!
although he is best girl, he can never love :( he litterally doesn't have a heart
The same reason that the two on the left look dead inside: They know what they are, and are wishing for the sweet release of death. 
>According to your premises, you're wrong. Harvard wants to know: your location.
Haha and [NAME] is calling the Chicago crew the most triggered bunch. Then proceeds to scream at them like the little triggered bitch he is.
Roast you? The fires of Mount Doom already did that for you, you [NAME] looking ass. 
[NAME] is the man.
"""He made her"" give me a break. Tell him to shit his pants."
"Does him ""working on it"" consist of any kind of treatment or meetings/program? "
You dropped a ‚Äòwant‚Äô in that last sentence my dude
Thank you for your advice! I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
He probably does, but people don‚Äôt speak Godlish very well.
That game hurt.
I would lol
30 people is big for you...? Dang im middle eastern and it's over 500 guests each time..
We don't know what would have happened if she'd said no, which is why most guys wouldn't ask.
I like the hints of purple
Everyone else's obsession sounds useful... I get obsessed with certain actors.
I'll try. Thank you
Good one.
I've heard this is a form of self hypnosis such kinda makes sense to me.
this was hard to watch but i‚Äôd take it over the grungy redhead talking about her full tummy ü§Æ
Oh I know. I was just pointing out that our current number one has consistency issues as well so we are used to it.
I actually found mine today! I will give it to my 1 year old
Yep, minimizing massively
I'm glad you managed to find your own fun and most probably made a big contribution for this great ending. The whole masked rogue idea was amazing
I remember the last protest we hid against these guys. Scum bags
This is not a good relationship. It doesn't seem like she is ever good to you, only manipulative.
She's not. She's not in any place. She doesn't exist.
I deleted my facebook completly
Lmao we really tried that again
My gpu is fried so I'm not able to play most mmos, but I can play Project Gorgon and Wurm Unlimited on low graphics settings. 
I agree. You‚Äôll need to ask the school when you interview.
Hot dang, this almost makes me want to go to the dentist. 
FYI: Time in Europe works the same as in the State. We do not have 'weird time'
nah he only had one good year really
Doing the bus story would be interesting-- perhaps interviewing some drivers who have encountered a ghost.
She looks so much better. She really is pretty.
I wanna take the hardware out of that guy's face with a pair of pliers.
DON‚ÄôT VOTE EAT TRASH DO DRUGS GET CASH EAT ASS DIE FAST THE FUCKING MOTTO BORN TO DIE THE WORLD IS A FUCK
Because deep down you know that you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Be grateful someone told you.
This isn't cringe at all. He's making a joke.
I love that you have such a great relationship with your brother. Your parents seem pretty great too; if a bit exasperated by you in particular : )
Goddamn. I'd tap the fuck out if I was that other guy.
More please!
He most likely saw you and just didn‚Äôt care. Sadly.
And if that's the case then there is no helping him. It sucks that those people can't be helped
You don't have a Mrs do you?
Maybe I should tell my family to move the Lavvo further south =) people sound nicer there
Wonder no more, this is coming out like next year
"Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to achieve a political goal. [NAME] has not used violence.
[NAME] has had a great game so far. Really promising.

Trae getting where he wants whenever he wants, that‚Äôs all that matters
I dont see a blue line connecting them i see each mine has a little line coming out but on my screen they arent touching
Also shout out to [NAME] for continuing his hard work and not giving up!
He sounds like a real piece of work. Get him gone and live your life free of his physical and mental burden.
So I said earlier that this team was boring without [NAME] lately. I take that back after the last two games.
They just happen to let them in to their house...Yeah, no sane person does that. 
Sir that is a popular opinion. I'm too afraid of what sort of trade will happen to want one.
I guess the answer is pretty obvious too lol. It would be silly if you posted ‚Äú[NAME] too...‚Äù the bucs?
Lots of physical intimacy and sex almost every time we met. Never suspected that this would ever become a problem.
None of the movies deserve it and honestly the oscars are a sham at this point.
Is that how you deal with people you disagree with? Nice personal fantasy you have there.
damn he took my diamonds and all my emeralds smh.
oh im wiaitin.
How so. What is the basis for your feeling of universal entitlement?
You're not wrong. Hahaha
"> I don't see how a business can ""block"" "

haha someone's gotta rep for our struggling sports programs
It seems hazy, and there‚Äôs been conflicting messages
What does Obamacare have to do with that? [NAME] dropped the employer mandate because he was afraid that [NAME] wouldn't like it.
Lmao this article is almost a year old. Yawn.
...this magical creation I believe was called the ‚ÄòCheezboiga‚Äô pizza. Oh and that‚Äôs not hot sauce.. it‚Äôs ketchup.
Implying you didn‚Äôt cry over [NAME]
Take on me time!
No it's not crazy , there are parts the we still don't understand but for the most part everything mades logical sense.
Same with [NAME]. I was even disappointed Parks and Rec had newt gingrich on for a cameo.
Loved it!
15 years is over 25% of the Superbowl era. That's far from nothing.
[NAME] is on fire!!!
Please leave this dude
Someone who believes oil is a miracle cure all.
This is really helpful to point out!!
Maybe Streamlight Strion if OP wants something Fenix PD35 sized? Havent used one myself but have heard good things.
Wtf? Really?
Me for the last 3 years lol
with his luxurious salary, nice pension and zero accountability for anything it does, its a hard old life!!!
I'll have some wasabi with tapeworms tonight thanks.
HE SHOOTS AND SCORES!!!!
stop hurting my feelings
Shocking isn‚Äôt it
I had 'tacos de cabeza' in Mexico ‚Äî \x62\x65\x65\x66 head. All sorts of interesting bits like cheek, tongue, brain. Delicious. 
Oh bb please tell me about possible sanctions
What a homie.
Haha oops **amiodarone. This is why we need safety checks for drug orders. ;)
Sorry to hear about that! Are you just under observation? Any anti-clotting drugs they're pushing?
Oh ok. I'll go check them out :)
Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all.
That's a cool dino
Yup I picked $30,000 just because. 
This is it thank you so much
Mmmm, I haven't had dinner yet and it's been a while since I've ordered Thai...
...and show some respect to her parents!
It's a shitty made shirt but if it was done well I'd wear it.
Didn‚Äôt see anything about exercise or nutrition in there. Shits important
My husband‚Äôs mental health issues caused our divorce. If you need a friend or a listening ear, pm me. I hope things improve!
Thanks! I like your advice. I'm a mom too. I was even smaller after she was born than before my pregnancy. Weirdness.
Cause this isn't a woman its a dude :D
* [NAME] fought for freedom and glory, is one of my favorite characters in general.
I think it depends on how many people are awake and passing by at the time of the posting.
yeah and I;m getting ready to eat fries with ranch!!!
üëç excellent! I was wondering if anyone else knew this little known nugget from history.
The last thing you wanted for your child, but they inevitably choose it. Funny that.
I do this too! I love that giving a genuine compliment is easy and can make someone's day :)
I want to make friends too :( but I feel like I have nothing good to offer
Hey congrats!! That's amazing, you've done such amazing progress! Hope you have a great day :)
You got me. Now gimme the downvotes I DESERVED
Looks like you just finished eating a shit covered ass.
Safe to say we‚Äôre out of adjectives for him now
When I was in 3rd Grade, I wanted to sneak into my pregnant teachers house and make her drink beer.
Our crust is way too active for that.
We talk about PizzaGate too Why doesn't CNN cover Israeli interference in US elections? CNN seems to be aiding and abetting Israel in their meddling in US politics
Dyscalculia. It's not that uncommon, especially in people with ADHD.
Heart races everytime I get a match. Oddly enough I don't feel that at all playing offline with my friends.
[NAME], that was 2013? Time flies
Ahhhh BURN üî•
I read this In his singing voice. Amazing.
I‚Äôm just afraid of the reaction. But I know you‚Äôre right.
Me too.. which left me conflicted about how to feel.
I love it. I just joined the Streetwise Facebook page to catch up on some of the kids.
If you want a one minute story told in half an hour then ask [NAME] to tell it.
Its the same AS to go to a bank and to say My kid loves money give him all of it
I loathe the unsolicited comments I get about having kids someday. The closest thing I could find to getting my tubes tied is my 10 year IUD.
Thanks. People need to calm down and give QCX a little time here.
And the healthy snacks are on their way!
A Wall is NOT a Volition of the NAP you idiot.
Oh nice, VB using him as their own populist tool to grab the attention of the overtly racist and scared of brown people.
I can safely and honestly attest that I have had *nothing* to do with any disappearances of any sort. ~~[NAME] has already touched the reply button.~~
I'd rather watch [NAME] chuck threes
Minke whale have never been endangered and are delicious imo. Particularly minke whale carpaccio
Ok thanks ‚ù§‚ù§
Lol ya mom
I agree, there‚Äôs no salt on that pretzel...monstrosity!
Thank you. So many people out there that would rather be right and in a grave than swallow their pride and do the safer thing.
Love me some FA cup
Clean break. Easier to not obsess when their life isn‚Äôt being thrown in your face.
I am so very, very happy at your last sentence. If you understand that, you will be permanently free.
what a dumb moment of faux outrage. can't wait to see what contrived outrage someone thinks up next.
No its an edited one by someone on this sub, I can't find it though. 
That looks amazing
Eating isn't a 'Healty coping mechanism', stop lying to yourself.
It's this kind of fear that made me make this
[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] big 4 >>>
Why or when was he ever a locker room cancer though? Am I missing something? Thanks for the downvote for asking a question, though. 
You have inspired someone to create something that is liked by others. Is v nice feel.
Definitely, I also get suspicious when someone tries to be my friend which doesn‚Äôt help
The hero we didn't deserve ,but the hero we needed.
Probably looks more like the walls of any room you've inhabited for more than 10 seconds.
Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. 
I don‚Äôt even try to make shots like this myself. So I gotta watch other people make them.
A track would be much more suitable for this kind of recklessness! Keep this kind of dangerous driving off of public roads!
Do you fucken mind
Yep, especially if the mob on reddit is any indication of the group-think that‚Äôs going on in 2019.
[NAME]. Yeah, right. Lol
Ah, i misunderstood what he was going for, sorry my bad
Is that your quote? Either way, I'll add this to my collection.
How DARE you!
Or they just don't understand why cats do that with kittens.
You're not getting more benefit, you're getting the same insurance plan, it just costs more.
Lets see if [NAME] cares about playing hard in [NAME] return to LA. I think we can win if our players actually play hard and care.
Posts like this depress me severely. I pray to [NAME] my kids don't live with me until they are almost 30.
You really dont have a day off do you
"Just ""asking for a friend""...huh? üòÇ"
Does that have any bearing on as to why cats are preferred over dogs?
Yes I do mean it positively and I have used a sous vide and it does come out looking rare
Would you move your car if told not to drive?
You contradicted yourself
[NAME] living in y‚Äôall heads rent free lol. It‚Äôs kinda sad ngl. EDIT: Thanks for proving my point, guys üòòüòòüòò
they called me after 2 days lol
He'll be the difference maker in the playoffs. He can get any shot he wants because of his all time great ball handling
If we go anything but line I‚Äôll be irate.
It's ok to debate and reevaluate scientific things. Really it is. Scientism however is the idiology, religion, that useful idiots and politicians are pushing.
Destroyed property is the same as lynching someone for their race.
"""I didn't learn anything from the last short clip video on twitter that cut in mid way through an confrontation"" Oh look a new one!"
VP pick guaranteed - and the pivot will be hilarious
Gotta protect‚Äôem!
If that's true OP, you've lived quite a sheltered existence.
Any particular reason or just because it seemed redundant?
Yeah, right. [NAME] can marry [NAME] for that matter, as it seems only his genius is keeping her on the throne.
Life imitates art.
i definitely remember the times i embarassed myself or regrettable actions i made from years ago
I messed up by trying the sweetened tea. Maybe tea just isn't my thing? Either way, nice to have the choice be my own. [NAME]
Depends on the drug. Weed makes me antisocial and when I'm in public, I feel paranoid and I feel like everyone knows I'm high.
That‚Äôs how it be
[NAME] wasn't accused of sexual assault
Mid game? I was worried it would happen to me except reverse. Hold out on this contract for another hour haha
$9?! Yeah you git ripped off, hope you kept the receipt pal r/sarcasm
great show.
I think that's more a matter of character's personalities, I think, more than development. But for the rest, I agree. 
Just put it on your penis soft and then you will grow into it
Welcome back.
I‚Äôm excited!
No one cares
Uh eat less than you burn per day. Eat a lot of protein.
Not gonna bother reading that you're not gonna change my mind lol

So I'm being unsafe. I'll work on that, thanks.
Thank you for being the voice of reason in here while people keep screaming about the Vatican's thousand-year old wall.
>ultra-conservatives Um excuse me, I'm actually a Plus Ultra Conservative, thanks!
I take showers at night and I desperately need one atm. My hair has been really greasy recently.
Thank you so much I'm going to start it right after the Golden Globes!
Enough shit comes out of his mouth, do we really need to put more back in?
Lmao ‚Äúnow everyone *has* a job‚Äù
I like spicy, but I have made poppers with mini bell peppers and they came out great. Good to have options
[NAME] line of drool made me very happy I waited to watch this til I was eating dinner i love the power hour so much
> mined the worldwide largest block It was orphaned, so no they were unsuccessful, even when they filled the block with their own hidden txns.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not happening right in front of me if I don‚Äôt look at it.‚Äù

I don't even really like Papa Johns, but I'm starving and that looks amazing right now.
This is amazing. Thank you for posting the link.
Eat my fuck- [NAME]

I still defend the evening gown .. that purple and that wig were right
I bet he doesn‚Äôt line up for Daniels Donuts
Correct What the fuck is the AAF is what im asking.
Thanks! I'm going to Middlebury this fall but that's going on my resum√© for the rest of my life tbh
As was doctors learning that they needed to wash their hands, period.
Not even slightly.
Haha! Yeah scentsy is terrible!
Happy to be able to help.
> I miss frequent, monogamous sex enough that I miss a relationship very much. This is really the core of why I want a relationship.
Because I was with someone who accepts cheating as an acceptable form of behavior.
Damn you two need help
I‚Äôve thrown up
Back to back against Nashville and Vegas. Fuck I love this team.
I appreciate the honesty! If you don't mind me asking, what state do you live in?
That looks pretty cool
Sell high!
You can't just assert that something came from nothing, you need to provide evidence for said claim.
I had so many avatars named after Star Wars characters on Millsbury. I miss it üò≠üò≠üò≠
Now i need an island visit and a nice beef dip from the Crown and Gate!
What an idiotic thing to say.
Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. 
I love it. This made me smile so much, which is a big change from [NAME] which made me cry and further increase my depression.
Someone please make a gif of [NAME] smile after that 3
wow that's amazing. i wonder what that feels like
Have you tried warm tea with honey?? That always helps my kids throats when they are sore!
[NAME] in the highest!
I think this does help less good pupils to learn it better and agree with the teachers. In my class thats the biggest problem when it comes to french
is [NAME] coming back?
I feel safe around you is a nice one
I think they are leaving it up because they know they can't delete it.
It seems the doctors have some explaining to do.
Damn MLM at its worst
oh that's sexy
Those damn tires
He'd hate me. My standards are even higher.
I love this post. Are you with park services?
Even with their new location around the corner, they are still incredibly awful. By far the worst [NAME]. 
The one where MIL flooded the whole house
Just 1 DC tonight I think
I don't mind helping people but often the problems seem so petty and small and the solution is so simple.
For some reason I read that in [NAME]' voice lmao
thank you in turn! :D
I love you, as a feminist with ASD words are very hard for me and you described this so well
This is what I'm currently dealing with and I'm glad I read this. Nice reminder thank you lol.
Edited because my kneejerk response was kind of unnecessarily harsh. :/
Welcome to the family! Don't let toxic fans, especially Twitter, get the best of you. Let's go canes!
That‚Äôs awesome! Hopefully the sanity keeps up
I know, right? Burger King is clearly superior. No wonder he is FA.
I heard the same thing after she had made false allegations and tried to hoover me back . Its so triggering now .
JACKPOT!!!
Who‚Äôs that cutie
Not just a faux pas, it's outright rude and inconsiderate.
If we were in the same city we could've hung out. Happy new year to you. You're not alone in being alone.
do it bro, get some practice in, she can teach you alot
I'd really like to see one of these red-striped zebras.
Hey! That‚Äôs my name!
You don't want a mature discussion. You want to attack children.
you couldn't make a more unsubstantiated claim even if you tried
i never thought i would read the phrase 600 lb cinematic universe but i am glad i did
Look at the spine on that kid - he must get it from his mother!
dxm increases both cardio and body heat. so you should try to stay cool and dont exert yourself
[NAME] because he's the better player.
This thread is loaded. Never seen so many coins exchanged at once :) it's nice to see friendly internet interactions.
It‚Äôs the heavy sack. He‚Äôs too clogged up from sitting there too long.
Ah ok, that makes more sense. I don‚Äôt think most [NAME] would see your last name and try to make it French, lol.
I think it‚Äôs because his contract hasn‚Äôt been finalized yet. Could be wrong, but saw a tweet about it today. 
I‚Äôm sorry friend. I actually used to be pretty good with this but I‚Äôm constantly getting worse.
I am always hungry. I do not know fullness. No matter how much I eat.
Yeah I tried to apply but with being partially excepted I think it would be hard to be a sub
I wish non-BPD people understood the pain of a relationship ending like we do. It's crippling and lasts forever.
So glad you are safe. It looks like icy conditions, too, so that is great that you were able to avoid this.
Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
I'm sitting at 7.5 Do I do it?
the force awakes wasn't a clear insult, it was just mediocre.
[NAME] is known to make a short video hella fucking long. Not many want to see even more people do that. I'll stick to [NAME].
We do what we must because we can
Don't worry. r/fireemblem is obligated to bash fates whenever it can [NAME] I love the entire scene so much. ~~Too bad it ruined the song~~
I think it's kind of cute. Someone give her a megaphone, she's a gift for the GOP.
Are we in agreement that this would be out of bounds if true?
I agree with everything you said. I still fell sad for her but this is the consequences of her own choices
"Lol thanks, yeah you need to ""legitimize"" the being hacked part and build from there. "
Competent, maybe, but erratic, unpredictable, and somewhat homicidal. 
lol the zoomed in crotch on the right
Huh, and all these years I‚Äôd been *assured* ‚Äúnobody‚Äù was coming to take my guns. Its like they been lying the entire time.
Neither does anyone in Congress. Don‚Äôt act like the [NAME], [NAME] or other are much different than him. They only care about power
Who would have thought people were going to be using the Padres for their fake news to generate clicks. This is nuts.
If we're bullies, what does that make police who actually arrest people for rape and pedophilia? The final boss?
Shits me no end mate, good on you for doing something
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it
doesn't the fact that it was used for general studies prove my point :) (and i think we're around the same age)
Good for you- take it to the next level! Congratulations
I like seeing this. There is hope. I want to hug this guy. He'll be allright.
Yeah the lack of visibility of the survey likely means the survey is gonna be skewed towards people who are extremely online on this sub specifically.
Halakhically it appears that they didn't have a problem with it. Halakhically I have a problem with it.
Youve missed everything.
Its had enough of this life and ending it all.
It had its flaws but I thought it was enjoyably campy and a fun ride.
8 hour old spam account of the forum incel buttcoin troll.
Not watched it yet pal. You?
If everyone is wrong I'll still point out that everyone is wrong, doesn't matter.
I'm not sure how is this as big an issue as you put it up to be.
Looking forward to seeing these people have their characters die in sudden and extravagant ways.
Your friend rich af
Yay twinsies! SAHM here too, in the midst of summer holidays at the moment. It's rough.
He is a moron.
She's probably had to delete it all now the police are involved, they will be using it as evidence 
Write a reply by all means, but be gentle and respectful.
We don't deserve sex with dogs.
Looks like they‚Äôll need to head to Turkey next, considering religious [NAME] love their ‚Äúgrave worshipping‚Äù The irony is rich 
[NAME], that fucking sucks.
as someone who is a big save the earth guy this is truly awesome and makes me proud to be a fan of the yankees
Stay strong [NAME]
Then watch the American remake and weep
Haven't you heard? This one game literally decides if we are good or bad.
It does not mention the Har Habayis and given the contextof the Psalm, I don't see why it wouldn't refer to the First Temple.
Don't call this baby a jerk It just loves its humans too much
Thanks. Didn't quite catch all that.
8 years ago a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of a friend very seriously said we should nuke Compton. One guess who is a rabid [NAME] supporter now.
> Origin Peak is a volcanic island less than 2000 years old! Volcanoes can appear VERY quickly...
Thanks I hate that comment
It was a joke long before the meme haha
You have to be trolling because I doubt you‚Äôre this dumb.
Human nature also leads us to greed, violence and aggression. Natural doesn‚Äôt equal good. Cancer is natural.
It's fucking laurel you god damn yanny hearing fascists.
Just for recreational use? Glad you are having a change of mind though
That or spot up shooting. I like the confidence though, he‚Äôs not scared to expand his game.
"""That's impossible."" ""It's necessary."" If they were aiming to make a [NAME] a steely-eyed missile man, they succeeded. "
Considering how much they project and accuse how often they others of only hating X person because of their race, it makes sense.
[NAME] damn cummonists
EDIT: wrong link sorry here‚Äôs the right one I hope
Ever since I could squat, deadlift, and bench more than my father he never questioned my decision. haha
Thank you, I have received help already. 
Such a lovely username for such a nice guy
I used to work with a guy that was always whining how tough his life was. My family this, my friends that. Very annoying
Trailers? We don't need no stinkin' trailers!
Praying yea hope so
Ugh there is no escape...
Yea even I felt those rocks.
[NAME] knew [NAME] were meddling tho
I guess it's the word 'high'
Thats nice to hear, glad I could help.
Daddies little nightmare
That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe.
I love it (Blacklock holiday)
I think we need to start coming to grip with the true that TWOW and the series will not be completed.
Presidents using these robots will loose all legetimacy. They will become dictators. People should invest in good cameras to document the events and share it everywhere.
I read that whole thing, so damn funny. But seriously, all those guys need to be sterilized.
Just be glad he didn't make you wear it.
Not sure I understand, the legion is in a pretty good place right now in terms of their power
Even his practice kick on the ice timeout barely squeaked over from just 43 yards
That one pesky drop of water was in it for the long haul.
For some reasons [NAME] has never had a bad tank line... Runner is onto something
Wow, well I think that game just aged me 5 years...
He looks like his parents are blood related.
Future is bright to me!
> they look like such fucking OCs. [NAME] designed them I don't know what you expected. He phones in video games all the time.
"Haha ""like a snake on a toddler"". "
Fair. Actually fuck the last few songs on Bleach.
I cannot answer this question without asking you to read a specific book.
That would be cool
Sounds really boring so I hope you like it
Y‚Äôall out here really believing this and I think that‚Äôs the funniest part
Sometimes to do what's right we must give up the thing we want the most... even our dreams.
##**IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD**
At the time, pregnancy out of wedlock was a stoning for having extra marital sex. 
Well if you refer back to my original reply to you that should be clear, really. 
Foreign mor lil boreign
Good stuff man. Love the passion.
More [NAME] leaving the knicks in a scumbag way (yes im salty about something that happened before i was born)
Get off the fence, Switzerland
OwOpen up dis is da powice!
Until that plant dies because you just shocked the hell out of its root system.
That thigh gap not cute at all
I don‚Äôt know why but this made me crack up so hard!
If you can keep it from going out / someone putting you out, yes. 
I'm shocked! Shocked! Well, not that shocked.
That's only slightly less clean.
Well isn‚Äôt it pretty much just standard goblin lore? Not like she came up with gold/ greedy goblin background on her own.
[NAME] tattoos were specifically design to augment his physique. This guy looks like his little sister scribbled on him while he was asleep.
That‚Äôs cool. I had a few baby teeth dipped in gold and made into charms for a bracelet. Gorgeous work.
HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø I think its cool.
On pace to lose home ice advantage.
Holy shit.....just holy shit
This is why I love Reddit.
Funny.. I mean real funny looking.
It defiantly shapes up the picture.
Devils fan here: how good is [NAME]? I'm watching this game and was wondering how he's been and what his potential is
These are the signs I'm getting old... Wtf is a weed cartridge??
Oh we know
I know I‚Äôm late, but happy cake day :D
Well, username checks out I guess.
Thank you for that. I just want to feel safe secure and loved just once.
I hope it was somebody else's.
She had the glory of being a virgin martyr. Eternal glory is hers.
Triggered much druggie? Lol
It's a decent flick. Id watch it
No idea man. Go check that one ‚Äústudy‚Äù done thirty years ago where you got that 40% from.
There is no such thing as a species that is not evolved yet. By definition, all species are evolved.
I enjoy BOG and Italy at Epcot. But that‚Äôs just me. Also, probably better going to Golive Arden. 
Pull that sucker right up to your face
You thought wrong. Also, the answer is Caribbean Splash Car Wash on Clarksville Pike. I'm not even kidding.
) /sorry, the Excel formula part of my brain was driving me insane.
Eh I kinda won't him less now. I like the chase
Thank you Burger King! Source
Sorry actually [NAME] runs this one. [NAME] runs the daily wire. Also I didn‚Äôt see anywhere in there where she said that
That and losing [NAME]. The two of them had instant chemistry. Excited to see is he can become a big part of our offense next year.
This is r/tifu. If you're not caught jacking it into the turkey, you're doing it wrong. 
Good job fatty!
What a loon
Hahahah thank you so much, username does not check out, you don't seem sketchy at all! üòÖ
Yes, I remember when I said that. Thanks for the reminder! 
Smoking kills you!! It is bad for you!!!!
Plus they might still be salty about the prison colony debacal.
What reason do you have for not already having been prepared?
The most irrelevant comment award..... goes to..... no one else but you.
If they wanted to help, they'd do the smallest bit of research and see that it's a horrible thing to say.
It sounds like you project a lot of anger...maybe letting things go, relaxing and slowing down is your solution.
What then is a good outcome vs a bad? Never mind I get it I‚Äôm dumb....
They‚Äôre letting teams get away with murder then they call [NAME] for that little touch foul. I don‚Äôt get officials.
Yeah feel bad for people paying 200 to watch this crap. Better hockey watching my sons novice games.
If they actually want to prevent abortions, they should be fighting for universal healthcare, comprehensive sex ed, and civilized parental leave policies.
I‚Äôm The Avocado‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Damn how do you post something directly to the front page?
Neither of them looked good in the grimes beef lol
Ahhh I misread your comment as ‚ÄúIf I noticed a car on a flat bed with no straps.‚Äù
What an incredibly well thought out response, totally related to the character and moves that were previously being discussed
Hah, serves him right.
You can tell it‚Äôs an Aspen tree because of the way it is.
Let's us both hope you will be losing it come by the end of the September then... LOL It would be freaking awesome if it happens.
Nice try. That doesn‚Äôt work though.
Surely a regime that would kill millions of people wouldn't *dare* tell a lie.
do you even need to ask of course we need to support her if we dont who the hell will?
Good for you man. Enjoy.
Blue Cheese is about as close as my lips and tongue are going to come to pronouncing that. lol
I have that problem myself sometimes.
I adore Brutus and Pixie!!
Weirdly enough Salad Fingers is one of [NAME] weaker animations, highly recommend ‚ÄòThe Unfixable Thought Machine‚Äô
A car. Let someone else eat the immediate depreciation and break it in for you.
"Last game I think someone said it well, ""[NAME] like a toddler in an NBA Pro's body. "

Ha! Getting him back with his own schtick!
He downloaded Wealthify
Just called, only one left, it's on hold for some fella named [NAME].
>he's also super handsome *( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)*

Love it.
Man I love that flair.
Thank you for this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü¶µüèº
>...fresh fruit and fish. Sounds like paradise!
CIA and MIC are now controlled by women. And nothing will change. Progress!
[NAME] said the GOP is the most dangerous organization in human history
what app is this? i see the layout every now and then i‚Äôm just curious
Try it sometime man. You may just enjoy it
Thank you. I'm just so shocked that this is in Arizona. This looks like it belongs somewhere completely different.
Fair enough. That is a form of cuckery I cant approve of.
I like [NAME] so far, but I know I'm alone in that.
I‚Äôm tired of these stupid posts. Stop trying to become a meme. You‚Äôre ruining this sub!
She must have a very boring life
It‚Äôs nice to know that no one cares enough to send me either.
I dont mind these people dying, what bothers me is that some random bystander could be smashed by this guy should he fall
I reccomend this! I
One of the best hats I own is a freebie from a Dallas Stars game. Not a Stars fan but shit it‚Äôs comfortable and fits well.
If I can be a racist against whiteys, I'd be one. TERFcide and Mayocide.
I can't believe [NAME] is considered an mua and he can find match his foundation lmao
It‚Äôs still undeniably them though. Drawn in the foreground in somewhat true color to make sure it‚Äôs a clear homage.
You serious?
C‚Äômon, you know the DJ isn‚Äôt watching the game lmao 
[NAME] still pulling in the numbers. Doubt we'll ever see [NAME] on PPV again but [NAME] is still a draw with the right opponent
I HATE that song...I did not vote for it. A few of my songs I liked went at around 60-70
Sexual frustration.
[NAME] is definitely out of frame lol
Thanks im going to get that on a shirt u are awesome and must love everyone thanks for the help [NAME] is still president
Is that why I didn't like the show? Am I too happy?
Ok, care to elaborate on what your mysterious link is?
It's fucking incredible how many people would like you if you would just make eye contact and smile at them. Fucking incredible
Can I see the video with these two? For... research
I dunno. Seems pretty meh
She loves it. Watch Rick and Morty. Do it yourself.
Bad timing for [NAME] to say this just now.
I waited outside tj outside for 10 min and did my whole shopping experience in a wine that started at the beginning of the store
She represents window licking retards.
If you don't enjoy watching sonicfox compete can you really be a fan of the competitive scene?
HAHHAHA thats good
>No but I know that fat ass just says [NAME] man bad lol [NAME] is pretty fat. Good observation.
I was pointing out the irony of [NAME] comment.
He believed Ireland had a right to exist, he just didn‚Äôt believe in the way the IRA(1919-1921) went about their business. 
it's common that Syrian AA continues shooting long after an attack is over for whatever reasons
Still awesome. I skateboard, ride bikes, and hang out with my friends. Edit: I'm 40
In a thread about six right wing American terrorists you managed to call leftists the violent ones. Incredible.
So you just don't believe we should have non-profit organizations. I guess that's consistent at least.
Kick him out. Overgrown baby.
Ah. I thought you meant ads in general. Sorry, bud! 
Maybe she‚Äôll think it was cute how shy you were
I'm sorry *what*
"Why does your flair say ""Wasted Energy""? "
You're really just having a field day today huh?
Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
Did you know the origin the first time? I don‚Äôt find it very funny in the absence of knowing that.
I agree she‚Äôs not fat, but that is Photoshopped and posed into oblivion.
He need a freak
The only thing we feel entitled to is privacy and and being free from the harassment of incels like you.
Trouser maidens üòÇ omg I love it.
Happy birthday!
I graduated in 2002 and had history books that ended with [NAME] 2nd term. I had great teachers but terrible materials.
The first guy? I think he‚Äôs just not [RELIGION]. Could be an atheist, [NAME], [NAME]; lots of things.
I‚Äôm so sorry the internet has inconvenienced you
The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.
Wow! I didn't even know there was a handball world championship.
GOW always had combat challenges, they just inegrated it more seemlessly this time, instead of having it in a seperate mode in the menu.
Just a reminder in case anyone forgot that UGA got embarrassed by Texas:
Do you read any of the content on this sub? Lol. Because it contains very specific detailed critiques and concerns that you're conveniently ignoring...
I scrolled past this and thought this was a title reveal and got so excited. Good GOOD theory though!
felt that so hard too
Is it weed? I‚Äôm curious to ask if you know what weed smells like?
At least you can't be strangled with a mobile phone.
I'm so glad I grew up playing a shooter made for kids rather than a shooter made for kids.
Refrigerators? That's cool
Welcome to Utah and good luck. Your wife should consider looking for jobs at Weber state. Both of you would be within a 20 min commute.
Poor Guy. Come back stronger than ever!
That guy is gonna regret losing you the rest of his life. You know why i know this? Because i am him 30 years ago.
Unfortunately no one usually fights for their rights without a martyr
Sounds epic man
You're such a good troll. Good job! Way to really get into that part. You nailed it!
üòÇ i need one too i‚Äôm on break and honestly my life revolves around reddit at this point, cake day is special enjoy it! 
It's legal...
"Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody.. Probably more or less amatur x'D"
at least you‚Äôre getting hit on
I enjoyed [NAME] intermission report where he was very low energy until the end when he squeaked out a HI MOM =D because he's the best
Thank goodness I‚Äôm safe. Don‚Äôt sound so disappointed.
I wqs explqining my problems and my past to him, sort of venting, and that's when he offered.
Was she immunosuppressed in any way?
> If you hear something three times you are eighty percent more likely to believe it than if you only hear it once. Source?
Gas Crisis. It‚Äôs the best episode of all time.
OH MY GOOSE! You got my super obscure reference! I literally squealed out loud when I read this comment.
Oh no! I'll check into it; there are transcripts available, but it isn't really the same thing, is it? 
PLEASE leave my Mother out of this!
There is no doubt in my mind that [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] will start tomorrow. Unsure about the rest
‚ÄúIf something doesn‚Äôt affect me, it‚Äôs not important‚Äù
Omg I love it
Ugh. I just hate seeing this name :(
Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.
Because lowest price technically acceptable is in the best interest of the government *Eye twitches* ^^^*help* ^^^*meeeeee*
Well done OP for acting on your words. I hope you have a great day together!
Context is lost in the article, no way to know how it was asked or how the person was behaving.
Subscribed! I love it.
You should definitely stop using to meet men!
Some bioshock shit right here.
And that was more or less the manager's position on it. He was obviously trying very hard not to call her stupid to her face.
Injuries will not knock us out of the running.
But there's no hype in that...
Yeah no problem. Here is the link to her sons foundation.
It's fairly modern.. It opened in 2007.
Well they got removed so I‚Äôm not sure if I want to see it anyway.
No kidding. That was extremely disappointing.
U guys are super cute together.
You made eye contact. Or flinched. Or were just alive and walking down the street.
He overachieved my expectations this year. I hope he tops this years performance next year. Go Gmen!
Those charts seem to indicate approximately a net 4000 advantage for [NAME] over the period considered.
Is this the best that you could come up with?
Looks like a bookshelf to me
He needed to have sex with [NAME] to complete his mission, duh!
Lol, right? Who says that before banging? ‚ÄúIs you ovulatin?‚Äù SOOOO repulsive. ü§Æü§Æ
Have a wonderful day.
Me too. One of my favorite potential Dem candidates
We love you here.
Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.
Oh, [NAME]. Oh, oh, oh, [NAME]. 
And why are they trolling i. The first place? Care to exain the reason?
i used to do this a lot when i was younger lmao glad to see my vision wasnt just mine
> I cannot fathom what he gets out of it. The privilege of avoiding any and all self-reflection, I guess.
Holy [NAME], our hope and handmaid of the [NAME], pray for us!
[NAME]* I'm not mad, just dissapointed.
The one coach I didn't want to lose, but with a new offense coming in, not a move i'm entirely shocked by. 
Nice little train journey. Come on everyone, shower up before the tour
This post should demonstrate that it already has become one of those subs. Disingenuousness is rampant here
Thank you destruct
Did you check the bowl?
> we get a minimum of $11 Wow that's pretty generous, no wonder people don't need to tip.
I‚Äôve never seen the reverse tbh. All the brown guys I know get absolutely no hoes and just orbit women for life.
Oh my, it belongs to r/comedyheaven. Laughed for a good minute
Certainly possible. I think you can wait until 15 but that's just a gut thing.
People will stop wanting to punch/jail these people when they stop being ignorant, selfish pricks putting newborn babies at risk.
Even farting after I shower makes me want another shower
Can't believe everything you see on the internet eh?
Cheers, I live minutes away from you, will check it out some time soon.
I like [NAME], just thought there was significant savings there, and maybe sign [NAME] for cheaper...idk
What she is doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Fight with everything you have to protect your kids. 
This is how I know I'll have a good time!
It's wonderful because it's awful. At not with.
What, we are all gonna be corpses soon. Do I become that sooner?
sorry im deaf i can‚Äôt hear you
‚ÄúRegain the fan base‚Äù. How immature do you have to be to believe that everyone agrees with you.
It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
I continue to sub here only because your quips make me laugh
I flew off the handle and that's my bad.
Medley? ü§Æ
Must be a tough life when all you can think about is sad stories to keep you from enjoying anything.
What media is this scene from?
Honestly- my period stopping is one of my favorite ‚Äúold lady‚Äù things! Ha!
My nipples are rock hard right now, just ruined my shirt. 
21 year olds thriving for lower table clubs are usually interesting to bigger clubs. Will be interesting to see how he does.
Yea I'm poor :(
same i feel u
This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
Best! Episode! Ever! There is like a joke every 20 seconds.
would love to see a win here
Thx! Keep waiting for her to take over and say NERF THIS
[NAME] and [NAME] have said peach is by far bowser‚Äôs worst MU in the past. They discuss it in this thread:
d'oh, my bad üòî
I am really excited for you! We texted a few weeks before we met too! The first hugs and kisses were the best!
I will say, this tanking season is a lot more enjoyable than [NAME] cause we don't see [NAME] looking confused on the sideline every game.
I think he meant shinobi slide
I'm not crying, you're crying
This does not have to be juice I don‚Äôt think. Six months is a long time
‚ÄúScreaming outrage‚Äù you say? Project much?
I haven't messed around with it that much, everytime I go in it seems like people are looking for players way better than me.
It was a commercial. Do a lot of conservatives have this problem?
[NAME] out? I thought he‚Äôs been playing pretty well. Wonder why...
I‚Äôd rather reply to you, simply because you sound like an idiot
CONGRATS! So happy for you. May life treat you kindly from now on.
Who is this?
hahaha. ask a person u hate for coffee. as an introvert with [NAME]. this cant go wrong
Sadly too easy to gank. Bronze brawl 4-man notices you are split pushing, you are dead.
I love the outfit that [NAME] is wearing
Justice was served
Let him walk away from the town just far enough that you can lasso him and drag him into the fields. Worked for me
Too bad we couldn't elect a good leader in 2016...instead we got a bum. Oh well, [NAME] is finished. [NAME] 2020 
Increase in robberies on pot shops. I really hope not though.
The average person here could go their whole life without ever seeing a gun. The gangs and such yeah they manage to get guns one way or another
Guys. Our defense is bad outside of like two guys.
Dang.. I‚Äôm none of them. :-(
It's from Game Gyaru
Fake news! He only serves the Bigliest Macs!
People have gotten triggered on this sub the past month if you didn't call [NAME] a [NAME], so I think we can handle it.
This entire discussion is very unnecessary
That's...kinda...why...i...used...the....phrase.
Is her fake chin totally to the right of where it should be here?
Huh.. Well that ruins it :/ At least the cats fine
Oh he'd be far too attractive lol He's southern anyway, would still need to put on an accent 
No, not sarcastically :) 
Huh...I always heard that libido decreasing after a few months is normal even for NTs.
We need griffin we need [NAME] and remmmers and sendejo have always been trash
I was so hopeful...
A shitpost crosspost
[NAME] plays like he's a football player who was asked to play basketball for the day
Some, I assume, are good people.
Blooming Villain with Willpower a close second. Heavily emotionally charged songs used at very dangerous events that suit the theme perfectly.
This story made my day. Ha!
I'd say the bigger potential problem is getting reported for public indecency, that goes on your criminal record.
A 100years? That's far too long dude. Reminder: ww2 was 73 years ago...
I like to think I do but idk my advice could be awful haha.
I like it when a girl's nails are done. Nothing over the top long but I love french tips. Plus they're great for back scratches.
I shout at my kid from the sidelines to stop fucking about with the draw-sting on his shorts...think I've got a shot?
I was afraid things would if we kept seeing each other, which is why I brought this up to her now rather than later. 
You can remove them without killing or etc etc. Just stop reproduction
Wish all my [NAME] mates came with subtitles.
No, that's not possible. If you have proof then it's not misinformation what your spreading but simply information. 
yeah it was a short poll because they thought not many people would vote no. they can play it off like it, but thats the case.
Iunno, I laughed.
Yeah some kid in a BMW ran me off the road. I didnt just crash had some help.
She‚Äôs just not that into you, that‚Äôs what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun. 
Fighting childhood obesity, one babysitter at a pretty pointlessly narrow definition of harassment that includes criticism.
Paraphrasing: I saw [NAME]. No, wait. It was [NAME] and [NAME]. That's the ticket.
Hi !! I totally get you. If you want to be friends I‚Äôm here !! :)
>[NAME] does need to stfu. Like hell, he does. 
No she would just get 18 years in jail (raising a kid).
Don't worry, [NAME] can't even pronounce Kombucha.
That‚Äôs a lazy argument. Racism can be defeated with good education and proper parenting but most people are too lazy to fight for it.
Props to YOU for being so appreciative, sir. :) You don't often see it. Good luck out there!
Thank you brother. I saw you once!
lonzo can be special but teams just aren‚Äôt as patient anymore
It isn't worth your time. Get someone better.
All true, but [NAME] only ‚Äúretired‚Äù to get out of AZ. Now that he‚Äôs back looking for a job...
Breaking news, husband borrows wife's car and should lose their job because of this
Yeah. Plus why he still living with his mom
He looks like [NAME] soooo... accurate.
2. I hate to say it but it‚Äôs the same thing I do and I hate myself for it
There's no way ye should go for a second referendum. Go for BINO and limit the damage.
> It leads to touching and doing inappropriate things with the opposite sex I prefer the same sex, so are these things not inappropriate for me?
> Do you think Amazon reviews are don't mean anything? Yes because they are very easy to game.
i was not prepared for this
Ignoring facts in favor of your own opinion (which is contradicted by those facts) = [NAME] logic
My girlfriend and I watch it all the time and love making love while it‚Äôs playing in the background!
I am the proud owner of a Vernon Gholston jersey. My wife got it for me as a Christmas Gift our first year dating....
You got a license for that sarcasm?
Wtf did I just read? That was painful
This is like the 30th repost i've seen of this
THE PACK RUNS DEEP AND HARD. I WOULD SHARE MY KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE WITH YOU ANY DAY. AROOOOOOOOO
Had a great time playing overwatch, but only *some* of us were getting too drunk for everyone's entertainment >.>
I've been putting off scheduling a dental appointment for a week because of this, I'm just too anxious to pick up the phone and dial. 
I'm also happy you're still here!!
Such a good story. Im now a grown man, crying at work... on reddit.
I tried. [NAME] responded by taking the baby to see her without me, while I was at work. üò§
lmao I love this, I love speaking nonsense to myself as well
A special and unique form of fake news know as the truth.
Good instincts to try to get move out of the road. Hope they are alright.
At least we can all rest easy that it doesn‚Äôt happen in ‚ÄúThe Zookeeper‚Äù
I'm glad you could relate and that you also found some peace and resolution in your relationship. I'm glad we didn't give up!
You can't reason with some people. This person said people call 911 (emergency number) when they see his face.
I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
What do the [NAME] have to do with it
The only crossover I want to see these two on is *Love After Lockup.*
Gross gross gross!
They added colour to Belfast!
They're the ultimate hodlers; the ones who've lost their private keys.
I know you'd think we lost to Arbroath the way folk are going on.
Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
Her mother has been visiting the book sales down at Miskatonic university! You apparently have an excellent reading background, and you've learned well!üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíú
I follow that account in tumblr, it‚Äôs satire. It‚Äôs basically what an incel criclejerk of one person would be.
This sentence has a very different meaning in Australia.
"He's gonna say ""stop eating chips"""
He's getting rest. We're trying to see how he can handle the starter's role.
Wow, never knew about [NAME] and I thought I was well-read!
Oh. My. [NAME]. This entire post hurts my brain. It's beautiful
Yes, and you must be a loonbag. 
It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll
I would have thought so yeah.
I cant‚Äôt stand mint flavored toothpaste. That‚Äôs how much I hate mint.
Happy cake day u/sneakpeekbot!
Yeah it's only been posted 30 times already
I think they could have asked harder ones but this gave me a better feeling of the future.
Troo, troo....worse eban dan eat pizza wif aht a ferk. 
It's nice that we've started giving our backups some time; this gives them trade value when they demonstrate that they can play ball.
I for one am with you on this train. I loved [NAME] man but this sub is losing its damn mind lol
It was 3 grams in total, my buddies and I rolled with our own stuff
Really? First I‚Äôve heard of it lol.
This is a 10/10 on concept alone. I can't wait to see if it's any good.
I‚Äôm making pretty decent money doing Gun Rush. I love it. Discovered I like 1-life modes for this game.
Nope. 7th grade, different state.
I think [NAME] has a pretty unconventional face, also [NAME]
What they are doing is called Parent Annihilation. Courts take that very seriously.
Yeah, he's trash. 
Poor guy :(
[NAME] what a stupid job
Thanks I was worried that I might die alone
I like that energy
I've gotten injured before in RTTS from being hit (Bruised hand). 3 day DL.
It worked with [NAME] and [NAME] I guess. Not so much with [NAME] and [NAME]
I would like to thank this game for being over on time. :)
That's like the US Democratic Party, right? I heard that they support the far-left National Socialist maniac known as [NAME] ([NAME]). ;)
Wrong kind of grass seeds?
Fuck this team. I‚Äôm done, we all should boycott this bullshit
[NAME] is my life!
LOL, that made me chuckle. Have a good one, [NAME]! 
Fuckin Finnish spitz out there bud

That's what I came here for, thanks

Rose coloured glasses get rosier as time goes by :) You'll move on eventually. Treasure the memory but be present in your current and future relationships.
Other than a lame attempt of being insulting, what part of anything you said has anything to do with what I said?

If you have to do side task you consider boring in order to power up and take on the main quest I'd consider that grinding.

Just a suggestion.
It's a strange decision that they scheduled this to conflict with the NFL playoffs in the United States.
Look at a calendar. Look at the 14th. Look at the week that contains the 14th. That week, any of the days on that week.

[NAME] and Resident Evil Biohazard, great afternoon.
I'm sorry for your loss. From the picture it looks like he had a great life if that helps
It was the only thing that changed. The weight gain, terrible acne, and moods... it was all nasty.
Iirc it‚Äôs definitely darker than [NAME], but here it‚Äôs almost the same color.
Nah man. This website smells like toast and makes my left arm hurt.
whhat rene with that hair an...he is the mayor???
The lake is steaming! The water is way warmer than the air
Thank you for your concern fellow conservative
I am truly sorry, I did not realise you thought immigration had no bearing on brexit. I shall not overestimate your intellectual abilities in future, i promise.
My heart broke for him when his wife suddenly passed away. I worried about him with his issues with depression but he seems to be doing okay.
Must not hit opponents on the first frame then. My mistake
In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
[NAME] don‚Äôt make up only 2% of the population though. Edit: I mis-read. I‚Äôm sorry. Please ignore this comment.
Wow! You are close to me in age. I would never do that.
THE ONLY RUMOR I'VE EVER HEARD IS WHETHER OR NOT THE SEARCH FUNCTION EXISTS. SPOILER ALERT: IT DOES.
There should be a vigilante whose superpower is not having to stumble over to somebody after being injured.
Idk why ur being downvoted, I thought that's funny
Are you hungry?
Just out of curiosity... What was the opinion?
that was a horrible call
They can stay but not become citizens.
Baby rape. Can‚Äôt make a funny joke about it.
You are BOTH awful people.
Alright guys I got next on the repost
I like how it's also a subtle girls>guys
Start doing things you want to do? Doesnt need to be the same things as your peers but just the things you like.
Mushroom is the most objective recounter we have, he makes pretty clear [NAME] preferred fucking around in flea bottom over any sort of responsibility.
Damnit tobias.
LOL SO RANDOM
I am with you. Despite leaving stuff at his place, i am slow but surely done.
You know, 4 months of use is basically nothing though. In that case the bad part of the deal is Nvidia's decision to start supporting freesyinc 
You're coming so close to a realisation. So very, very close.
aw too bad im 6.5k, you arent extremely good. 
1. How was the video fabricated? 2. Even if it was, how would this invalidate my statement?
Dang something actually useful rather than a skin we won't use cuz we already have Belzebub
Finally figured out who these two remind me of
Right now, it feels like a good thing but not a great thing. I don't love it... But I don't hate it. 
Wow great video. I love her.
Yeah cheers. Hoping it's gonna be better. Happy early new year to you too.
Can't decide if that's because we're playing gritty basketball late or getting kinda lucky and an inevitable regression to the mean
Don't wo

Lets not meet with a panther. I seriously love this subreddit.
Forehead for days.
Hey now. Kirkcaldy is a lovely place to see in my rear view mirror.
OK. You‚Äôre not distinguishing yourself from an anti-theist. >[RELIGION] [NAME] I said ‚Äòa god‚Äô.
I would pay good coin to read that love story.
Sad if step kids are nice children I am sorry they are in this dynamic
I have my kids signal ba√±o, the letter T in ASL so they don't disturb the class while asking. 
I love [NAME]
That‚Äôs so cool! I can‚Äôt wait to see when it‚Äôs finished!
This really shows how young and ignorant most of them are.
Let me know how that spicy coco turns out please!!!
I believe it was a severe dislocation as opposed to a fracture. Regardless....poor guy....
Word salad. You want America to do Afghanistan's job for them. It's not happening, those days are over.
It appears [NAME] has come back as a cat.
Thank you. For some reason I thought it had been released in all markets.
Nothing ocular about that smackdown. Raunchy just peaked all over [deleted].
It goes that far back? That was probably hands down the best fight ever. I loved stone cold as a kid
None of which should provoke unprofessional behavior.
Thanks, that's exactly what I needed to hear üíú
Yeah I figured it may be something like that. I was waiting it out too.
What do you mean?
I miss him so much during the NCAA tournament.
And it‚Äôs being posted by a person who apparently has an MD, PhD, and MBA. One would hope they knew better
[NAME]!
They stole my joke, damn them!
Yes! And the one who embarrasses you by dancing and singing in the car while she's driving you and your friends home.
Congratulations on your appointment to such a prominent position! I was a huge fan of Utah when I went, the canyons are sick. GO KNIGHTS GO 
I guess as [NAME] grew up from ed edd n eddy, he uses plank as a weapon.
Ehhh I don‚Äôt know, I still find it kind of cringey with the ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù talk and all that stuff.
Aladdin is my jam as well! :D
She‚Äôs out here lookin like Snuffleupagus from the muppets with those big eyes sheesh
Oh jeez. Just look at her eyes compared to the other girls.

Utah grubs This is a great place for restaurant recommendations.
I stopped watching [NAME] the moment vie when they made the sub surface and I realised they were rewriting history. It's insulting.
Wow they got them [NAME]? Those US agents are some lucky guys
Wow got em you know [NAME] made the same mistake ?

The train conductor didn't kill anyone. There's nothing that person can to but watch. So it's a lot easier to believe.
Tell me a couple
he saw it
We have freeish speech. If you can be prosecuted for something you say then you can't in any way that we have free speech.
OMG. How have a I never heard this before? Absolutely dying. You can tell [NAME] just lost it off mic. ü§£
You have an amazing instinct to protect him. It‚Äôs beautiful
What an ugly shade [NAME] used to dye his hair. Well, I guess it matches the infamous shirt.
I wouldn't count out Scotland in the quarters. They're playing well and have given the US headaches in the past.
When you dint know Anarchism at all so you think you can be anarchist and capitalist at the same time !
It's amazing the advantage that you have when you advocate for the ruling oligarchs.
Thank you guys so much! IM FINALLY IN THE KNOW!
Given the horses ass you lot made of the last one, I think it‚Äôs best to put this idea on the back burner.
Wow calm down
T-shirt and basketball shorts
I wish. I got to revisit all the cringy things I liked in middle school. There were almost 1000 pictures and literally 700 of them were memes
Would this not be the bog-standard practice of allowing close family members to make decisions about resuscitation?
Lol always a creepy mike
Same but I‚Äôm not really believing the OP isn‚Äôt a troll.
Oh haha I didn't see that!
Call ambulance or police for a wellness check but make HER pay the ambulance fees/ callout fees, not OP. it should teach her real fast.
Those fries look delicious!!!
That is some serious dedication... He must love his job
"Trolling video, old skul ""slav"" humor... It's a joke :)"
I don't think this is bad enough for the police chief to be embarrassed. (He should be, but he won't be)
I just started watching Brooklyn 99 this week and was looking for this reference. Thank you.
Exactly, you have no clue whatsoever what you're talking about. I've never had an argument with a brainlet quite like this one, so kudos.
It might not feel like it right now, but you‚Äôll give yourself more self-respect to find someone else. And a better life.
I love how dramatic it is. It's perfectly self aware
that was the part that got to me first. ouchie.
I really like [NAME]. He has such a great personality and has great chemistry with the team.
Double barrel Pink eye. Awesome.
I just said, laughing at yourself is a good policy. You alright there?
I‚Äôm not high and that sounds like a good sandwich.
The NPR interview was linked in the article. She used the term skin texture. I knew what she meant.
Saw [NAME] of Big Bang Theory many years ago without makeup and she looked awful, and that was when she was pretty
I used to love watching movie reviews and video essays. But it‚Äôs seems like I can‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore
Yeah good life to you too. Let's hope you and your commie friends dont die of starvation and poverty in your glorious communist future.
Because bullying is a way to enforce social conformity, and discourage people from being different. 
that dude steals so many tweets. i hate him
I met him! He graduated from my high school and came back when I was a freshman to talk to us in PE. Really nice guy.
[NAME] [NAME], you made me think I was going colorblind for a second! How are there more colors in your rainbow than in mine?
People are very keen on this aspect. I‚Äôm not trying to tell anyone this problem is insurmountable. Just that making reasonable assessments is important.
His contract is awesome after July 1
Audio on RiF. You have to manually turn it on
Keep a steady hand, don‚Äôt erase too much, and draw an outline. Don‚Äôt start on details until after.
Do not use logic dude. Not cool.
Damn, sometimes I love people here. 
You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
Best year of my life tbh
I wish this had sound so I could hear the crowd roaring in the background. This is so wholesome. Look how excited he gets.
It was indeed , but holy shit is that cheap and [NAME] :3
At least she didn't cough into it afterwards. Double whammy
Kids are awesome
Big Mac looked good. Mojo looked alright, especially for his first game in a while.
I love it, made me smile. Glad he is helping out animal friends!
[NAME] might've told her when they were talking about [NAME] being on her period.
You‚Äôre fighting an opponent who wants to fight you too. There‚Äôs mutual respect right there. You‚Äôre not fighting [RELIGION].
Do you have any relatives who could support you?
I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!
I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special 
Nope. Don't need rewards at all.

Thanks! Sometimes you need an article in order to shake some sense into someone.
You say only other escape but it's almost guaranteed to save you and makes [NAME] way safer than any other assassin
"Wow those girls in the corner ""twerking"" were the best (worst?) part. "
She said that? Wtf?? That's fucked up. I shouldn't be surprised. Hypocrisy is common with this bunch.
I look forward to it.
No but that's why I stay up way too late.
I'm more surprised the dash cam was functioning properly. Usually around these incidents 3 of them were not recording and one had the lens cap on...
I knew this was stupid when the shittastic music came on.
I have a straight Lebanese friend (girl) and this happens all the time.
This picture is from before 2010. It was funny at the time.
[NAME] was bottom 3 just last split...
This is just a terrible joke
I'd rather have [NAME]. Killing her off was a waste.
Do kids even know who Papa Smurf is these days?
Post this to /r/penmanshipporn I *dare* you. Edit: been done already, I shoulda figured lol
It‚Äôs harder when you have kids with the partner.
That place must be a gold mine of good stories.

Thanks very much. This is helpful
The original post is a repost, I saw that before.
FINISH ON HER!! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll
Thank you a lot! Btw that user name tho üòÜ
That‚Äôs sad, although I‚Äôm aware they historically haven‚Äôt been weaned off of authoritarianism.
*Chocolate thugs don't mess around* That's interesting though. Something to look forward to when you wake up
Ah good, now I don't have to do it.
I just saw it on there... pretty cheap to be such a old item... starting bid on one was a $1

Sadly I had to scroll through the story to read this
Y‚Äôall need one of those world famous mascots. Your top at producing those.
Yeah I do. Not sure what that has to do with you and your incorrect claims about the current generation though.
[NAME] fuck those creeps
Pedes hate him!
Please do!
I've been seeing these since I was a kid! Wish we all had an answer...
We stick out in a crowd. You can run with it or hide from it. I love embracing it!
one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!
Oh you mean a documentary he produced? I watched it and it felt kinda bias imo
That was my mistake. It should only show your First Name and The 1st letter of my last name.
Still annoying.
The furry community loves it.
Oh shit. Is back?! Time to import
Right? It was frustrating (and concerning) that he used such bad reasoning when his job is to curb phishing :/
They must have misheard 'deal' for 'meal'
People on the other side want you dead no matter why you are there.
It *feels* unethical?
Oh. It really is [RELIGION]. I was wondering if that was a bad gag.
I wanna die!
Again nothing, you are the one obsessing over that term, he literally says he puts girls on a pedestal. 
Good thing he realized this was pointless before he resigned from his state senate seat. ^/s
Going from [NAME] to [NAME] on the PP is like going from tenderloin to convenience store hotdogs
According to them, it's perfectly acceptable to have intimacy with a woman and then ghost/block her number. Lol.
Don‚Äôt worry about it I meant what I said thank you really
Also a possibility.
This would have been a perfect test of those Katyushua rocket water dispensers.
You got a reply you walnut, as the guy said, plenty people collaborated this info.
You should educate yourself on HPV. You don't contract it from being careless.
If your walls are not connected sprinkle your lawn in between regularly with diatomaceous earth. It will kill them before they can get to you.
Thank you for sharing your beautiful and continuing story. It's comforting to see growth and deep love in relationships. I wish you both the best!
Keep pushing. You‚Äôll come out of this stronger I promise
[NAME] is a monster, my favorite of the Pythons. Such a perfect smug face.
I just discovered her channel recently too! She's hilarious and I love watching all the diet tryouts.
I skipped school, went directly to be an apprentice. No regrets.
I was talking about you when I said if Idk if your talking about yourself
was it a serious injury? like bleeding on the brain? If so then it could be legit.
haha thats an option
Oh I remember that final , I just dont want to involve my team in the conversation because we share a rivalry
"It seems there is strong agreement on all sides that ""Nothing changed"" now. Is that progress? /s"
Do it successfully and coal country will still say it‚Äôs a stupid idea.
I'm sure you're alright, [NAME]. xD
I actually do have a really good one who specializes in emp law. He serves multiple areas. Will pM
Yeah, live it up so you get a free trip to the zoo.
He sounds amazing. Congratulations for finding that one!
"They could have checkmated the ""journalists"" and avoided this situation by saying they decided to switch to only pay for quality journalistic work."
You really are this stupid aren‚Äôt you? Whatever buddy I don‚Äôt argue spastics.
Thought I was...it boomeranged on me and I am suffering immeasurably right now. Thanks and I hope your day was good.
[NAME] understand a hudna like this alludes to quranic truces made by [NAME], which he violated on extremely flimsy pretenses once the strategic situation shifted in his favor. 
Satire satire satire satire Please O lod almight plez be satire
I'm really sorry for your loss friend. I hope everything is okay on your end too.
My grandpa does drive this way.
Never said I didn‚Äôt have a hobby. Looking for suggestions and a third person perspective thanks
I suppose it is quite frustrating to have someone telling you the sky isn't blue
Depends, but it seems that more states restrict teen drivers from packing their cars with friends than not.
Like [NAME] says you are overcoming an addiction and much like any other addiction in the wild you are suffering from withdrawl symptoms in a sense.
If I could get to GC in 30 min instead of 57, well my life would truly change.
Meanwhile my cat still hasn't voluntarily touched my 1.5 year old son
Time to fill our roster with Schiano Men!
because the cops dont have the manpower to chase after every schmuck who orders small amounts...

You go back to school... Except this time you don't qualify for ANY financial aid, because you already have a degree

The numbers against EEA will go up once people realise it amounts to fuck all but still costs a fortune.
Yep. And if the reaction to the CovCath psyop is any indication there will be riots when her retirement or death is announced.
True, we take pink and black pills daily, even some stacies are conscious of world around them being a grim place.

Everyone is born an atheist. Some gets afflicted with religion usually via their parents.
We needed some way to torture a guy so a religion can be created.
I wish [NAME] was fit enough to be fourth choice.
What in the fuck was [NAME] doing there
And proud!
In the first game, definitely, but they're more even in 2/3. 
You are a god among nurses.
But... but... I know where everything‚Äôs at...

I get wound up over completely imagined conversations too üòÖ I'm trying to meditate and learn to stop myself from going down the rabbit hole.
Then I'll be accused of being a racist.
And always say I love you. My SO is an officer and we ALWAYS say I love you before we leave each other.
You're nicer than me. I would have let them get towed.
"Guess this ""grown man"" had to run back to his safe space because words hurt his feelings."
She wantsyou to rugsweep. She's patronizing you.
Can you explain how she could block all three spots? I don‚Äôt think we understand.
At that point [NAME] was no longer a virgin! No seriously, ask [NAME]! 
Lived in Thailand for a year in the nineties and formed the same opinion. I stopped talking to or helping tourists because they sickened me.

Seafood is nasty af. I refuse to prepare seafood in my kitchen.
Sucks dude. For social creatures we're pretty inept at socialising and helping each other.

I always get concerned when I see Nono standing at the stove or being instructed to pick Milania up from demon spawn practice.
Gay boy here. [NAME] is overrated imo
that's the spirt! *come to the dark side my child, embrace your hate*

Remember when people thought [NAME] could handle this job?
Rawr! (That means I love you in dinosaur!)
I think theres a line between edgy and racist that this meme clearly crosses. [NAME] is still funny, this is just racist.
You weren‚Äôt supposed to know. You‚Äôre not psychic. He‚Äôs being unreasonable
Saw the police and they use an invisible boatcar to get this one is my first heartbreak.
Sounds like you got really lucky bro :). Did you ever see the guy again? If so, did he ever bully you again? 
Lucky for me the yellow ones are my favourite
I hate to say it, but it's never once failed me, I've never been asked to show it.
I‚Äôm more sorry that there are actual [NAME] fans...
I caught that little tidbit too. Very unbiased. Very factual.
would give gold if I had it haha
Our Republic's integrity is under threat by a president who has failed to defend himself and the U.S. from foreign powers.
Seeing something as beautiful as this just made my day today! Thanks for sharing :)
I like it, more please.

Apparently Faux news held off on reporting the story at first, presumably until they could get approval on how they should spin it.
I hope the Rams take it all cause of that. Would love to see [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] win the super bowl again!

no matter what he says, this man is not a [NAME].
This post is so true Clothes these days are so bland
That what my friend says who still wears garments.
unless of course that's a mere sample
Man, I'm 13 and still took my time because the entire volume enclosed. And the heart is from rick and morty copy pasta.
It looks like it's outdoors in the snow, so you'd be wearing gloves anyway.
"Are you throwing such a hissy fit that you couldn't read the ""anywhere else other than the internet"" part?"
[NAME] in Richardson gets my love.
Cus the left doesn't give a shit about people who fought for the USA!
She has some really good dance moves honestly!
I can't believe you would call me that and act like nothing happened. Honestly, what's wrong with you
lmao yes, my reasoned, supported response to your unfounded criticism is most certainly an example of one of the points the hack artist tried to assert
Relive the magic. <3 [NAME] & [NAME]
Seriously? In Dutch right? Because... he's so awkward on his YouTubes in English.
The NBA fan was just one year younger last year and probably had the same viewing habits, thus not impacting the results of the year over year comparison.

How can someone reply without contributing anything meaningful to the conversation.
I‚Äôm sorry men, I have failed you. My rigidity was no match for the flaccid effort our boys showed tonight
So you‚Äôre telling me you think [NAME] is better than [NAME] whatever you say man
Or both!
Wonder what the sub‚Äôs average age is.
This reminded me a little bit of a story [NAME] tells about a [NAME] vs pack of Coyotes Skip to 48 seconds.
That pedo ring that developed under [NAME] tenure makes him the worst owner of a sports team ever, bar none.
No problem here, as long as neither one of you are the asshole.
I appreciate it, thank you. I will discuss consequences with my husband. It will probably be me taking my daughter elsewhere until [NAME] leaves.
How do you know they are [NAME]? Where they caught? Maybe a cat? It's just some crazy person?
I'll give you that. Society is generally in a decline. I don't date men so I can't speak to that.
I'm sorry but [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are my favs this year (and I hated [NAME] in her Season).

I hope you get the help you need. Truly.
he's clearly not equipped to argue, i can't decide if he's a dumbass teenager or a dumbass boomer. 
why is this being downvoted?
Are there a lot of people that defend [NAME]? I dunno I see it here and there but those people are considered idiots by most sane people.
This is hilarious! Please share if she tells us what she thinks the difference is.
Dad's Army! Lol!

3:08am and my laughter has now turned into wheezing sobs
So glad I moved here.
This cut so terribly deep and touched places I had hidden away. I'm at a loss for words.
Her little baby frown is adorable
I feel so sorry for [NAME]..

Unfortunately you‚Äôre absolutely right, no doubt about that 
Thanks man! This was great. :-)
So many insecure balding guys itt.

Threatening to drive your sisters into the ocean is illegal. It's called making a terroristic threat or menacing and can cause her to lose access to your sisters
I think they honestly don't realize they're self-contradictory. It's not your ordinary, everyday doublethink...
[NAME] is retiring but I still agree with your point
Cat is just practicing his Super Mario World skills
[NAME] damn what a comeback. I love this teams fight.

Very good post brother you hit the nail on the head. It is unfortunate that people downvote this post to the bottom when you explain so well.

I was absolutely gobsmacked when I found out an ICU/CCU nurse can be paid the same as a short stay obs nurse in my hospital.
Looks kinda lame
This sounds hard, but not too bad! I'll try some of this. Thanks!
this guy rebuttals.
I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt try this cleanup method when I had serious depression
Tbh I think it‚Äôs hilarious and love it.
Yes, some doctors look down on military docs. However, I've never seen military nurses looked down upon. If anything, it gives them a leg up.
Didn‚Äôt the chinook end? How are her legs not freezing off?!
That'll cost ya.
Cat call girls on thebstreet, but get pissed when its done to his sister.
Delete this post before you wake the wolves. It is okay for [NAME] to be influenced by the [NAME] and [NAME], saying the reverse is just stupidity.
Of course. It would mean you owe them an unspecified favor in the future. That would be horrible.
I‚Äôd lick the juice off Master‚Äôs face any day, n-no matter how sour...

If it were [NAME] being negative about Korea, would you be equally happy to see it banished?
Somebody has got to be a parent lol
Ohhhhh yeah.
I wasn't trying to counter your whole argument by objecting to a particular bit I found particularly silly
That's the best catch I've ever seen
What a fuckin n
[NAME] blows. Be happy she‚Äôs gone
The deer had been hit by a car and it was only fitting not to let the skin go to waste
Okay, a little confusion. Why are those ‚Äúd‚Äùs not cancelling out? Edit :skittle-a little
Good [NAME] she needs to stop
Given [NAME] was in charge of the transition I don't see how he kept his hands clean. I think if [NAME] goes down so does he.
lol Whatever that proves, sure.
I‚Äôm sure the hornet will be happy if their curse is over!
Why's it called going into 86'ed mode though? I've never heard that before, it's interesting

If you read the comments above I mention my sources.
Yes but they deliberately ignore what the Bible says and give their pagan traditions more authority than they do to [NAME] Word the Bible.
Check her hormones. If they are normal then you need to get out ASAP and consider her position a blessing.

Your previous typo makes your position on the matter slightly ambiguous
And just the ‚Äústop looking at me‚Äù was so old school. It was nice!
More like [NAME]. 
No. She was out of crack and jonesing. That‚Äôs what that‚Äôs about.
This feels *so* cringeworthily thirsty after [NAME] ridiculous meet & greets recently.
My withdrawal was marked as complete. Likely doesn't matter now though with the servers being completely offline.
That's a lot to keep in your head to maintain a lifestyle.
How is anyone so stupid to not vaccinate their child?
I always say thank [NAME] we can‚Äôt comprehend it!!

Sad to see this as a one-off. [NAME] seemed to be really enjoy the game and itself. Will give the game a try.
"Or more aptly ""OHHHHH FUUUUUuuuck"" As you see me run away."

That‚Äôs what I was thinking too but I didn‚Äôt want to just assume lol.
What the fuck is wrong with this?!?!?!??? FUCKKKKKKKK!!!!!
Cue uncontrollable giggles.
Actually that specific detail is one of the few you can actually use as Lucio. Because it has a horizontal aspect you can wall ride it.
Glad your nights going well guys
Actually nothing. The only thing is it's hard to brush while sitting down. I have to stand up.
Four onions grew into one. I have a pic from when I halved it. I'll post it when I'm not working

The fact that this hasn‚Äôt happened to [NAME] yet in this day and age is simply incredible.
To me the toenails is the grossest part! ü§Æ
[NAME], you're annoying. Did [NAME] steal your girl or what? Everytime someone mentions [NAME] on this subreddit, you appear to trash talk him.
Considering their plans, they won't have to spend too much time in order to consider it the rest of their life..
Well I guess Blazers lose cause they're down? :(
[NAME] yer fucked.
I am inexplicably excited by [NAME]. I get so excited by how he curls passes

Being ugly and confident does not mean you'll do well in dating. You'll just try more.
"No or low contact. I don't have time for ""family"" that doesn't have basic courtesy for me. "
Pretty fucking brutal when your starting front court is 0-10 from the field. Whatever. I figured we would split this back to back anyway. Good game for our big 3.
Or woman who would look beautiful without her glasses and ponytail.
Yeah, I‚Äôm at the dh store. so it‚Äôs far but not that far. People really are horrible.

Thimerosal isn't even in vaccines anymore, due to the controversy.

No, a plot hole means that your story lacks logical consistency

[NAME] knocking [NAME] out. Somehow, I didn't expect the brainwashed soldier to betray the kids.
Dont try to force her out of it. She will (probably) turn on you before she turns on him.

Cool! Thanks for responding! ;)
To be fair that would be a hella stiff drink.
I see. Thanks again.
Poor fish :(
Me too I hope all goes well for both of us

I ahead and report this jerk offs!!!!
I just don't like OP for not explaining it before using the abbreviation. So even though the TIFU was great I downvoted it.
How? They don't have SoundCloud or anything and it's usually played before you're killed.
Oh god [NAME], stick to your day job whatever that is.
Did he actually have anything planned or...
Please provide a source, as far as I know our DND said they found nothing of the 
Hysterical!!!!
Just making a joke from The Office. My bad haha
> I didn't catch the set before it got taken down Have a listen:
Your aunt has some damn nerve, though!
The only people eating it are impotent or ignorant foriegners.
Internalized misogyny is very real, too.
Omg yes lol it‚Äôs the story of my life
ah. I see :) Still brave of you.
What‚Äôs a matter? I thought you liked faces.
Because it shows that every other woman on earth has rejected him.
The third picture is creepy.
Good. Now all that is required is that people don‚Äôt show up.
Happy cake day!
[NAME] and and [NAME] still look the same ahhh
Well, could be worse. It could be India.
"I do recall him saying at some point that he was ""unsure"" whether he would vote for [NAME] or not (or something along those lines)."
Seems like cutting out the middleman. They already know they are fat so no need to go to the doctor
Not incel related
i remember my grandparents seemed to hate each other. my grandpa had a hearing aid and when grandma starting nagging he'd reach up and turn it off.
Remindme! 5 months
I love Arkansas. /s.
So in 1 year she goes from nothing to a [NAME] master capable of training others?
Why do you keep going back the them? Why should care about hillbillies?
I agree. She seemed to truly love [NAME] . [NAME] loves the life [NAME] provides fir him. It‚Äôs a sad situation.
What have you censored?
or, you're just being a good mom. Don't take his comments personally.
Why am I excited for the new season
I like Simmonds, but I feel like he will command to highball price to pay for someone who will sit on the 3rd line.
Of course. I'm glad you were able to revisit in a healthy manner.
That‚Äôs so scummy, I‚Äôm hoping the pepperoni just slid down? 
Also, lay a piece of tp down BEFORE you drop your first deuce. Then nothing left behind!
I do this but that's because I miss a lot on first watch and my Bf doesn't.
Sadly I see it being a call to party like there is no tomorrow for the vast majority.
Ok, fair enough... This one works
What a masterful bit of propaganda. Get the left to want war and criticize peace.
HELL YES !! [NAME] where you at
Wow look at this deep pockets eating a lentil a day, I have to slice mine to last me a month!!!
You have no right to be there waiting to be nudged.
Time to do my thing.
Here did you know that [NAME] slept with 35,000 women. Outrageous.
You really going to claim our foreign policy is equivalent to that of Iran and Russia?
Yea he‚Äôs a good shooter love playing as him in MyGm
here‚Äôs to the highlights when i was convinced that this was much more than just some some-night shit I know you don‚Äôt need me right now ***cries in Blonde***
When bear attacks kick him I'm the ball!
Ok google it then. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Another strange signing. [NAME] seems great at spotting backup players. 20 odd signings and probably 4 have been decent?
This spring is so loaded, it's almost too much at once!
The capitalist countries have welfare for those that can cope. The other countries dont.
The extra B is for bargain.
Sorry dumbass, the provision is for paid **training days** But nice try
You need help.
Update: I still like football
There's always something endearing about a reply trying to keep the enthusiasm going. You enjoy that new toy as much as you can.
We're are going on a trip, in our favorite rocket ship
Good bot!
Yep. ~~(Also, I'm not interested in getting arrested so sorry.)~~
I can't tell if you're serious.
Oh sure. I bet [NAME] is sick. Sick of Skyward Sword.
What a load of old shite.
I know it‚Äôs crazy, but I think it would work and they would probably understand 
Lol just leave it bruh it adds character
[NAME] even eluded to the fact that his mom was a bit put off by her age after asking it.
I agreed with your comment until you told people they shouldn‚Äôt be parents for not knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.
I'm cracking up at my desk now, thanks
I suspect that it's harder to combat sexism in academia because racialized theories have fallen out of favor but sexist ones are still all the rage.
I do this. Every. Single. Time.
I hope you can be saved one day. Bless you.
Holy shit that was fucking bad...
I hate when that happens.
He hits [NAME] dead on, [NAME] is the one who dodged the one handed spirit bomb
Just from observing and polling people around me, they don't care.
But all this does is hurt the average person not the right way to raise money.
30 you illiterate fuck
It's a miracle
They were just gonna do a review parody of their favorite movie. What‚Äôs hard to understand?
She went on a PR tour in Syria and met with him. I think it‚Äôs fair to say she‚Äôs pro-Assad.
And it's posts like this why HotS is in the position it is. Blind to any form of criticism.
Unless you have an established career and are a high earner then sorry but you _are_ the shared housing type.
I‚Äôve not had it happen on mobile but that is because I use apollo. This happens on desktop
Congratulations! We're all rooting for you! üíïüìö
Dumb question: what's a gilding train?
I like my coons too
Forgot about that. In browsing it looks like he is eyeballing other OC jobs.
"Join Wattpad! There are many great books and it's free :) If you want ""real"" books, [NAME] is definitely worth reading. "
A K9 unit was killed in Duluth, MN yesterday. The handler was shot as well, but survived. It was a domestic.
They too wish they could be comfortable, but they have this idea that they can't.
I am still missing money from a August 2018 withdrawal with no update and no success. Quadriga - give me back my money!
I meant after he first suspected the incest and told [NAME]. He went to Dragonstone as he was afraid he would be killed.
I would watch just to hear [NAME] talk about how great he is at pinball.
I like your style B)
Your mental health matters the most. You can't help him more than you do, but you can help yourself. 
But you'll downvote and complain but not provide any reasoning for your complaints? You sound like a child. Grow up.
Right but even without the FPTA surely we could have found ourselves in the same situation from a legal perspective?
This times a thousand. They set us against each other so we don't realize who the real enemy is.
I think you're probably a shite irl.
He is looking for the one that is leaking information, he doesn't want to throw anyone under the bus on purpose
Ironic, since cleaning your room is what [NAME] is always on about.
I just shit my pants. Then walk away. Embarrassing enough he won't press or follow you.
That‚Äôs because she went on to miss the lay up
I just said okay then moved on Edit: he's really naive about all this because he's like 13 But validating af
wow bailed tf out
Yes, you do live in a clown world, laugh it up, degenerate.
You nailed the crazy eyes. She scary.
Thank you good sir. Yes I can see what I was doing wrong. I will start to apply for jobs starting tomorrow and work my way up.
I would if possible but we are a flexible bunch.
Hahaahahaaha I‚Äôve almost completed the online story but i only have 3 gold bars so far lmao
I love you. I had no idea before now, but I love you.
The nerve!
Very nice!! I love your art! What journal is this? I love the texture on the pages.
You probably can. They're shit at hurling.
We knows mumps immunity wanes; is it possible for measles immunity to do the same thing? I'm kinda scared to try Googling it too.
Really that's not very sad at all
He really would be. It's not even an abortion anymore!;It's just post-birth killing!
but this girl said no make out lmao she just want a cuddle buddy till marriage XD
Shut up about the sun! SHUT UP ABOUT THE SUN!!!
I kinda wish people memed him a lot more because he has so much comedy potential. I hope my words inspire to meme him more
Shut tf up. [NAME].
That number seems a bit low to me
Always have a Stockholm syndrome induced craving for HSE standard jelly and ice cream anytime I think of hospitals here
Name and shame
I'm not very good at pressing the devils doorbell, but apparently I'm decent at licking it.
Agree!!
These questions tell you'll be a fantastic dad! Don't sweat it too much and make sure you enjoy it. They grow up quick :)
I agree. His parents were very supportive then. When they did a cast change, they decided to make his parents jerks! 
You clearly know exactly what your talking about with your medical terminology...damn your intelligent. üñï
It's the right sub but why did we even set-up so defensively in the first place? Utterly bizarre.
Comedycemetery? More like repostcemetery
Oh my god Del Monico. Horrific. Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me gag.
I have severe sugma and you're tricking me with your stupid word games. Shame on you.
No no no no no no no Op you‚Äôre a brave one.
Walk among us a classic!
Love this show :)
Please don't ruin our self-deprecating-humor cope.
"I love when that happens. I call it ""butt cuddles"" and we do it all the time lol!"
That's a good point, I didn't think of that. It's too late now, of course, but I'll remember for the future.
There's so much information to process here
I'm sorry OP, every single thing on that list is incredibly wrong. I hope you're doing well now. 
sweet home alabama
Watching this hurts my head
Gawd but [NAME] is a bitch.
It usually comes out after people catch me dissociating.
> I'm sure there are plenty of us who have been through it to. Seconded.
Nope, although I have some Serbian-American friends there who danced for the Tamburitzans :)
That was amazing!
See this is why they should merge r/forhonor and r/forhonormemes cause clearly it makes no difference what subreddit it‚Äôs on
Almost forgot to check if it‚Äôs dead. Edit : NOPE!
I don't do the things you mentioned above, I just draw shit ^all ^^sfw ^^^ofc But hey, thanks for that ;-)
unbridled bigotry that started as a meme but ended... well, it hasn't yet but its not looking good
In the least condescending way possible I think you have some gross misconceptions and I'd like to clear them up.
I know North America is a big place but I wonder what it will take to see similar crowds in cities over here.
I actually do that
what are people's opinions of chronic reddit usage in a relationship?
What? No way do I want to see a Boston coach behind our bench!
I‚Äôd go at [NAME] every possession. He is so tired out there
I came I saw He broke His jaw
Helpful tip: it's difficult to sleep when you're in extreme pain. So find a hammer or something
How done is she? (Check all that apply) [ ] Done. [ ] So Done. [ ] She can‚Äôt even.
Ding Ding Ding, exactly where I called BS
Sometimes for a laugh, I will come to r/Canada to read comments of the ignorant.
>Pretty much as soon as he said he was going to work towards income equality he was killed. It wasnt for his civil rights work.
It‚Äôs lunacy to think that [NAME] is an actual Russian agent, since there‚Äôs literally no evidence of this.
Have you watched the last couple of games? He has run the offense as much as [NAME] has.
Gotta know a season ticket holder willing to part with one. Did a quick search and found a few for sale.
All the best to you truly. I hope you can find balance in yourself which is what we all secretly need
You have no legs to stand on to accuse me of such.
You've never smelled a woman on her period? It's awful.
Well I wish we could all get along too.
Yeah, when I saw she was in LA, I really hope that. Oh please, be true.
I'm with you. I'd love for my nex to read what I post. It probably wouldn't matter because she has zero self-awareness.
Thanks! Life often ends up being the most beautiful when you least expect it :)
wow, there's no way [NAME] should 'er scored that
Dude nice catch lol
So just for the record, I‚Äôm with you on the football end: Love the Broncs, hate the Pats. üèà
Honestly could be faster to just install ublock real quick.
Yeah Q was bad card I was just bloating the pot. I definitely feel this is one of the worst hands I‚Äôve played.
Keeps people from talking to me as much, so in fact I DO need them.
Whoa am I reading this right? The lowest cost is $3.66 now? and not $2.66?
"Do people really use the phrase ""my kid is poorly"" to mean sick? The grammar in this post is really bothering me."
Have to admit I thought this story would end with her demanding food or something.
Sorry I kind of took it like you were flexing on my or my opponents skill or something lmao
Shes stunning haha
Big if true
This song was my jam in 2018. [NAME] bless you.
Oh yeah, from the vulcan council
hi [NAME], toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes.
I saw in another thread that the kid had previously pranked the barber, and this was his way of getting back at him. 
Are you saying only corrupt companies make a profit? That doesn't sound right to me.
You should be required to be 25+ if you want the government to acknowledge your marriage. So stupid.
Do you have to inject insulin into your veins? I'm assuming yes but I've never seen anyone do it.
Stop crying already
Loved this book
I'm sure that's a really important issue to you that consumes your daily life...
Doesn't matter what we do. The announcers will trash the Wolves and praise the Lakers. I miss [NAME] and [NAME].
"Ask if they can send your mother a thank you note so she knows that you did not accept her ""gift."""
I did this a couple years back. Daily binged on Simpsons. So Good.
is [NAME] playing?
This is embarrassing, but while purging I wear a pad or don‚Äôt wear pants at all. Eating disorders are so beautiful /s
It's so really sad how praising the Creator ([NAME]) has become something associated with terrorism... Astaghfirullah.
Shawty whats wrong with you. I want those people dead
K. If you can't see that staffing and turnover are a contributing factor to quality of care then idk what to tell you. Cheers.
Following ya for updates. I hope they catch them soon!
[NAME] was one of the only good things in that season
Keep turning a blind eye to the truth. It unnatural.
THIS MADE ME CRY
Being bullied is what taught me I wasn't wanted anywhere.
I thought this was an obvious gimme in the first place.
I‚Äôm sorry. He‚Äôs in a better place. I hope you can keep the good memories
Well, its been hours and I was correct. The OPs comment was totally 100% incorrect. Have a great day, thanks for playing. LMAO!
He's funny for sure... lol!
I love how debt can now fully destroy hum after this move
Wiggins midrange magic!
Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household.....
OMG! I need to make these. This looks so good!
Ha keep him on his toes
The fact that she told you your sex life is over is insane to me.
I have literally been waiting for a ‚Äú [NAME]‚Äù I‚Äôm from Ontario Canada and love Texas.
I think the book portrayal is more ambiguous than you say. I like that the show leans into one interpretation of her character instead of keeping it vague.
I‚Äôm really glad [NAME] wasn‚Äôt [NAME]
And then expanded on! It's so good. Haha I still remember hours and hours spent on Friends of Mineral Town though...
>Pri*toiletries*
I love [NAME] goggles.
The second i had a coven free weekend I went into ranked. I already knew how the roles had worked because I watched skimms videos
Not to be critical, but ‚Äúrethuglican‚Äù is an awful one 
> unwanted touching, intentional flashing, obscene gestures, sex-related insults, etc. I wouldn't think those would happen less in a single sex thing.
THANKS ^(that was close...)
To make money from money is disgusting and is screwing up the economy.
Feel free to leave.
Thank you for this encouragement. It's been a very long time since I've made any progress
I'll share some soon. Just as a heads up: There seems to be quite a bit of trickery going on.
10 steps ahead? More like 10 billion steps ahead
Double the size of mine
So everyone‚Äôs cool with the corn rolling on the floor then? alright cool.
Yeah...when can the neckbeard asking this question feel okay if he masturbates?
"I'm pregnant! ""How dare you?!"" I love it."
I like this template, it makes me happy.
Then enjoy your shutdown!
No, I just haven't seen that here, and I wanted you to show me that's all.
Do I make you ornery, baby? Do I?! Ok.. Yeah, I probably do now..
These are icels. Anything that has its own porn category is kinky to them.
thanks i used to sell cashews nuts and they the people called it the nuthose so i used the name
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
What a strange song
Always worth a try. Good luck!
the carl g is older than the M72 tho
Not sure if this means solution or obtrusion.
In the time I've been seeing this he has already lost 3
Has Medicaid stopped? Most people I know who support this want Medicare or Medicaid for all.
Happy New Year
[NAME] damn I need a cigarette now
A beautiful wonder of nature. Dress prices have fascinated humanity for thousands of years and been the subject of poetry and art in cultures across the globe
It's the wisdom of the fool.
I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.
You don't really work for the TSA if they aren't paying you. You are a slave. Go home.
AW YEAH HUGE WIN FOR FEMINISM AND WOMEN AMIRIGHT GUYS /s
Uh huh.
Or how big shoes he has to fill
My favorite Green Goblin mask is on a truck in the [NAME] flop Maximum Overdrive.
Alllllllways. Losing that toonie makes you feel like a rookie every time.
"Exactly, she wasn't ""venting"", she was abusing his fiancee. "
Congratulations! It's an amazing feeling isn't it! üòç
I don't necessarily hate them, but then again, I dislike it when people breed while knowing how harsh life is.
LOL this. I would love to see that.
Oh, I wanna play through at the same time. Have a mini race to the finish vs [NAME]. 
Imagine being scared of a black bear
She‚Äôs a good person who stands up for people not like her, and they can‚Äôt stand that.
Is pleading the 5th even legal? I mean, people should be forced to defend themselves even from erroneous claims.
I see where [NAME] got his training.
this reddit is so good man i feel at home
I saw the first 10 seconds and I feel like I understand
Will do! Thanks!
Good news though. Yesterday the devs were running test server during the morning.
I agree with this
Pretty much same. It‚Äôs always me who has to change. I‚Äôm the one wrong.
One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen
Ah geez what a disaster if she tries this!
"[NAME]: ""I'm a better mother and spend more time with [NAME] than most working women spend with kids."" Talk about delusional."
Just triggered me thanks
I was told that upon waking up from a surgery, my first phrase was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt Terri [NAME] me‚Äù ‚òπÔ∏è
As a Bears fan, I'd have preferred them to not have it and for it to not even exist because none of it ever happened.
It‚Äôs on Snapchat twice every time I load it up
Some people just need reassurance that they are, in fact, dumb. 
Clock the flair but What are the judges on? I live for ms Manila but [NAME] safe again? Gurl..
Thank you for the advice!
Hey [NAME], just wanted to say thanks for coming to Minnesota, that‚Äôs all :) 
Think about how many times OP has jerked it into those sheets
[NAME] and I, we're gonna have a hell of a time!
Weird how he doesn't have to say the word review in order to spend the entire article reviewing
I refuse to believe any of this is real. I'm sure his agent will issue a statement that his Twitter and Instagram are compromised
Once the work has been done to certify the car, it cannot be undone. Easier to go the other way.
some people just want attention..lol
I think you should make the distinction that these are Lus and not just AF
ITT: Giant Douche or Turd Sandwich? Whichever can beat [NAME]...
She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
Yep, they still have the youth sweatshirts as of a couple days ago. Wish they had adult sizes!
She‚Äôs a disgusting snob.. Feel bad for the workers. :(
Lmao imagine thinking rubbing a smelly oil on your face will make you grieve better
Any [NAME] who are into this, hit me up! Love me some trance & techno. Can't wait for Transmission Sydney in March :)
Anyone have that mirror?
old school from back when we won the cup
I would hope the guy is genuine and honest, but in my circumstances, there's not much closure. 
Repost. But still nuce.
Sure. We can back another vote if it's found out that remain was illegally funded by [NAME], constantly lied.
Thank you everyone for the suggestions. I think they're great much easier than my thoughts of trying to donate money instead of the contents.
This is ok as extra content, but it feels really uncomfortable.
Ah, tis the coder life. Be glad you didn't accidentally wipe a database or something, haha.
You are forgetting driving. Somehow the law is full of examples of this double standard.
This sub needs more Poison memes.
He needs a swing change. Too much swing and miss for that level
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but she is more than likely dead and will never get to say goodbye
Too bad =(
Sweet sweet air con. Apparently it‚Äôs going to be a hot one today.
Oh, I‚Äôm so sorry! Good luck, I hope your 3000% more successful than me! Sending love and support!!!!!
can't remember much of what happens. All I do remember is I was miserable. Good performances, but it was a bit dour for my taste.
[NAME] just commented on my comment with links to the pamphlet! ‚ÄòTis real!
There was no Last Airbender movie. [NAME] has invited you to Lake Laogai.
I'll be surprised if *Monty Python's Life of Brian* wasn't one of those.
Done. Good riddance. Thank you for your comment
I got you dude! I use it a ton, Glad I could make it worth it for you!!
thanks, just sold my house to go all in
can't tell if trolling or retarded. i think both
People: Hey! Me: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!
*We're allll in this together~*
Grant us pies, grant us pies.
I see. Thanks again for taking the time. I'm very isolated from the world so It's good to finally talk to someone about those things.
Can't believe he took the time to count that. They both seem a bit obssesed.
Thank you comrade
Coulda had [NAME] at a much cheaper price but apparently we gotta have a hard on for returning players.
Overall I'm 'gifted' but my processing speed is still below average
But he was so *hurt* when [NAME] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin.
If I had that I‚Äôd stop working and travel full time. I do not understand the avarice of the wealthy. It makes no fucking sense.
This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.
Just not the right year to tank. POOR planning by the FO.
The way him and his mom talk to each other is like a little boy and his Mommy!
Don‚Äôt forget to show your work!
Yea I saw that...had me worried for a sec but I had no trouble at Delta
When is the battle point for squad spawning back?
I heard stronger when it came on the radio one day
In whom? There are millions of people walking around today with no problems.
Three words for you. Stand your ground.
Yeah, anyone the team has dibs on and even the team's UFA vets can participate in offseason activities. They have to sign an off-season participation agreement.
"Read the poem ""To this Day"". I just read it. I liked it."
Well.... fuck
ngl his total thievery of the lwymmd lyrics was highkey annoying to me but the song is actually pretty damn good lol
Thanks for the link. She actually likes some of the stuff!
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN NEVER POST ON REDDIT AGAIN! I AM THE ENBODIMENT LF r/iamverybadass
Thought he dislocated his shoulder at first
‚ÄúStill wearing ATM‚Äù this bit has me crying! Thanks for the mental image.
I love how he said he was moving on and then didn't move on. Classic [NAME]!!
can't wait to develop nutrient management plans for crop production!!!
More fake news from CNN. I thought coming off the last fake news blowup they would at least bother to watch the video before writing their ridiculous story.
why is this guy assuming the teen is some kind of southern pro slavery hick
UGH ME TOO! Eager to wake up with mania, any day now.
Omg yes!
Thanks for the heads up, I'll wait until next week to head down. 
Who took the photo?
Might be an unpopular opinion but I actually enjoyed the faster ruck speed. Spewing they didn't stay strong and stick to their guns
Came here to see if i was the only one. The whole edit is one gigantic mess.
Sounds good.
They missed the irony of the original post and ran with it as if it were serious. Got tons of gold and upvotes.
They must love books because they demolished that one pretty quick. A har har
Reality is often disappointing
Holy shit, it's never occurred to me I'll still be anxious at 50. Thanks for this, very informative
I know you will make her proud. always appreciate your parents they won‚Äôt be here forever ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't know, but there's probably a word for it in German.
It doesn‚Äôt help
[NAME], now you have my attention. Do you want your fun fact or no?
This is awesome. Thank you!!!!
Ikr. Who the hell goes to Greggs for *pizza*?
Self serving cowards.
Ecosystem in a puddle, nice
Wayakum, [NAME] make it easy for you inshAllah. Feel free to PM me if you or your brother have any questions. Would love to help out.
He‚Äôs Russian you forgot that.
"That ""Hard work"" usually involved the junkrat pressing Q so I'm not about to shed tears"
Well... this should get interesting.
Whoever is bandersnatching our off-season needs to quit it.
Ooooh wow. üòÜ
But it literally had. Her name on it. Kids are so fucking stupid.
Godspeed and be well, [NAME].
I freakin' love Corgis!! üêïü•∞
"Wow, pulling her by her hair and throwing her on the ground doesn't exactly say ""respect me"" in any way."
u/dances-with-corgis Says they'll never forget their username. Literally forgot their username. Sorry, but: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ, that's some [NAME] level tiny mess up.
Wrong, it's not 365 days a year. Once every four years, it's 366 days a year.
Hahaha ;)
Nothing will, no, but it gives /r/conservative ammo against a sub like this. 
That is by far too strong of a passive
Oh don't worry, their kids were taken away. 
So everyone elses advice is invalid? Elaborate.
this is a thing? oh no
I didn't call you a [NAME]. Your use of Nazi-adjacent statements is extremely sketchy, though.
Could they not have been quarantined when diagnosed at the airport? (Genuine question, I have no idea about this shit)
Haha, that‚Äôs meeee! 
Is that you, [NAME]?
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind. Glad he‚Äôs still in the NHL. Poor [NAME] was playing in the KHL last I heard.
Back in my day the only bars you could find were real onesüë¥
Can't lose if you never stop appealing. Or at least that's what I'm told by your cohorts.
Or if you've hit the menopause. I guess sex amongst old people is an abomination too
Get the lad a prize.
Great, now my balls hurt and I‚Äôm yawning uncontrollably. 
Also known as the song ice cream trucks play. I was wondering why it sounded so familiar!
2 Minute [NAME] is the scariest [NAME]. I fear they have yet again, like the regular season game, scored too soon.
I regret that I have but one downvote to give.
Wow. Thanks for this.
Lol omg yesssss. Probably the best suggestion anyone ever told me üôåüèº
Maybe she'll finish Wardenclyffe Tower and stop Slappy and his monsters!
I‚Äôd love the current battle system blended with the old system of sneak/blending and a modern day story that Ubisoft actually care about.
Just waiting to see which outlets decide to report it first.
People who live in glass houses...... [NAME]. This punk has no right to smack.
Do you smoke? Smell strongly? Have dirty boots?
I'm really happy he and [NAME] are finding success
It was probably either a wrong number, a prank call, or a girl you forgot you met and she was embarrassed. If something more happens update us 
Oh, real cool! Thanks for the references.
Sorry for all the questions I just find ASPD to be a fascinating disorder. I have BPD SO to me not having emotions sounds like a dream.
Then when you dropped them that was it for youth group cred for the night. Lol
>And you contribute to them not interacting with other people... Which I never told anyone not to. Hmmmmm
I watched that one, her butt is real lol
Wonder if the balls are deflated... that worked well against the colts last time.
seems odd, when you guys consume much more pizza, I would say overall than us
I'm always paranoid of people following me when I am driving home. I would have pooed my pants yikes.
It's the great irony of The Resistance¬©. It's hard to be a rebel when most of the powerful institutions of the country are on your side
I love that sometimes I don‚Äôt know what he says but like I vibe wit it instead
Tbh the floor is probably more comfortable than the seats. Doesn't make it safe though.
Micklethwait Craft meats and La BBQ are right up there with Franklin.
Ya well if I have a daughter I hope my husband doesn‚Äôt have these excessively weirdo and aberrant aspirations for her. Smh
Forever alones your army needs you and your lack of attachments

I adore this comment section <3
It's cool to see more organised stoners too haha
The people of NI need to know the joy of football special
Just out of interest, what mm rank are you?
Originated joke by:
do you promise?
Honestly, I respect [NAME] for doing what he felt was best for business. [NAME] can go fuck himself.
I watched a video about fake makeup having rat piss in it. No thank you
Because at best, you‚Äôre a racist and an apologist for at least a wanna-be dictator and his supporters 
Sorry that you lost that stuff. But that's a lot to have in your car in SF
Yes. Those are all the words from the gif. Good job guys.
Because there isn‚Äôt an unlimited supply of beautiful 20-year-olds.
Omg my 3yr old kept rubbing it all over his face the other day too!! üòÜ
I know logically that I haven't gained real weight but overeating both weekend days makes me feel like I have. I drive me crazy sometimes.
Life as a chef= late nights with booze and strippers.. wife doesn‚Äôt approve of it but hell with her somebody‚Äôs got to suck itü§´
I go 2x on all semiauto
Yeah pretty much. People do change, but never ever do they change because someone else demands it from them.
Worst deal on the leafs right now easily
"""look at you... look at you..!"" Oh, I'm bawlin. "
Right on [NAME] having a big year, but [NAME] was super disappointing this year.
Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.
It wouldn‚Äôt be our biggest free agent signing in a second considering he‚Äôs not a free agent.
Women wear makeup to threaten other women. It has nothing to do with men. Same w all their weird mutilations.
[NAME] will find his form again. I‚Äôm keen to see him link up with [NAME]
This only makes me want him more. Proves he is decisive and has self belief. Our team has been devoid of both.
I want to bounce a whole roll of quarters off that ass, holy shit.
You look like a guy that could use help pleasing his wife.
LIGHT THE BEACONS!
Pretty sure we‚Äôre the ones being carried with no thunderlords...smh.
God. Damnit. Ever since HS hockey players have been my fetish... This is almost too much...
We're worse to animals than we were 100 years ago, js.
Apparently I'm ugly because I don't have 20 strangers a day coming up to me to tell me I'm attractive :(
LMFAO wtf that's great
A world where I despise a good number of republicans AND democrats.
Spending your handouts and having some taken back doesn‚Äôt in any way make you a contributor.
I mean, struggle enough, the ropes will become loose. You'll live, go to the police, and get in some kind of protection.
I'm sorry you're going through that, I wish I could help somehow :c.
I think it‚Äôs funny, especially those eyes! Lol
school is not that bad
just a single point
Well, the bill was about 100+ per person. Must be amazing lunch there.

It's nice, but there isn't much there :p 
Exactly lol.
I was expecting it and I jumped. I don‚Äôt even have thlassaphobia lol
Those subs ... wtf
When does it drop again?
I know from personal experience that that can be the end of any good relationship.
"Thank you. Apparently simply stating ""it's from a comic called ""supply side Jesus"" wasn't pedantic enough for that guy."
Dude I love these
Those words you used. I don't want to believe that exists.
3 under 3?! You are a true hero.
You would though wouldn't you, its not as if he was worth keeping around, disposable DA,
[NAME] so much hate.
Bro tip: If you try this but still can't find any 10s, you can still have an extremely mediocre threesome with 2 5s
Her license hasnt been revoked though ;( If purposefully giving people the wrong medecine isnt enough of a reason then idk what.
I can only assume the island is called the Spanish word for purgatory.

Easy just include [NAME] to continue to torment [NAME]
Regardless of their ability to turn the water on or off this solves the problem of not being able to reach the water to wash their hands.
I‚Äôm curious what is their concern and their purpose to be plus-size people influencers regarding the fact that they do not belong to that group?
He knows he's not playing as well as he should be. By that logic [NAME] wants out so he should go too.
Clickin‚Äô it!
What real things pop out of existence because you stopped looking at them?
Because you aren't serious. You're just mad because you got told to stop using slurs one too many times.
We say it the most m8 that means it's our word and we pronounce it correctly
I'm sorry you needed to add this. I thought your humour was pretty obvious, but this is reddit....
Wow they are on the cusp here. Definitely not fellowkids because I would totally believe an actual fellow kid said this
Don‚Äôt be fooled by Garlic Bread. The cringe still exists.

Yeah he's a real one. I would've loved him coaching the Broncos
I will be definitely doing this now. We have a meeting next week, so I will be sure to bring this up. Thanks!
That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
Insensitive tweets don't help, though.
Holy shit I grew up in Sugar Land! Moved to Philly. Didn‚Äôt expect to see it on reddit today. This made my day.
This would be a good thing. I want capitalism to die.
There are quite a number of things we do in modern life that are not sustainable over the short term.
Yep - I was meaning for that to be rhetorical. And thanks, I'm looking out for numero uno!!!
This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
No one wants the wrong person executed for a crime fool
Me too. It‚Äôs my favorite. His cadence in saying it is so perfect lol.
Pistons gonna have to part with something the fans don't wanna give up. Haha
Great! Now down with [NAME]!!
Probably just do the job and try to work out your anxiety rather than taking the path of least resistance which offers no character growth. Best of luck
I love that you know this tidbit!
Couldn‚Äôt get the votes in the senate. We had control in the house though. That‚Äôs flipped though
Yeah, I mentioned some of that elsewhere in this thread.
I like Abram wayyyy more that Rapp. I hope we can snag Abram so we can use our first two picks to fill other holes.
I have insomnia too thanks for the recommendation, always on the look out for helpful podcasts and meditations 
I borrowed an old wedding dress from a museum. It was a one size fits all kind of dress. Thank goodness!
No, treating it like it‚Äôs obligatory just means it‚Äôs a standard I have. People are allowed to have standards. 
I spent a week in Ottawa one night. Amazing architecture but awful, filthy, drug infested city. Terrible ppl and a dirty trash hole.
Yes I'm sure lol every god has flaws that's what keeps them balanced
She looked the wrong way on a one way street. How are you that stupid.

Palms had a rough game against PHL. Seems a bit off lately.
I know right?! My parents are extremely proud & grateful they don't have to help me pay debt.

Please ask questions about moving to Denver in the Q&A sticky, thanks! Short answer: no 
Kawhi and Siakam chemistry

That sucks. You could start one yourself if you like.
I‚Äôm surprised I had to scroll this far down
They gave me free Subnautica which is an incredibly wonderful game so I'm pretty darn happy. And it's not exclusive.

-Binge eat something -Work -Sleep Usually in that order.
Schoolboy Q. - that part That [NAME] feature is intense :D

[NAME] thinks [NAME] for [NAME] is a bad deal for the Bulls.
We've always been at war with Eurasia what are you talking about?

Like many TIFU posts, I don't believe this one.
Also N.e.r.d and [NAME] reference lmao
U/scottgal - thank you! Coming from southern US, wanted to make sure!
It's a great town.
It's prevalent in everything. WoW was incredible when it came out *because* everyone was garbage.
I think you may just be an asshole/moron bud... sorry.
It‚Äôs still not working unfortunately :(, you have a link to your YT?
Always down for some Liverpool love
"I reject that [NAME] can't defend. Now his legs being gone, that might ""have legs"" "
oh cool! Must be tiring for [NAME] though. Looking forward to watching them!
Fun fact: Ch√° qƒ´ng Êü•Ê∏Ö (pronoinced cha ching) is chinese for checkout.
I made one comment, and you came in to call it childish..... like, what else are you doing besides badgering?
British would annoy me more. Or being called British Isles
They are both owned by the same parent company and they probably wanted to get their money's worth since Taco Bell isn't really prevelant in EU
If it was super easy to get citizenship. I would love to.
I won‚Äôt but if I tell him to have a threesome didn‚Äôt I open the door for him to cheat
Ha ha ha. That was a good one
I love how [NAME] delivers the Italian lines.
Takes all characteristics, good and bad

It is genuinely hard to imagine what the Magic basketball experience will be like when these two legends are no longer in their roles.

If you have a pelvic kidney and some back pain, I know of the perfect hospital in Florida for you.
trust me, that's an unnecessary edge in this league. Also, it's not like the projections on Yahoo are much better for most players.
I'd worry about traffic more than the TSA.
[NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME].
I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
Yet again; totally missing my point.
[NAME] THIS IS CANON
You legitimately sound like a hipster.
Whaaaat? I thought it was a perfectly normal childhood disease that posed no threat whatsoever! Why is she scared?
"""Homeopaths love it!"""
Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
Ambien your posts are delightful and I have such a hard core internet stranger crush on you.
Ah, alright. Solid lists, but I disagree with appointing a sitting [NAME] with only 2 years under his/her belt.
Cruelty free for animals anyway. ü§¶
Surely it's *a* factor. It's just not sufficient. [NAME] had a good life before he went jihadi.
Drive around Belle Meade Highlands; you might be able to get lucky on an older rental home.
Google specific articles with figures and data for me, I'll wait.

Those pearls are the worst, ugh.
Gonna give up your best friend for a g huh? I'm glad we aren't friends.

When they touch my arm or shoulder while talking. Usually they do it with no sexual intent at all, but it still gives me butterflies. 
I think the appearance cheapens the brand. Seriously, 90 Day Fianc√©??? Do the marketing people [NAME] watch these people? 
Be strong. I've felt the same way before in my living situation. I hope things go your way, keep us updated!
The paratrooper theme fits very well with his jump! Keep up the good work.
Could not agree more!!
The savior!
Well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo

IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT MAMA
That's so great! Plus it feels good to know I helped Pfizer make $5B last year on Prevnar 13.
haha not bad my man
Don't forget the part where [NAME] doubts himself or goes off on his own and fails. Then [NAME] tells him how much she loves him and to run
Wow! I never saw it that way. Thank you so much :)
I want a steamed ham with a combo of an Eichel tower call or an Ultralord goal.
That Man has one of the coolest tattoos on his knee I've ever seen.
Maybe try a flashlight next to her bed, so she can turn it on and look around if she gets scared?
Are socdems welcome here?

Yay!!! Finally the fix we're all looking for after hours of endless scrolling.
I don‚Äôt know man I feel like this goal is just a combination of unluckiness
I‚Äôll take ‚Äúthings that didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù for $800, [NAME].
Oh ok! Thanks for the info.And oh [NAME] I can‚Äôt imagine what that would feel like
I'd love to see something following her younger days. Also something STRQ related would be awesome.
No no. totally justified
Every year, consistently, once I turned 18. What a world.
"It looks like those ""true facts"" memes are coming back, too. SHUT IT DOWN, OTTO."
This is me being hopeful that there‚Äôs not one poor soul out there who‚Äôs happy that the Wilpons are our owners
Still a bit of redesign & this would look much better.
Why am i reading all these different
This shit got me rolling LMFAO
Actually whoosh doesn't apply here because the criteria for whooshing is different.
That's a surprise from this guy.
Unfortunately, on the stupid official Reddit mobile app it doesn‚Äôt work. I miss my Android and Reddit Is Fun app
This is clearly the world's most dangerous gang
Omg lmao. Coming from [NAME] too is super embarrassing. I can't really say I feel bad for [NAME] though, he did it to himself. 
Bring back [NAME] and Big Dell!
Happy just came out
Also his weird spiked haircut. I wanted spiked hair when I was like 6. I also wanted a mohawk. I'm not 6 anymore.
Yeah, the content is bad enough but the financing is on a whole other level of sketchy. 
Twilight... STILL a better love story than The Last Jedi!
That's cool! That's definitely one way to look at itl
Kill trading is still bad imo but i agree that losing the round was correct
That's the most obvious lie I've seen all year...
Did she even pass the formidable Blechdel Test?
The cruise boat one (similar) where the water goes WELL over the porthole scares the everloving shit out of me every time
I love the neck movement at the end üòÇ
So can [NAME]
Stick your -isms up your ass.
Completely miss-wired! I never thought a kid can grow up miss-wired.
I don't think any game mode has a guarantee anymore. I five stacked last night in unranked and waited 15mins for a game. TL feels the shortest
Live your life well. Let them figure it out for themselves.
I'm rank 6 and get destroyed for using legion, what build do you use? I absolutely love legion just here getting ran over
Just life.. I feel like i'm just a parasite that should be removed.
I don't find anything about women appealing.

And still our government is not responsible enough to pay its bills. It's rather pathetic.
Lol dream on buddy. You‚Äôve had enough attention today. Actually learn what your talking about helps a lot. Sorry your stuck in free roam smokin crack
At least now [NAME] has more time to gain his confidence
Nobody would flop like that in practice
What? I didn‚Äôt understand a thing of what you said.
[NAME] I hate that I had to upvote this dude to the sub it is in. Every fibre of my being wants to downvote this atrocity
I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
Wow. Yes. But here I am. On my phone. Responding.
And then peeing on them. I came, I saw, I peed.
Parents should at the very least monitor the childrens activity or put an adult block on the websites
That was the most remarkable thing, how fluid her conversations were, without a trace of shyness.
Sweet now I can stop reading 20 different articles about about X Y and Z
[NAME] making moves, as much as I still miss [NAME] I'm excited to see our teams future.
The game is riddled with error messages.
Crossposting is a terrific feature on Reddit. I'm happy if someone does it to me because it means more people will read one of my posts.
well we all know what a complex meal sandwiches are! hahaha
No because all you have done is paraphrased the title of the CMV.
I second that. What goes up must come down. And to OP, i hope you find peace and clarity. Good luck!
I‚Äôd love to get an update on what happened! (When you are ready)
Removed under rule #1. This is your second removal for the same rule.
Blizzard: WELCOME TO OVERWATCH! WHERE WE NERF TANKS/SUPPORTS FOR SHITS AND GIGGLES! ^(orisa is up next...)

This needs to be a series. Start a series. For the love all that's holy on reddit, please...make a series.
You would forget the price of such things and not care, too.
TIL when your fiancee steals 500 from you to buy products that harm you physically by being in the home due to allergic reaction you're controlling her.

No but it would be weird if you masturbated to it like I did
"Yeah, I was like ""man I love [NAME] so much but [NAME] is also amazing and good"""
We sincerely hope not.
[NAME] didn't contribute anything! [NAME] or [NAME], please come back. At they least you do something on the court!
I don‚Äôt think they really thought through the ramifications of putting a bunch of angry women through rigorous physical exercise with weapons. That uprising would be glorious!
Wow I‚Äôm glad I live in Cali
This is what I assumed, but I haven't seen any confirmation of this anywhere.
I dont think anyone said it would make the game better, it won't, but it certainly won't make the game any worse either 
[NAME]. Gun crimes are pretty much unheard of on that side of the pond, isn't it? RIP.
Filthy birdbrain-loving scum barely deserve the bullets needed to boot them off the mountain. Moreiya 4 life
Just in case anyone wants to know what [NAME] spent their day doing.
that missed dunk is so symbolic of [NAME] lol
"Some do, others say ""Thanks""..."
I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.
Search President Dump, [NAME] and [NAME]. Honey you fine af compared to those turds.
I just renewed my license today and they didn't check my proof of address, just looked at my us passport, license, and debit card
So they're just not going to change it like they did in the Louisville game? That's cool..
Lack of a dart board.
VR Mechwarrior would be awesome
Tell me when you find out how to bowser-wobble

This is absolutely precious
Good luck to you! Also good job for standing up for yourself

Eyebrow zits are the worst. I'd rather have a lip pimple than an eyebrow pimple. Also part of the fanclub for your eyes.
But...but...I just bought a new gun in Fallout '76.....and America is the centre of the universe!! :'(
Please don‚Äôt do that. You can do better
I'm sorry [NAME]. I won't do it again.
You are stating your opinion as if it were fact. [NAME] has face tattoos and I think they are incredibly sexy, attractive and appealing.
I feel like I‚Äôve seen these before... but when I was very little
This is his worst season since his rookie year
Sure, they can help nurse [NAME] back to health. 
TLDR; we get many drizzle days and our summers are amazing.
Someone who evidently doesn‚Äôt really know much about football or doesn‚Äôt do a simple google search before posting.
Idk how tf he was able to play on pot and booze that sounds hard af to do
Only [NAME] could claim that shutting down the thing he is in charge of is a success.
I‚Äôd burn my hand for nothing if it meant keeping my family alive and safe.
Ahahahahahaha!!
Yeah Eagles definitely had the upper hand in the negotiation but there‚Äôs no way we were gonna waste a season with [NAME] at QB.
Is it... alive?
That‚Äôs a good way of putting it
I did the same with a group of buddies. Nonetheless, Happy New Year!
He was a bony old bastard and probably jealous of their big cat energy.

Looks gorgeous on u üòçüòç
"Yeah, I'm happy to help an actual friend in need, but not some distant acquaintance ""friend""."
Why do you want it to be the world's leader and savior, outta broken and needs some alone time. 
You don't even deserve my attention anymore. Bon voyage sucka
I apologize for doubting you.
Yes it is child abuse. It‚Äôs sexist too.
That sub sounds boring as fuck.
Maybe she was having a bad day. But then again at least say hi.
You can start your life over any time you want. I think the secret is to not let failure keep you from trying again.
Yeah no haha. Out of my price range tbh
I'm crying laughing in the cubes.
Great post. ( you are learning to let it go)
Where are [NAME] and [NAME]??? Time to kick some butts!
You'll win in the long run by not shutting up.
I wanna add on that the perk I was talking about is on the dagger from the pack, which you can get standalone for 250 helix points
Take an updoot for making me smirk and smile. It might be immature, but it's hilarious.
So does [NAME], so much for him being a Thibs guy.
Get better photos!
You must be really slow. Life must be hard for you. You have my pity.
"That's a nice way to say ""being forcibly removed as illegal immigrants.""."
Thank you for correcting me on these! I have taken them down. I will do more research in the future.

Ok. Well it's just an opinion. Maybe TCU will get it done.
No one is required to help anyone.
That‚Äôs Wikipedia, isn‚Äôt it? So not quite official.

Just invite him in on opening day and close the door, seal it up for 2000 years and that will be the end of the matter.
Wow.... So many people here apparently don't know poly relationships exist.... Just say thanks. Why would it be weird?
Looks interesting, I'll definitely keep an eye out for it when it's closer to release. 
You‚Äôre looking at hard time mate
You know more liberals want more gun control than regular [NAME] do, right? 
As a lover of PG and Scrubs, I've not seen this one. What a genius tongue in cheek celebration to [NAME], [NAME] and PG.
Out of curiosity, what do you see in Verdugo that gets you to legendary?
It‚Äôs a visual novel too
Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
Lmao you didn't address anything the other guy said. Yet you wonder why no one takes people like you seriously.
> [NAME] mother allegedly vandalized [NAME] grave, stating that she had ruined her son's life. No....
I wish I could believe in myself
I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.
Lafc fan lurking our sub... lol typical plastics.
I came here to laugh at memes. Not feel feels

Thanks made feel a bit better
Just don‚Äôt buy a sports car and you‚Äôll be fine
I feel like the world would be a vastly different place if the make up wearing roles where reversed
[NAME] is 16 and [NAME] is 19... But she's looks 16 as [NAME] 0.0
I have. Take care
Shoulda told her to come watch it at ur place
I wish they didn‚Äôt hate [NAME] so much. Feels bad to play her.
This is oddly fitting now you have to do DR2 and V3
I was joking about a broader trend I've noticed.
The problem with that it would show how the comics end and people would hate that
I played that one. It was really fun(at least to me, as a kid).
There's also a massive pile of newspapers in his front yard!
If the uncertainty bothers you then you probably need to have the dtr talk. Also be aware that conversation could end the situation if the other party gets uncomfortable
More camo pants!
Nicknames like that get me all hot and bothered.
I actually have the complete collection so I can play any of them when I want to!
Oh dear. Yah, start with the criminal lawyer then - custody won‚Äôt be an issue if you‚Äôre in jail. :-/
Maybe he just never wanted to be a head coach and was content with being a defensive coordinator? Either way, I‚Äôm excited!
Yes, this is karma farming and it is disgusting to do that, BUT the title *could* be correct. It probably is made up though. 
"To be fair, ""Junior"" was released 25 years ago."
Procter & Gamble is the parent company. Keep that in mind when you're picking your stocks.
"Don't say ""no comment"". Say ""I would like to talk with an attorney before talking with you."""
Where in that sentence did I mention US backed CIA coups? You're fucking shameless.
"Okay. Then what does ""anti-imperialism"" mean to you? "
Can't believe this game actually released in the state it's in complete joke , should be criminal
I honestly feel he doesn't want to over burden her so that she hails on him yet again.
That sounds plausible. Lets hope that you are wrong for both countries' sake.
It appeared that she smacked her grape pretty damn good. Oh, and I chuckled. 
Not looking for anything serious ‚â† rejection
Honestly the rarity is fine, I find it once every 25 games but the health needs work. 
This is like taking over a buddy's girlfriend so that he can hook up with the girl you really wanted in the first place.
Crying? Yeah i like crying C-calling R-out Y-for I-serious N-mental G-treatment
So you're saying the penalty for DUI is the same as texting and driving? Because that's what I've been saying it isn't true.
The Four Agreements is amazing and life changing. I don't keep that many books in my library, but this one has made the cut.
Become friends with people who work night shift. We are always up at crazy hours and need a distraction from our work.
"Maybe crotch-thrusting ""power pose"" on top of the White Cliffs will scare them all away?"
Forgot to mention that it contains lanolin, don't know if thats a deal breaker. Regardless, alcohol free emollient + occlusive is the way to go
They must do it giving their population and productions but we must remember that they are not the only responsible of their pollution.

Thank you so much for the wonderful compliment, glad you enjoy it!
That's fair. Seems pretty lefty heavy, though.
What an awful last 10 minutes. Can't even make one pass to someone.
Ik these are great!
Avoid Blount St and Martin Luthur King or risk death. I‚Äôm not kidding.
Steven universe is a kid‚Äôs show that is also aimed at adults. A very intense 1 hot episode aired last night and people are excited.
Aww, thank you [NAME] for capturing me!!
[NAME] makes me want to punch ugly pillows.
Good luck bro! I am with you on this journey. Currently on day 7. I had trouble sleeping yesterday night due to the urges.
The irony tho
[NAME] would go down in the first game
Omg this is great.
Because sometimes the middle is still wrong
That is brilliant.
I thought it was a bachelorette party. Re-reading it appears it isn't, which makes her reaction even more immature.
Thanks for the info! Safe scooting.
Come back when your dad rock genre manages to produce icons like [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME]. Now bye [NAME] 
Huh I would figure the Royce's have been lost in the shuffle of thousands of characters introduced since Waymar, rather than a late bloomer.
Keep them until November, and then return them. 
I prefer HOWDY MISTER
I like that he keeps with the Cardinals‚Äô colors. This needs to be an alternative uniform
Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
She‚Äôs not even on vacation anymore!
Shut up and dance
Well, that one time, I was very constipated...
You forgot evolution
Isn‚Äôt /politicalhumor a sub that barely has any real activity though...?
3 is a really significant number for the Super Bowl, I don't think it will budge.
From the east side of the river into Hartford, it isnt bad. My commute into downtown would only be 15-20 minutes coming from Vernon. 
But also the smell!! People go past KFC and say Mmmm I must get some lol
Stop. The Bulls played great tonight.
Of course it can be charity. If the rent is lower than the market rate, the difference is charity. 
I'm appalled that your roommate straight up destroyed perfectly good leftovers that way
I like Brown Sugar
Imagine wanting a crock-pot that cooks enough for one person. What's the point?
This is the sweetest.
this is my new favorite phrasing. I've been calling it bingemas since about mid-December.
I found a dentist (Aspen Dental) that text or email confirms every appointment and my doctors office has an app for everything from appointments to prescription refills.
Cool story bro
Funny I‚Äôm on my second play through and this happens...
Tell him congrats. And that he srsly needs to work on his bunting; it's just painful to watch.
I'll admit that's a bit surprising, since it's such a massive international hub. But beggars can't be choosers I guess. 
Im so sorry
I think there was a reason, there was for me. I saw her as far too power-hungry and completely full of herself.
[NAME] and clutch free throws are arch Nemesis
Just take them and get them vaccinated without his knowledge. Only one parent is needed. Dont even tell him after it's done.
"It's more like ""Get tinder or any of the apps and get rejected hundreds of times a day"""
People put their lives at risk trying to rescue them.
Oh yeah, it's really dehumanizing to have respect for people's private property and not steal it from them whenever we feel like it...
Dude I spit after this comment. I haven‚Äôt laughed like that in awhile.
[NAME] leans so far forward when he skates we love a king of physics and momentum üò§
It is a cult, and if the cultists don't keep feeding the delusion they will start doubting their beliefs. 
sad knight noises...
That was nasty... but also the most real thing I‚Äôve seen on the show lately.. lol
You may be onto something. Strange that I agree with this now.
This makes me happy. Happy new year everyone
The only thing I find disconcerting about this is that you use tongs to stir the pan.
[NAME] is hot garbage on that court. He has been the biggest disappointment of any player this season.
Same, hopefully it‚Äôs there in 15 years so people have the opportunity to look at it and pick a different brand.
[NAME] about to dip out real quick
I don‚Äôt think you can be compelled to testify against someone else over a traffic violation, I would just feign ignorance
Really? Wow I was sure they were huh. Even still I feel like he needs berserker light damage for that sword
except that he can't, he already played a South American U20 with Argentina which cap ties him.
Most valuable comment
Thanks for the recommendation! This goes straight to the top of my audible queue.
Oh sorry on my phone auto correct. Which does jobs you focus on one person ensuring that they are ok
Oh definitely!
I was just thinking how normal his legs and feet look!
I love me some Cat but someone clearly never read The mists of Avalon
Scary stuff.
She might just be insecure. You do have a bit of an age difference, so she might feel like she doesn‚Äôt match up to you.
You're not, because I don't either. But I can still search Twitter. You know what else I found? Your evidence was deleted.
i was on there back during the primaries and it certainly WAS satire, but then [NAME] started banning everyone who wasn't insane 
I love polo shirts
Kids at heart.
The space between the M and the E always looks a tad too long with these cheaper jerseys.
I watched a couple Titan games. He used [NAME] and [NAME] very well. That alone gets me excited.
Thanks for the help!
Now you know which cars to wreck into !
I guess you‚Äôve become something of an icon
picture isnt that clear but I am 80% sure they're fake. break one and see how it crumbles.
I'm confused why you reposted this from this sub. I'm even more confused why you left evidence that shows this.
How old are you? Do you get free housing and healthcare?
The [NAME] finger wag was sexy as hell.
I am a dishonest and disrespectul
He looks like [NAME]
Sorry, should've mentioned... 
Do you mean commentaries on the stories?
Um, trump got peed on. 
Better start believing in miracles then! LOL
Good to know, and it gladdens my heart to hear you're all right! <3 
That says to me that he believes you are the issue, not his mother.
No, it's because of the misogyny that's often present in the community. 
Thanks! Would trollgc work too?
*Whispers* I dunno man, it's a hard decision
Geez, we still got about an hour left lol
He figured it out this offseason. He just didn't have any chemistry deep with his receivers and didn't know the playbook
To be fair, spinners are supposed to be very small pornstars, not BBW like trump.
Interesting, thanks for clarifying.
All i want is to be able to grab pig from an island and let it run freely on my deck
Left the spasms behind long ago, we're now at full on convulsions
Bah gawd that drop step fake pass turnaround jumper is [NAME] move! They really love each other!
This is such a dumb statement considering the Rams have benched [NAME] for [NAME] with a ton of success.
literally wasn‚Äôt the worst effort of the season
I wish this was animated.
>he definitely doesn't value my pleasure this is very sad
No R movies or tv shows, no buy from me. But I‚Äôm sure people with kids will love it.
I wouldn't be caught outside after sunset anywhere in this city.
I really hope [NAME] or [NAME] or somebody from the show sees this üòÇ
My father has been dead for two years and it's still been difficult to not talk about him as if he's still alive.
 [NAME], the worst Premier in Ontario, although [NAME] is a close second. 
Money is always going to exist sorry
Oh look, another SHG against. Must be a day that ends in -y.
Boy I *sure hope* this isn't a weekly thread, how obnoxious, haha
Oh lord that's nasty. Guess I'm getting some fried chicken tonight.
It's in my top 3 songs, with heard em say, and through the wire. Such great tracks
"Ah the classic ""I don't deserve you"" argument."
So unsatisfying that it didn‚Äôt end with a pit maneuver.
She is smiling in the picture and, to add insult to injury, seems pregnant in the video.... 
>who accused him and [NAME] of raping her then did a porno where she fucked both of them AND [NAME]? She did?
Oh [NAME] !!!
[NAME] comment has me laughing
Loved seeing [NAME] play for us, but definitely excited to see what [NAME] can do.
The sad result of far too many gamers needing addiction mechanics to continue playing one of the greatest card games of all time.
her section at the tate museum is amazing
Back in the day was the best ever than. I giggled nearly to the point of drenching my depends. Ty ty very much.
Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don‚Äôt know if those facts are even rightüòÇüòÇ
Was there a new episode this week?
Anytime I've taken benzo beforecoke, it completely negates any coke feeling
Well, it feels like the other truths would be more pertinent. If they don‚Äôt know what it is, then what is it?
Thanks, I hate it
he ignored a question I asked him as well he is not big into responding.
Was that before or after he murdered over a million [NAME]?
Well the house is burnt out so there's not a lot happening with it expect probably insurance folks need to investigate the damage.
Yeah I am seeing a therapist. I should probably talk this out with them next week.
For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome 
Just goes to show how stupid they are
I wasn‚Äôt a fan of theirs on the show, but I am very happy for them both and wish them the best of luck in life 
Holy shit! No way in hell I'd get that close to DFW in a Cessna!
$15 a month for a music service is more than Netflix. Thank u, next!
[NAME] AND [NAME] ARE SO GOOD AT DRAWING FOULS ON 3'S
You're with him, you brought him here to kill me.
KAT doesn't play defense lol
Thanks love <3
Like the [NAME] twins, I guess.
Yep. That's what made me kiss my SO for the first time. Those eyes. I don't think I'll ever forget.
180 is not good for checking enzyme deficiency which is what I am referring too.
"""in2"" Is this a time saver over ""into""? This reporter says no."
The junkies that hang around there can make some good jokes about getting blitz'd
"Welp, my bad. Searched for ""new year"" and didn't see this so posted."
So it‚Äôs part of a series? Because I feel like [NAME] is in every other video game in this art style
yeah, I agree. it‚Äôs just annoying hahaha but thank you so much!!! (: 
It‚Äôs not really a surprise that sick people consume more healthcare resources than people who aren‚Äôt sick, is it?
9 days to beat it before the DMC 5 demo releases and consumes my life.
Can you link an example? I‚Äôm curious now
I literally didn‚Äôt but ok
that's a pretty cool box art. Shame the beetle's hand isn't actually wrapped around the stick though.
Well this hurt tonight but it could have been worse. Plus the bears choked. LOL. Offset the hurt a bit.
The remaster comes with all DLCs from the original.
A machine would literally do a worse job than him.
About every direction, down gives you the same problem as up and every other direction is less effective to escape.
Congrats man! Which troop are you on?
Jeez this would be such a turn off to try and help people in the future
I mean China, India, and Pakistan have nukes and won't exactly take being exterminated lightly.
Another joke?
This sounds like prime /nononoyes material. Glad the cardiac issue your mom has were detected now and not later.
Well [NAME], you got the wrong guy. I never downvoted you. I hope your day gets better.
My vote... snow will mainly be in the mountains. Good thing to help with the summer drought.
[NAME] pretty famous for that. I love the show but there is an entire episode that is blatant anti-nuclear energy fear mongering.
This is the most beautiful story I've ever heard.
Thanks. At first I read it as party
All my brother, I'm not talented haha I just steal the credit. 
Oh sh*t guys I got banned
Ahh, that's why I love my country. 
You don't think it be like that but it do...
The 100,000 who died in the Tokyo bombing during WWII weren't killed by [NAME], it was just the passive spreading of fire. Fuck off, genocide apologist. 
Last time I saw it tested, it beat BO4 and was on par with Fortnite
Thank you for the solid advice üëç I‚Äôve had about a year of creative highs so maybe my brain just needs a break
I gotta try that with my posse next time I‚Äôm on. That‚Äôs hilarious
I just enjoy using intelligent words...? I left him
Whoever is breeding and seeking out these inbred animals is vile.
Left handers are rejoicing over this
Sending love! Feel free to update me on progress if it helps! illegitimi non carborundum!
You forgot our dear friends from Paris
Imagine if we dont trade [NAME] and [NAME] fans just kill all of us.
"I want this back ""I want us back"" I missed the part where that's my problem"
Both directions? They should all be arrested. This will cost the people of Edmonton a lot of time and money. Fuck these pricks.
Oh man, I just realized my city taxes are paying for [NAME] nonsense! 
the media ruined a kid's life for no reason
Seriously? Where the fuck did that sink come from?
deleted ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5933 ^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?
I expect him to perform similar to 2017, though I'm hoping he breaks out (3~4 WAR).
Chromie, for sure
Surely the error is lexical. And I think the original comment is poor (non native) idiom use
is solid proof
Same here, i hope my upcoming trip is gonna kill me
Could be worse, could be funky town
get your ass to mars!
"they'll just finger point at [NAME] being a ""war hawk"" despite her not having any power in over 6 years"
This is what I love about cats
Best thing about making moonshine is the ether vapors you get to collect :)
I love the title of it - ‚ÄúEverything Is Going to Be Okay‚Äù
At least it looks like you're prepared for a good evening in spite of being ghosted:-)
Just out of curiosity are you in the military?
Invite expired.
That game was one of the craziest I‚Äôve ever been to
You mean me? Said the same thing as you did lol
I am real excited for this, I just hope they don‚Äôt ruin it.
But it does? Admittedly it does take a couple days and a few friendly reminders
Do you have arthritis yet? To me it seems my arm wouldve fallen off doing this.
I'll try and search there. Thanks. Edit: it looks like a bunch of vampire story weebs but whatever
This seems to be a dog whistle.
Well ‚Äòhanging with the bros‚Äô is happening either way. It‚Äôs what I do in the morning.
That's not irony. Just coincidence. (I know this is [NAME] tweet).
Oh for sure. Hopefully all 4 make the play offs. Pretty sure Leinster are nearly there already, the absolute madlads.
There are Cubs fans that died at 95 without ever having seen their favorite team win a title. At what point is the LOILTY worth it?
This is pretty misleading. The drop is in comic sales profits for Star Wars and Marvel. They're not failing, they just not as profitable.
Reading this reminds me of the witch hunt scene in Holy Grail. Thanks Daily Beast!
Better than I do about [NAME].
Those dont seem exclusive....try both
No op. No one had ever done that.
"""Lehner"""
[NAME] on stand-by. 'Til All Are One!
Not sure wether to downvote because it's bad, or upvotes because that's the point
I try to switch it up, too; probably the main reason for the post. Gets boring sometimes!
I wanna have sex with him in my normal body to see what that's like.
Great nb rimiru

Come to Nashville. Love to help with that problem.
IVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO CAMPAIGN FOR A CANDIDATE!! I stg im so happy shes my congresswoman! finally dumped comstock!!!!
Do you spend the majority of your time scouring shite newspaper articles?
the act of using private companies as platforms to push indoctrination is no less vile than state run companies
OOF. DEAD ON
Fire the ux designers and yes also our beloved [NAME]
I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.
I can hardly hear you over those goal posts moving! Ahhhh the facts! They hurt! They hurt so bad mama!
I think they‚Äôre gonna keep her a surprise.
Happy cake day Mr bot
Belgium is an awesome assignment
Tell them to make their pen√≠nsulas wide enough for my finger
Sounds like you might need some time out in the re-education camp. You are getting frighteningly close to realizing that our system is designed to keep you imprisoned.
This one's pretty fucking funny. Also LOL to that kid with that shotgun. The kick would break his shoulder in half.
My meme coins are starting to hit the 70% growth range from the beginning of the month. I'm feeling bullish.
I want one....i dont care who.... Unarmed charecter
[NAME], was a hero. I just, could~~n‚Äôt~~ see it. 
great weed, terrible vaccination rates.
My boy [NAME] <3
Cheers! :)
But not if you've accepted rent from him, which it appears you have. 
Unfortunately this is just as illegal as impeding traffic all over the city.
Lol dont mess with [NAME]!
It's fairly good
Oh no atleast you found out early. I went to find help a year ago but you know i stopped going to that therapist
I really love [NAME]
When we have tens of millions starving or dying of thirst, at least you will still have the moral 'high ground'.
Oh, I'm dying to know if you noticed any reaction from him!
23 minutes! Omg that's too long
This is great! My SO just groaned so much at this. Thank you
Pls end me
They're mad
Yep, still fun to theorise though!
Facebook starter pack: Post Condescending disagreement with juvenile name-calling Repeat step 2 over and over and over and over agsin
Maybe? But his foot goes waaaay up lol. Maybe I'm just blowing smoke, idk much about good QB form
Oh, you sweet summer angel.
Side deflects are stupid hard to pull off imo also because you might be used to 500ms lights or slower heavies for deflects his 600ms lights might throw you off
Seeing happy people isn't motivating because it shows how easy it is and how I'm failing at something literally everyone else on the planet can do
Enjoy wes virginnie
Bedside report is terrible.
You‚Äôre being downvoted for making a moronic comment - not for your ‚Äúheroic‚Äù efforts here fedora...
Oh you know they‚Äôre BOTH going for it.
Yes he said that. But it can be quicker.
450 coast to coast at WM!!
WHAT that's heresy - how can you get BTS and EXO mixed up ü§£ Although I would die if they collabed! Can you imagine [NAME] rapping with [NAME] üòç
We had fantastic spacing that possession. Clearing all the defenders to the left side of the court so that [NAME] had a completely open lane to the basket.
You're pushing me to adopting irrational and nonsensical beliefs! dogs are cats now!
Not to mention the fact, that he's casually smoking a cigarette 3 inches away from an infant.
100%. This is made up. If her claim was true, she'd have it on video. 
THANK YOU SOMEONE SAID IT!!
Nobody ask me about the day I've had.
I‚Äôm gonna stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes! Maybe that‚Äôll teach you a lesson.
I'd love an updated Garris!
Sometimes I think the Padres link these rumors just to remind the world they still exist. ... But it would be fun if they actually came true.
Fuck that doll. Energizer bunny from hell.
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs soup chef.
"THANK YOU! You should be able to set a preference before your cut that says, ""no small talk please""."
No. Utterly despicable cult with no redeeming value.
I mean I would be a [NAME] and I‚Äôm pretty reasonable.
It's a shame cause I spent countless hours squading up on BF1, then played the BF5 beta with high expectations only to be very let down.
I‚Äôve been hurt too many times for it all to have been for nothing
I love how the tires are Raiders logo

Glad to hear it. You deserve your best life without that abuse and negativity.
Can't fire everyone if everyone is on strike.

Your repeated need to retreat into victimhood is a snooze.
[NAME]. Who hurt you?
Thanks for the suggestion, I‚Äôll definitely have to hit that up once it gets a little warmer!
This looks like it was written by someone‚Äôs desperate to be ‚Äúdown with the kidz‚Äù mother.
Omg. It's Viv from [NAME] !
Ha! I did have an internal arguement earlier whether to ask him why but thought better of it!
Those other countries clearly exploited to shit? Dats cuz it's not mah [NAME]. -You with your big brain logic.
Hmm thank you. I am not good with words. Can you please elaborate if there is any distinction?
i never liked any star trek but its great listening to them talk about this dumbster fire
And even though it‚Äôs only half carbonated at this point it still gives her those weird wet talking burps.
Of course he can't
Or take it further: Try showering with just hot water. You might be surprised at how clean you get.
I just can't believe she had the nerve to call both [NAME] and [NAME] low ability
I feel truly honored that you gave up the jubilation of being the only person to see that peanut and sharing it with us
Just be good and you won‚Äôt lose, ez
Fair point, [NAME] actually does not know the definition of a good mother, to her affection and spoiling is being a mother.
haha! She is so creepy at times. What a great actress.
There were two attempts. They didn't launch very well
I know of two people who did the Keto and some intermittent eating and got off all meds.
Passing the torch. Lmao. You never made a good one.
Marriage takes 2 to be successful. Love him enough to let him go.
Goalpost shifting much?
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.
Oh man I was being facetious It annoyed me so much
No tweets from [NAME] since 10:30pm EST... twelve hours ago at the time of this writing. Oh, he must be having a GREAT time.
Same here. I appreciate the truckers in this sub and how they emphasize safety.
I hate people who can't *read* Dx
I wanna see [NAME] up there 90 points let's do this
Out of curiosity, is this notion backed up by any evidence?
Man from Czech Republic can't understand why a name common in his neck of the woods is not so common elsewhere.
Niemi locked in holy fuck.

I fear it is already too late if he already uses words that should hurt but really don't because of their misuse.
I love Rocket Love and Blasted. I just wonder who the songs were written for because these are all reference tracks except Acura Intergul
Speaking of the weddings, [NAME] straight up stole [NAME] and [NAME] wedding. Not exactly wholesome. 
You can‚Äôt give me a ticket you didn‚Äôt give that women a ticket for the same thing.
Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I‚Äôd love to be surprised
No problem comrade
Ok cool but where can you study Old Norse? That seems like exactly the type of useless but cool skill I‚Äôd love to have.
Because they want to believe [NAME] is a man, despite them claiming that [NAME] is no man..?
No fucking clue
The Best Argument against RWP/Neocons/Palecons/Libertarians/ClassicLibs is the fact that the American State have indulged in Wars for commodities since its incepcion.

I‚Äôm wondering about those friends of hers that encouraged her to contact you..
Focus on yourself and not on finding a relationship. It sounds like you have a lot of personal issues to work on and are projecting your problems.
Crush. Big crush. Still have it.
Yeah man, did the trick for me. 
Ok but you're still arguing against specific religions not the existence of some type of [NAME], which it almost sounds like you admit could exist
Bam, it's suddenly fixed! Thanks that was great. This is all happening in Bizarro World.
Pretty nice to see CONCACAF signing for the CPL.
Only a [NAME] deals in absolutes.
It does IMO, I like being proud of India and I can not be proud if [NAME] wins.
What a career for TBA. Started on the wing for Qld in 2002 and now playing at prop for the Indigenous side 17 years later.
So prison isn't enough? You want him raped? That's disgusting.
I'm divorcing my narcissistic ex and that book helped me so much!
That‚Äôs disgusting. You should be ashamed of yourself. Banging someone in sales. No excuses for that.
Move on. On another note, dont ever send more than one picture. If she wants to see you she can meet up.
[NAME] bless them and their racist logo
Like I said, stunning. But not at all surprising you would reference [NAME]. 
That was the best time to be Black in LA

It was my impression that Monzo doesn't offer business bank accounts?
My IT professor would love this because he always said that he wanted a brick with good airflow for his case
Nah... i think he made around 90... i tried searching up his pocket, and fuck me...

while her other suitor looks like a decent guy, looks good, trying to be a good bf.
No. Why? Weird question. Unfortunately, the CCP would be suppressing me if I were. Better than ending up in a Xinjiang concentration camp though. 
> Did [NAME] join another mvp Yes
Thank you very much for your time and advice! I‚Äôll consider it greatly for the future!
My jaw dropped
No worries girl it happens hahaha
Nah, I'm good. But thanks.

Calm down. What the hell. I just tryed to tell you that there MEIGHT be a different side to that story.
You okay there, bot?
I mean, is that really a guilty pleasure? It sounds like the coolest thing I have ever heard. 
[NAME] is a lefty. It's the reason why we had [NAME] punch him out in the division series.
I mean, I know you are being sarcastic, but your words are too accurate for something a supporter would actually say

He had to much red dead 2
[NAME] revealed that's what [NAME] called it at a reunion. [NAME] was backstage with steam coming out his ears üòÇ
RemindMe! 3 Days
Well if you're moving to Dallas, it's basically the same thing as Oklahoma and California combined. You're totally safe there!
I love stories that end well. Makes the new year even better.
Just as delusional as [NAME] was. The difference though is [NAME] seems to be putting on an act, tj is just that salty.
AV is a system where if you vote for a loser you can change your mind and 'have another go'. That's the problem.
Indeed. This episode is for me the best one officially. I'm scared for the finale
u/Mickster19 these are incredible! We gotta have this [NAME].

The greatest of all deals.
Well damn wish I could use venom too.
A real bro move, damn. So rare to see nowadays.
>I don't care either way. Good. Then stop making asinine comments on the matter.
It was intentional. Maybe not with much thought behind it, but a very dangerous instinct.
I just physically *shuddered* at the idea of redoing middle school..
Lmaooo I‚Äôm sooo gonna use ‚ÄúAs asap as possible.‚Äù
I skipped the Oilers game for a birthday party for a cat. I‚Äôm glad I did that instead.
ASMR is a weird sexual fetish for incels, and dont let anyone try and convince you otherwise.
Completely right about [NAME], [NAME], [NAME]
Ahh you must be speaking of M & W Industries! I know it well I'll never forget the smell of pickles.
Not a good couple hours. A full 33 days.
Isn‚Äôt that the same as idols? I thought it‚Äôs a big nono for any intercession when it comes to [NAME]. I could be wrong though
To the place
Your ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù is a train wreck at social media. Only skill he‚Äôs shown so far
This has been largely disproven. [NAME] had no problem dropping the bomb and knew it wouldn't change the outcome of the war.
You're welcome :)
Well it would be a man telling a man with no shame how to dress...
Has someone mentioned ghost chips yet? If not, then here they are, because we learnt an important lesson then...
This sub is very very bad at irony
Ok, I gots to know, was the child taken away? Please tell me the child was taken away. 
Why the downvotes?
A surprise, but a welcome one
Thoughts, prayers, and hugs
For the love of [NAME] stop making him relevant. Please.
I have an honest question for you sir. Wouldn't a person who went through that hell be more humble and understanding than someone who didn't?
If this guys name is [NAME] I know him. üòñ
I compleatly get it. It makes me not trust people over the littlest things.
This seems like a good as time as any to ask, what's some hype super robot stuff to check out? I've only ever seen Gurren.
I tried to write a cheque for a fare when I was a teenager. That did not go down well.
Are you fucking serious? That‚Äôs a foul??
Are you sure?
Teenagers are teenagers. We dont really care about our spelling anyways. Unfortunate that everyone who corrects them gets downvoted to the underworld though
If only there was a league of sorts of higher ranked play that they could watch. Oh well.
Isn't that redundant?
I still love figment!
Just change in the stall. I used to do it. No one will say anything to you about it it's normal
That is pretty small damage. I wouldn't fix it either.
This why we can‚Äôt have nice things! I would‚Äôve beat him up for taking with my non-existent mans away üò§
Afro samurai lol, that's pretty interesting never new they actually existed. I'm woman though so that wouldn't work for me 
I ate the PETA idiot who ate a vegan diet and had leftovers of him. He wasn't as tasty as a cow.
That was the moment I fell in love with [NAME]. He was also really good in Frier Fall (Free Fall).
Y‚Äôall some sharks. I‚Äôm really just out here trying to be hopeful for the future of my team after a heart shattering lost.
I mean, who doesnt? But youre right, techgore is not the place for it.
Yeah, she told me about some creepy guy who came by asking about me and licking his lips.
lol, [NAME] i hope not
Instead of dumped underground at a later date, just dumped into the sea earlier. Despicable
Those fingers disturb me the most
Are ya completely sure that's not from that Thursday last summer?
Ded game we should be happy we have a new hero
There's those people that compliment me all the time and you can tell it's so forced and fake and I honestly dont know what to say
We haven't seen him play since last split. I don't know what growth he could possibly be talking about...
That‚Äôs awesome. Feed the gators while getting rid of Pits. Kill two birds with one stone.
You gotta make yourself happy when no one else does
Never argue with religious people. You can't win. They think [NAME] is real after all.
happy new year buddy!
nice try, FBI!
I'm unsure how much more I should invest in this train of thought.
REBOOT FIREFLY!
Don‚Äôt feel bad for playing Minecraft, it‚Äôs still a great game and is starting to get kinda popular again.

I really love the sorta sharp angles you used !
What do you hate about yourself? Here are my guesses. I need to know so I can waste your time and also make you self conscious.
Hahaha its the best kind of protest...save money and stay inside
Sorry the cognitive dissonance is too much for you. Why don't you go back to listening to Nickelback? It'll make you feel better :)
I just don‚Äôt like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home.
"I'm finding it hard to distinguish ""discuss the merits of conspiracy theories"" and ""debating"" those theories."
I'll miss [NAME]
? sometimes i play ffa with my friends to have fun
No Mayo No Care.
THIS BULLSHIT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER. SIGNATURE WIN. [NAME] SMELLS LIKE SHIT AND DOESN'T RECYCLE.
Firstly, thanks for pointing it out, and secondly, you should have some sort of [NAME] nearby, he should do the job
[NAME] playing for the heat always makes me laugh
I agree. But shooting him left me feeling bad too.
i wear all black. always. i died when we launched la boulange pastries. pink shirt of shame.
Huh, Fallout 76 and disaster in the same paragraph....that's not new.

MTV is so dramatic lol ‚Äúbeautiful love story‚Äù
You know what would instantly unwreck you? A good screwing. Transformational !
Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better.
Would be better if not for the stupid gas mask. Should have had it's own comissar cap instead!
> +Beal from last year would have been a 1st/2nd I beg your pardon?
She got the gift that keeps on giving
Sex dolls/robots are gonna replace them any away. Funny that. 10 years ago nobody would have thought that sex workers would be replaced by robots.
LOL. When she came back on after the first commercial break, there was loud beeping when she was talking. 
cuteee
May regret asking but foid ?
Oh man, the crab brigade hit this thread *hard*
At the same time, if the camera quality is so shitty you can be certain the mic is too.
I'm curious, too. 
So the key to living is to do nothing?
Sounds fun, is it?
And [NAME] himself wrote a tearful, pissy PM to the commenter 
You ain't stoppin me *insert insult used by outlaws to mock sheriffs *
I agree, not to say he would be a favourite but [NAME] is very hittable, one good headkick is all it takes
True. I'm not from the US so i dont know how they would go about enforcing this law.
I firmly believe that at least 30% people on that subs are just trolls to make the other 70% look like idiots.
> set suggested.
I like your answer and good on ya, love me some [NAME]!
What tickles me is how much you seem to dislike [NAME], despite being exactly like him lol
We've been bamboozled
Ewgh don‚Äôt remind me.
It's still interesting to watch though ... from far away, with no personal involvement whatsoever.
Forget 20/10, [NAME] all about that 10/20.
Great advice here. Good sleep doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújust happen‚Äù with kids. It‚Äôs our job as parents to guide them.
[NAME] just needs to split it up more resting him earlier
thats not good
Edit: Four on Five now man! Woo!
I must've missed them. Looking again but if you have a moment can you link it?
My mom thinks this neighborhood is safe, and I kinda don't want her being more paranoid but I feel like I should do SOMETHING.
Me too! And he was so happy to get that out of her back, he seems like he really cares.
This made me sad. I hope you find happiness.
[NAME] has no jump at all. If he‚Äôs injured he should sit and get better.
Maybe he thought they meant HOKEY!!!! Like ‚Äúthe hokey pokey‚Äù. Lol
My mother was missing a left leg and my wife was missing a right leg, now they will be able to walk normally

Please, stop
I kind of love the rabbit
Might get hate for this but I'm reeeeaaaaaally not a fan of [NAME]. I don't know why, but I just don't LIKE her

I'm as big a packers fan as the next guy, but that car is ugly lol
I'm not even surecwhat it is why do people hate it?
Because you can just leave her and start a new life for yourself, if she does not want to abort but you do, it‚Äôs her problem
Roids are a lot more harmful than makeup.
Same! They got into my PayPal and tried to steal $1,000.

You seem nice but things will remain this way until someone makes a decision based on your coworker being incompetent and lazy.
How dare you do [NAME] like this.
I will help ol' [NAME] the right price
I feel like if [NAME] is that bad you bring in a traffic cone before [NAME]
Or dry them and press them into a book!
At this point one can only hope.
Play dumb all you want, you know what that has to do with it.
I buried the hatchet with them last year. Phuck Philly
Did you noticed they removed my post? Yep.
Well that made me want to continue to live in Alberta.
Ehhh, it's an opinion, it's not wrong or right, just highly unpopular and ill-informed.

Having high empathy is great, but I'm still trying to figure out what to do with it.
Yeah yikes I have no idea what happened there .... :(
me too. it's a way of keeping distance. feels too intimate to use someone's name.
Why shouldn't you
I'm very motivated to make things as easy/optimized as possible so that I can be as lazy as possible.
[NAME] was a pleasant surprise. It might be something you'll enjoy.
Oh good god. This is not what makes someone Minnesotan. Or backtrack. This might be the exact type of post that makes someone look Minnesotan.
It‚Äôs also extremely expensive and school options are limited. Just a thought, I‚Äôm all about advancing your career:)
Right? Don't want to get my hopes up for a rumor.
OMG I totally forgot about that episode. What a nightmare
Ever seen Paris nowadays?
And who are you on twitch?
He thought that was a good idea...
What a weird character to use for something like this
Having a child has only strengthened my views on abortion rights.

I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :(
Don't ruin it for him
Loooooool what?
Do you have cash app?
[NAME] cut spending significantly.
I thought it only cost ¬£250m in 2006?
Hard to prop up lies with anything that isn‚Äôt also lies, ya know?
Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
Honey mustard.
[NAME] would be a disaster for the progressive movement. [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME], not much better.
Yes, [NAME] said he was no where near the SUV, which is why the blood in it is so damning to him. 
What a catch, that's how you win championship games there. Wow.
Same here, she left the house we bought and is giving me till the end of the month. Woooo
My girl has slowly been getting more and more into different [NAME] music, but she will always make it a point to play this track. I love it
Your voice is beautiful, the lyrics are beautiful, you‚Äôre beautiful, and I‚Äôm crying. AMAZING JOB
This right here... most of the orders I have done on shipt have not tipped. Not sure why customers feel entitled on that platform.
I still can't believe those guys got nominated.
Everything [NAME] says about [NAME] could also be applied to himself
I think they were always pretty but less visable pretty because being overweight can alter the face.
I've found [NAME] are more weirdly religious about their hockey for some reason. Maybe it's confirmation bias.

I've heard some people get kinda homophobic with the grappling. Sucks when the crowd boo's
Bro, put water in the microwave and see what happens, we're like 70% that shit

I will never forgive and never forget for this one
"If that's true, then you can't call what I would have with option 1 ""omnipotence""."
Ok but wouldnt that make me seem like a loser? Idek how to take good selfies or even where. Obviously not the bathroom right?
There‚Äôs no PR firm in the world that could change her image, especially when she keeps creating fake accounts and being mean to people. 
Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil.
Block him and stop replying to his comments. Not worth it.
This is a toxic behaviour.. get rid of him as soon as possible.
Here you can see for yourselves
Wrong sub.

At that point you might as well pay a visit to his home instead of suing. His house is a google search away.
And yet the guy proclaiming he understands it better than the whole world is trying to justify losing LMAO
Okay perfect! I'll definitely have that conversation with him then. Thanks for the help! :)
Ok good points but you didn't address the issues faced by [NAME]. So you agree with me that losing as [NAME] shouldn't result in lost elo?
I'm running low on everything to get 60. At high im getting 40+, its still an improvement imo. :P

This is amazing man. Congrats and keep em coming
I wonder why you're sitting at -2 for that comment. Very strange.
I'm hoping this is a 12 year old trying to be funny
"Hillbilly is preeetty badly deformed, and he's got a secret brother in his shoulder, referring to him as ""normal"" just ain't right."
Small btc withdrawals are slowly happening. Really curious to know if any large btc withdrawals have been successful.
It's really baffling, they had the perfect template with the Master dialogue in FO1 but they manage to completely butcher it.
Phew! Sounds like he had a close call there :-( :-( :-(
Zero percent. I sit when I piss cause I'm not an animal and I like to keep my bathroom clean.
[NAME] fucking [NAME], that man is enormous.
Upfront. Costs a lot more over the term of the contract though.
Yes! I was lost without subtitles on Sons of Anarchy.
I killed you in VR once. I loved it.
Sorry for your losses. Keep up the awesome work. Your son will remember your efforts and hopefully be part of your life soon
I didn't like the family ending but I liked the Atlantis ending especially as we know we are going to see more of it in DLC2.
Dude. This is exactly what happened to me. I hope you‚Äôre doing well. Hang in there.
Hi Tired, I'm Dad. And I'm very disappointed in you for following your older brother's example and becoming a trap that poses for /b/

Not enough pizza rolls on that plate. How does someone not sit there and eat a whole bag at once, I will never understand
Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
they might have seen me pooping
What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
You don't need to screw your face up like that, it's already screwed up enough.
Just wait until we sign [NAME] this off-season! Best front in the league.
No, that‚Äôs just another way of backing a coup. Sit back and wait. If either side is going too far then offer to help.
The Wall requires taking land at gunpoint, explain how that isn't tyranny
Season x? Sorry bitch but no.
I am so proud of this community.
No it was a joke
Lollll the mental gymnastics required not to be embarrassed by admitting you have to buy someone elses hair.... To put on your heads lol like what hhaaha
Is that [NAME]
Looks eerily like the series of a guy who was unpacked on the street near Star Seeds last night.
Can't wait to see this badboy in season 8 üòç üòç üòç When [NAME] listed him among Dragonpit characters i was so happy. 
Do they seriously think freshman congressmen are 'leadership'?
I honestly don't know but the more attention something gets the less it gets ignored
Knew you weren't from here. I don't believe your story though.
I think it's the pass rush and that nobody can stay healthy and, but it could be [NAME]. He's not the greatest
ATTACH THE STONE OF TRIUMPH!!
I do to! We all heard a huge crash and bang and I ran over expecting the worse. Was truly a miracle
You can make a new Reddit account.
Thank you very much.
Do you feel like being with him is the only way for you to be okay, then?
you're misinformed
Who cares. [NAME] is draining the swamp. Get over it
So she knows of 3 languages, Wonder what they are?
Was injured a lot his rookie year too. And had trouble handling [NAME] duties.
Give me sunshine from Clemson in a few years lol
That pizza looks good
Now THIS IS shitposting
You mean [NAME]?
I'm a university student and even though I have a job, I'm going to find out about this at school. Thanks for the tip!!
"Its supposed to be an ""eye opener"" to those claiming the winning team was lucky. I am not saying either is correct."
Good answer -- thanks!
That was his scripted job. Fake.
This is exactly as I was suspecting. Thank you for the solid advice. I won't go ahead with the sale .
Here's a real example.
You're right, it's relatable. Hope everything's OK for you 
Why don't you just tell us? We're all dying to know!
Gotcha. I'll do a little Google-fu and see what comes up. Thanks anyway!
Worst radio ever.
Can we call it the swamp monster?
I know it's so amazing. Too bad all the people that hate the game haven't thought of giving it a try.
I'll see what I can do, thanks man.

Can't look at batting average. [NAME] 90 wRC+ in 3799 PA [NAME] 92 wRC+ in 4917 PA
C'mon Mr [NAME], you're not going to eat all that watermelon.
He‚Äôs doing this to get some of that lawsuit money
They're the same people who will tell you 600 a day is unhealthy
Am I lost?
E - Either we turn it around and make the playoffs or tank and [NAME] gets fired so win win right?
How dare they soil the good name of sauerkraut with this most rancid picture of it ü§¢
Maybe because [NAME] didn't actually made a joke, he just pretended to be stupid
yeah he was - i also remember him crashing into beltran when he was a Met. Scary play
I think that's also what I'm saying so we're good.
Is that the one with [NAME]?
I need this source with sound
I shave it. Btw great way to cheer me up saying I look like I'm 45 at 23
Oh, exploitable
He absolutely loves it!!
leave bro- this is the exact type of behavior mine displayed.
Haha it‚Äôs funny cuz I‚Äôm 17 and still doing these haha...
Was less worried about spelling and more worried about warning everyone in the match
Sorry, I laughed, not at you, but because this is so perfect and so relatable. Hope you're past it or getting past it. 
im still starving
He now looks like his daughter wearing a fake beard.
The opposite of depression isnt happiness, its vitality.
I understand your point. But I‚Äôd still rather get some stuff stolen than lose a member of the family.
I hate people who have the blinders on when it is one of their friends
There‚Äôs tons of stories of animals taking care of kids....I believe the story! :)
Well if you read my other posts you‚Äôd know I did try to end it in a responsible mature way and he refused sooo
That‚Äôs nuts about the digging. I wish we had better dog boots that fit them more naturally than what we have.
So weird watching this segment knowing what happened a couple days ago.
Man [NAME] played really fucking well I hope this game especially after [NAME] last game establishes him as the starter.
Now take this, cut out 100% of the killing and you have the Swiss Army. 
Then stop electing those officials.
damn all you do is rate other people's submissions? worst reddit user ever, and I've been here nearly 11 years I should know
Just give him his damned complete control of government and media. Just give him his damned concentration camps. give him his damned Final Solution.
Confirmed, word added to Oxford dictionary in 2022. Now to spread the word and get it into general circulation so that this can happen. [NAME].
Oh yeah I saw that trailer before Aquaman
The current way Boba works doesn't warrant his removal enough. [NAME] isn't technically broken, the way the target system works is.
this literally made me sick to my stomach
Awesome footage. The one child signing to look into his eyes looks as though he is jaundiced. His eyes are quite green yellow colour.
I think the best way to communicate that you‚Äôre not sure is not saying anything about it
Glad he's still balling, better than [NAME] for sure. I would have liked to have kept him just cos I liked how hard he played. 
I would not be that mad though. Just disappointed. I am angry at people like you, not the show in itself.
Why do you use your valuable time to hate? We only got time to love each other and ourselves.
Good luck!
I feel a tad lost without it now that my drive for football has vanished and basketball and hockey simmer one. The show's every night after all.
Thanks. I needed to hear that.
I can't tell if its a guy or a girl and i don't know if I love or hate that
I have never seen [NAME] playing like this! (only started watching this season, not sure about last one)
i'm calling [NAME] noms with [NAME] [NAME]
Guys you can‚Äôt blame him. They didn‚Äôt have basic math when he was in school
Impeach ‚Äúfouty‚Äù five!!
See that's what I figured, but at the same time academy is such a hindrance üòÇ
I said in my original text post that I don‚Äôt think Venezuela is socialist, and I stand by that statement.
WAS THE A FUCKING QUESTION MARK ABOVE THAT GUYS HEAD? Time to git ur pitchfurks.
Thank you! I need to practice these things and change the dialogue within my head
I‚Äôm so sorry. <3

I just worked 6 hrs today and already hate it lol work just sucks. I'm not sure how other people do it.
Ugh the amount of mismanaged shame, the Olympic level gymnastics to deny deny deny....it makes my eye twitch. 
Ha, ha your mad!
Somewhere in Ohiooooooooo*
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen that many downvotes.
I‚Äôm just waiting.....
Sometimes those are the only options. Laughing makes other people feel better at least so that's what you gotta do.
[NAME] scoring when he wants. I'm loving his game. Unstoppable.
You're just mad because you're starting to realize that you're reaaaaaaaaaaally close to being a [NAME].
I dont watch battle rap. Do these guys come up with these on the spot, because that's amazing.
This one wishes he was still frozen in the refrigerator.
Yes he knew the child was his. I was living with him the entire time and we were constantly together.
I live in Northern Scandinavia now and one of the biggest culture shocks to my American brain was the groups of very young kids just roaming the neighborhood.

I can name a favorite verse in the bible, it‚Äôs that one yknow, the one with [NAME] and [NAME]!
I miss being little üò≠üò≠üò≠
[NAME] loves you. Be yourself and don‚Äôt let bigots stop you.
Well if you're in the plane I assume a boot in your ass to get you
Honestly, who can finish a venti frappuccino? Before it melts, anyways.
Let her contact you if she wants. Don‚Äôt bug her. Time to move onward and upward!
Prolonged eye contact.
Fatal accident on the 101 this
Lmao. Thank God [NAME] lost and [NAME] crushed the souls of these lunatics in 2016
THANK YOU!!! I‚Äôve been trying to figure out his name
I can scream HEH MOOMEN
In my opinion, there should have never been a canon character... Maybe keeping it a mystery would be the BEST!
He put up a 7 WAR season at age 22 I'm blind to that shit if he with us lmao
I was like you man, 3 felt so bad. But street part 4 3 becomes a so bad it's hilarious imo.
Having a friend helped me
He‚Äôs also talking about pushing [NAME] in front of a train. Kid needs the old bill coming around for a stern chat.
Probably alive. At the end of the video we see him getting up and he doesn't have any visible injuries.
That‚Äôs a very precious word from [NAME].
> when Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Did you just ask what's the point of posting a lazy and needlessly crass joke on Reddit? You must be new here.
Spiders in the corners of the house and praying mantis' on the curtains, best anti fly setup ever.
you might be suffering from delusions
Wow. Did not realize [NAME] was a top 20
"I'd go with ""Thanks"" and leave it there or maybe ask what exactly they are praying for depending on what kinda relationship it is."
That guy was beyond cringe, it was creepy
As a personal agent of entropy in this world: Damn, what laptop do you use?
Well I mean OP said this was a year ago, I meant that they could STILL press charges.
Ok her siblings. She lacks humility? No you are talking about [NAME] ever since she hatched dragons.
Thanks man, I feel better now.
Ohhhh my gahhhd. One of my all time favorites. Taxi Driver can take a seat. Brink is awesome.
Yeah, neither of them are communists. [NAME] is a left-leaning [NAME] and [NAME] is a [NAME]
Did I just get called [NAME]? Achievement Unlocked!
I'm not saying its in a good position im just saying just cause a guy enters free agency doesn't me they will only get scraps from teams.
Sigh. Maybe one day folks will see the system for what it is.
Yes. He‚Äôs a much better option than [NAME]
At least he isn't flying anymore.
I bid my condolences to any player who did not experience release day action. ‚Äú*Glorious battles, tooth and nail* *Noobs arrived, our matches grew stale*‚Äù
"Without even talking about diabetes, you really must be an asshole to celebrate overeating and call it ""progress"""
Not initially, however... 
>lol that's [NAME]
If it‚Äôs weed I‚Äôm going to be disappointed. Can‚Äôt we all just go to the store and get it?
I enjoy therapy...everyone's different I guess...I don't think there really is any other alternative....sexual abuse need professional help.
You'd think, but people are given a lot of leeway. Hell, in the South, public schools are allowed to spank children.
He's been great since his first snap as a [NAME]
This is just so beautiful, man! 
Depends on the state, generally speaking.
You can take those inserts and shove them where the sun doesn't shine. Begone anti-vaxxer.
We don‚Äôt improve without discovering our problems. Good on you man- wish you and your boyfriend many happinesses üôÇ
I hope you'll be feeling better soon, friend
Actually you're a [NAME] if you aren't for exterminating the 'wrong inherently evil and guilty race'.
What a perfect timing though.
I live in Shanghai and order directly from a plantation in Yunnan espresso roasts for home consumption. Absolutely fantastic.
So if the company announces they are recording the call, can I also record the call without telling them? Because they already know they're being recorded.
rule 0: dont submit a post if you can't be not stupid
I make all my coffee at home because I don't like wasting money unless it's free at the bank
He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.
Beautiful Work! You take doing [NAME] work quite literally:)
i love this subreddit
I didn't know that, thanks for the clarification.
Cadbury is better than both of these, however they‚Äôre still solid choices.
Withdrawal, psychic-shattering, and other activist groups, the principle is very sad.
Thank you for sharing, that was some very big-brained marginalia. Now remember to wash your penis and clean your room before you play minecraft
It isn't called the immortal science for no reason ey
No he was given a bad team to work with unfortunately, and never got the final shot he deserved :(
"It can get ridiculous ,too. She'll actually yell out ""stop yelling!!!"" when she's the only one yelling."
AND MY ~~AXE~~ MACE
Congrats keep going
12 years, that's it? Psh I've been dating my gf for 20 and engaged for 10 years
yuck, I'd be embarrassed to walk around with a black belt if I were actually blue-ish
Sure, okay.
Baseball?? Where‚Äôs my baseball??
Yeah if you‚Äôre able to fulfill that. Hopefully the bonus is worth it
Like [NAME]?
He is very affectionate in all other aspects. That‚Äôs why it bothers me so much, I think 
I was AF enlisted too hahaha
What are those things it's vomited out?!
As long as it‚Äôs all adults it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.
That‚Äôs gunna be a no from me dog
tl; dr you can just bore them to death.
Ah well the Devs change the cle all the time and this was knowledge from before new year. I forgot they changed it a while ago again.
You can cancel his single orb shot with melee too. Great for close range as discord headshot+melee is a shitload of damage.
Its not the best state But its better than most states.
He should file a civil rights complaint. This is a clear case of discrimination against someone with a mental disability.
‚Ä™Still haven‚Äôt lost 3 in a row, Still haven‚Äôt lost after leading after 2
Same old b.s.
Disgusting. Truly disgusting.
Love the almost sharingan look he gets in his eyes right before the attempt. O-O I CAN SEE!
Thanks ? Lol I'm no internet warrior but that crossed the line. I also DM the video to [NAME]. The girl deserves love
Ah got it. Sounds like most CW shows (Smallville)..thanks for the heads up :)
Double your fun with Double Mint
I‚Äôll read that, thanks!
Your welcome.
If the answer is No, the kid dies. If the answer is yes, the kid also dies
Holy shit. Thank you everyone. Thanks for the gold and silver :)
Oblivion's world was pretty generic [NAME] fantasy, which dropped it down a peg for me, compared with Morrowind's incredibly unique, alien world.
So creepy. Made me check my locks.
That, the fact that the photo was taken on someone's phone and the fact they couldn't be arsed to crop it properly...
I drive for a living so I have a pretty high-end camera that captures license plates!
"Or the action to take on the bad feeling. As we say in poker, ""he made a bad read, and got coolered."""
Yeah that's what I meant but I wrote it stupidly. Did you start with really low weight? Like really low?
[NAME] was far from an assassin. She had one amazing performance but that was it.
[NAME] GIVES BARRIERS NOT SHIELDS. LUCIO BARRIERS GIVE ULTS. HAMMOND BARRIERS DONT GIVE
[NAME] getting injured definitely didn‚Äôt help.Mou‚Äôs first Chelsea team was on a whole other level defensively
i'm curious where they would sell in CT? I have to imagine New Haven will have one. I cant imagine Fairfield County would get one.
Fuck the people that couldn't make rent, pay bills or medical costs because of the shutdown, right?
So much better that way!
I‚Äôm sorry to inform you, it‚Äôs worse. 
My name is [NAME]
Ah, thank you! I‚Äôve only seen them as decoration and on hotel doors. I had forgotten the name, thanks!!
Happy birthday! Aren't you a bit young for Reddit?
Pure unadulterated hatred. It‚Äôs disgusting.
Cleaning up my balls
They are. Primates (humans being the exception) dont hug like that when they're happy.
The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it
That's racist.
Maybe it depends on the state. In California, that means you‚Äôre a moderate [NAME].
I go ‚Äúthank you very much, come agaaain‚Äù. /s and I‚Äôm Indian
That's a shame. Well good luck
I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
Actually they will reveal that they never were friends in the first place.
I would not recommend contacting her. That would probably creep her out.
This is the worst take I have ever heard on cooking ever.
It would be a crime to not invite him.
Sorry this is the first time I saw it, I‚Äôll delete it.
It'd be easier not to do it at all. I don't think it's meant to be easy.
Hey, quick question how do you add tournament points to your Reddit flair?
Simultaneously terrible and awesome facial hair.
Apologies. My point still stands. A .8% lead is an insignificant majority at best. Saying one demograohic is most of the population is a bit misleading
They also had some kinda lemony dressing on the salad so the bottom of the sandwich was all soggy.
Yes. We actually just talked about it too. Dont know if he took me seriously, but am trying. 
And then you're stuck on that medication for life, sounds like a scary trade-off.
It's about fucking time, hope this is real.
And Arsenal fans hated him as he left them for his boyhood club, which made his great performances against them all the sweeter
Nah I think you're just feeling confident because you got a slamming deal on those clothes! I would feel the same way!
Who do you think can lead the Packers to where they need to be?
>Just be glad he didn‚Äôt kiss [NAME] mum. that'd make a good storyline tho tbh
Aww yesss assalamu ‚Äòalaykum akhi i love when i see a reflective post by you in here
"I would have used ""perplexing"" haha"
This isn't even cringe this is irony
You can't buy a toe line.
I wish [NAME] would debate [NAME], if he was alive :(. 
Looks like ketchup. üòÆ
Hilarious video, thank you for making us smile :)
Dude the speed which the cop came running is amazing
Are you kidding? Most of them think leaving the EU means we get our old Empire back!
beating up tire man
"""We should be happy that we moved from 4th to 5th"""
Who carries a spark plug on them
Seriously, it really made me happy! I hope when OP scrolled through she felt a little tingle of happiness too.
Oh how lovely and vague. Your non-committal form of conversation is delicious.
No that's called your sister is the milk man's/s
I want to taste their tears
this mom wants her child to die
Great mate good luck!
Ohhh sorry. I got it now. Thanks bruv
You lot are sick ! I tell you sick!! Lol
Oh ok I never watched that show. I love that judge though.
Gotten death threats and people compare me to flat earthers.
I was hoping to hear this. I'm up for it I think. I'll download it tomorrow.
I love taking my girlfriend to Victorias Secret, we shop together, and the whole experience is a kind of foreplay. I highly suggest that route.
You again.
Team Louis is a team, they fight all of us so we can protect our precious baby boy.
thank you very much, i do not care for it one bit
The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
Show them your hymen
Dashy gunless apathy arcitys scump
This is peak level of marketing inception. When people promote your movie by admiring your promotion of the movie.
My fave moments are checking cities and villages and my heart races when I see movement :D
Lol good talk
Also would like to point out to you that fighter is actually a synonym of soldier.
Are those potatoes on the bottom right...?
i feel like [NAME] doesn't fit with the rest
On PS4 it's very toxic. I would imagine it is the same over on Xbox One aswell
Only bet on games you like. Sometimes go a couple days without action. Betting just for the sake of staking something is never smart.
Nailed it !
I wish I could be this person.
Man. I can't wait until my life is so devoid of meaning I feel compelled to complain in a silly joke subreddit.
No. [NAME] can't do anything to me because he does not exist. He is just a chatacter in a book.
You cared enough to come on your alt to comment AGAIN. But you forgot to switch to the alt. Claiming you don't care is nothing special.
I love your username.
Honest mistake but I deserve and will accept the shame xxxx
Great write up, you‚Äôve sold me on Munchak being a good hire.
Well, you're shit outta luck then. All you can do is bear them feels.
"It's derived from ""being deadass serious."" As in dead serious. It's not a hard concept."
Boo for them, we're all yarn fans!
That's what I said! Except the bad person part but ya know what I mean.
[NAME], 2 weeks ago got charged $20 and was fake [NAME].
They were not really messing around, just more frustrated. They genuinely were trying to move specialists around to get the best out of people.
Thanks for the info, not gonna risk the ban. 
*Honorary Packer unlocked*
if [NAME] got a divorce he would stop doing this
Crippling? How so? It‚Äôs with Fox Sports right? I figured they probably had a good deal with them, but maybe not.
Wow, now I am sad
You're correct.
She looks late 30s. She‚Äôs gorgeous.
It's pretty clear if you understand basic math.
tbh i would've guiltied but atleast they didnt lose an important TP
The myth is about selling shirts. Signing [NAME] opens up much more money making opportunities like commercials.
Then why are you commenting on a thread about that article?
Good luck dude, it probably won‚Äôt be as bad as you think 
Not bad at all.
Nohomo but i'd come to daddy
This is good advice, and I apologize for freaking out. 
Fool you twice, shame on you
Am I the only one that likes the original better? It was cuter
Legit I just go to places and tell them to surprise me. That way I get to keep trying new types of food ü•ò
Haha came here to say this, that shit spun me out right proper it did!
Damn, time to tweet Young House Love and find out what color they used on the brick...
was that hutty from [NAME]?? ahhh that makes me so happy. love those boys e: oh it was a rebound
Hopefully [NAME] has a chance to get some decent Exotics as a free agent
Is it public? Are they aware of what's going on *all the time*? It's not as cut & dry as you think.
You don‚Äôt understand it because it‚Äôs insanely dumb, as the vid demonstrates.
Looks like a long lost cousin of [NAME]
Pant full of turd.
Use a damn rubber
Are the ones playing now ready ? If so they are very terrible. Rather we play the players that are not ready
"I'm curious about ""STERN? guy"" from the Phantom Menace review. I've never seen him in anything since."
Happy that you're happy, and good to see someone highlighting the good parts! Any particular streaming service you're looking to get? :D
This looks so cute! :D Her eyes came out great and I love her expression.
No, that means you're actually 41.
Interesting read, but horrible format on mobile.
One of the gayest shirts I have ever seen...
You‚Äôre not the police
Or ‚Äúbeta‚Äù
Lol Question for you. Why do you believe everything presented to you?
Time for a courageous conversation!
You know I‚Äôm sad the [NAME] hype is over because I actually think he‚Äôs been really good for us overall. I still trust him.
Meh, I still rock my Burns jersey with pride. 
Not really... I haven't lived anywhere where trains are common.
Yes I agree
That's fine. I'm searching for the truth, not just the legal truth. To each their own. 
I'd be surprised if mosques make the girls on school trips cover their hair, hence my question.
That's bad
[NAME] ONLY WANTS STUPID VERONICAS AND STACIES AND NOT US, GAYS RISE UP
You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can‚Äôt eat that.
Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
I'd say its higher tier stupidity because this belief actually harms people
FYI, it is still possible to play. You just need to do an advanced search.
Man I hate double standards. I love the show but change the word ‚Äòwhite‚Äô to ‚Äòblack‚Äô and it‚Äôs suddenly not funny anymore
Huge shout out to [NAME], wherever he might be, for always fighting the good fight!!!!
Yes that was abuse.
Usually it's not entertainment, it's mostly curiosity and fascination. Like when you see something horrible, but can't turn your eyes away.
Glad you‚Äôre doing better internet stranger, and I hope you continue to know peace and happiness. Be well.
Doesnt the bible have lovely passages about stoning hereticals as well? Moderate [NAME] are probably more common than you think.
Honest question that's all.
Just cooked me some chorizo and an omelette with tortillas at half time. The tortilla gods are now pleased.
> While less than 1% of DV accusations end up being unsubstantiated I find that incredible.
See there you go. Using the excuse to excuse the excuse.
The lads put in excellent shift over the Christmas fair dues lads. Thanks for keeping on top of things. Delighted online shopper :)
Neither am I. I'm mocking her alongside you.
This is not a good formation. We‚Äôve been over this. It just ends up being crossed lobbed into the box by [NAME]
Sorry I should have said army.
I joined DbD right after [NAME] release, but man I wish I had the splinters
[NAME] hitting himself with the other guys stick. Palms with another 2 goal night!
Fair enough. I miss working meat
Strange how it's funny until your mate's getting his arse handed to him.
This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
Reminds me of the Shell Gas Station Lego set my grandfather got me as a kid. 10/10 would build again
I love this trend.
We should sign him to a 4.5AAV contract now that he has already proved himself as an elite starter in the NHL.
Imagine getting woken up by it trying to beat down your door
depending on his age there might still be hope. brain development supposedly stops around age 25 so if he gets ample simulation and nutrients perhaps there can be hope
I didn't realize it's been posted that often! Good to know. It was new to me:)
Let's just see what [NAME] has to say about what really went down...
When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!
Basically how I discovered I‚Äôm bi‚Äî
I told him I left cause he couldn‚Äôt do this with me or for me
Sorry you are still being messaged by ugly guys, that must be really tough, you are brave for still using the site sweatie 
Ah yes, the merge from 640 to 40 by papermill. Idiots do this all the time. It really messes up the traffic pattern. 
Omg wow, this is great. Thank you so much!
The University of Essex was a mistake. They're not even good at sports.
Indiana resident here: fuck this state.

If my friend talked about my girl like he would be picking up his teeth. Support your gf. Period.
I friggin love the [NAME] hug!!!!
YOU KNOW THAT SET WAS W E T
No, he's told me on multiple occasions he hates anime
How does that get past the health department? Birds are filthy. Half cooked birds wing is disgusting.
The fun part is that she can be a bigot and he can also be a bigot.
They probably aren‚Äôt wrong. I‚Äôm sure many ppl diagnosed asd today used to get diagnosed agoraphobic borderline schizoid avoidant gad etc
Is that even legal? Isn‚Äôt that signing under false pretences?
Happiest bork.
Damn. I love peppermint.
Words of wisdom! Do spend that cash in upgrading your ability cards.

Everyone go home, the ~woke~ crowd have decreed misogyny and homophobia are a myth. 
Nah, this sub is for well put together unpopular opinions. This is too low effort.
These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
You dodged a bullet. She sounds like she's easily manipulated and they're nightmare in laws. Bad combo
isnt that halloween or like easter, man people are weird
Yesterday I remembered that this game existed and was happy that I waited and didn't buy into a game that would be dead in a month.
Show them to me when you draw them... if you want... Take care.
You know, I was wrong. I always assumed false dichotomy was their favorite fallacy when it's clearly strawman.
Lol. Unfortunately, yes. >sigh<
I feel like this should be a copypasta... It's correct and I want the message to be spread...Can we make this a thing lol
Well someone posted the ingredients in the comments below. I‚Äôm still new to the whole vegan thing.
[NAME] has consistently being volatile. It's just a matter of time until she's being rude to [NAME] again.
These aren't [NAME]... they're [NAME] that like to pose in the form of a hexagram for some reason
Her septum is crooked I'm hoping from the chain to her ear, but it's super irritating and I wanna snatch it out her face.
He‚Äôd definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose
Here we go again I hate [NAME] *becomes a Dodger* I mean I love [NAME]
I liked how in the video the [NAME] picked him up and held him a little. Pretty Wholesome¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I will always have faith in [NAME], he can be a factor even if his shot is not falling.
Shut up [NAME]
"You ""finally"" realized this? This sounds like a journal entry from 2003."
People will come for your body, stop putting that out there and you will see if they‚Äôre friends or not. See who stays for your personality
First and foremost you have to Love YOURSELF!!
But something is extremely wrong if people are getting sick. Might not be a sonic wave, but it definitely is *something*
Go check out the Secondary Bill of Rights It's a good start for unionizing
Damn Blake is on fire today
[NAME] is a comedian. Every monologue he does is based in humor -- extremely intelligent humor. He is also extremely observant.
Immigration is what keeps Canada alive, immigrants bring in money, work, entrepreneurship and raw number of people. Canada's growth rate by itself is not sustainable
I read a theory that somebody inside Huawei doesn't want [NAME] back. I mean that's the only explanation of hash response at this particular time.
I have had this same bug once as well. Idk what caused it, but it fixed itself next 
Agreed - from a team who made bowls at 6-6 twice in the past 5 years. We didn't deserve either of those.
Ps mad love seeing that the block has a baestok bighead
Honestly I‚Äôd believe it. [NAME] seems stuck in that high school mentality
Limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now [NAME] damn, they using a young baseline. Like 1951 or something. Were warmer than just 1 C
Love this!!!
You are all a bunch of losers. Nuclear weapons will accomplish this faster and more efficiently than any other means.
Could do even better by kicking out anything north of Cambridge or west of Oxford.
It‚Äôs beautiful. I think I need to move. üòä

Welcome to the future, kid. Unfortunately your mom isn't coming.
Damn, that's low. 
Willpower. I have a lot of little compulsions I give into. Time to gain control over my day to day.
Tell her boyfriend and send him the screenshots of her saying she‚Äôs having affairs for proof. Then cut this toxic person out of your life!
[NAME] you people are so fucking dumb
Fuck these calls
This franchise has been breaking my heart longer than you've been alive. Awesome.
I did hear that [NAME] is friends with [NAME], I think on the SC sub. This was probably like a month ago. Could be. 
[NAME] fan here, He did trade [NAME], it was for a 2018 4th and 2019 7th.
I never noticed this, how cool. I will keep an eye out for it! Another death foreshadowed by something small.
Ah the high life. Must be sweet.
I can tell you professionals didn‚Äôt do it that way in 2009.
Praise [NAME]. Hope his health issues have gotten better. Dude should be on a contender right now üò≠
The person next to you has a high chance of having candy or something cool packed in there so it would be nice to have variety
I was able to catch the first half and his D looked great (thats what she said?), did it decline in the second?
has skype installed
Is this [NAME] comics? His Simpsons stuff is great
I've tried a whole lot of things, nothing has worked.
My girlfriend hates it when I'm playing videogames, so there are definitely some women, especially from certain cultures that think video games are just for kids. 
Oh shut up. Quit being dramatic. Another option is... THEY COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.
PLANT LOCAL WILDFLOWERS!!!! They come back year after year and the Pollinators will Love it.

Thank you for sharing!
I dunno, I love me some barrel-aged spirits and ales.
Introversion is an actual personality trait though.
Well you find a love for glue, cat food and whoores you life is gonna go places. 
Theres a BIG difference between being against ones (hateful) political position and between harassing someone for his ethnicity.
Feels good bruh
I'm the opposite. I love spending time with friends but initiating it always gives me anxiety, so I generally wait for them to do something.
An eye for a *dead*eye? I'm sorry...
So sorry for your loss.
Just another way to consume the world's hot glue supply!!
I really hope we win tomorrow. .500 halfway through the season would be insanely satisfying... also I want to win lol
You‚Äôre so right. I‚Äôm just overthink it. But do you think it‚Äôs better in person or text?
Sometimes I just go on the YouTube video for any song older than like 20 years and these comments never disappoint
My favorite thing is when [NAME] gets the ball at the top of the key and every stands with their hands on their hips
That's gonna be a no from me, dawg.

Cries in Shinboner Spirit

Science damn you!
Took me a few time watching it to realize that was a man and not a child.
It‚Äôs a smart move but also hurts the business and possibly false. It‚Äôs rude.
I too have had this happen on XBONE. I really want to love this game, but it keeps giving me reasons to play something else.
Oh I wouldn't be surprised my dad got away with some shocking things despite cps investigation but he was also white.

I‚Äôve heard of ‚Äúover hard‚Äù so a fried egg (like over-easy) but broken yolk and fully cooking it... idk
Lol, no.
No irony. Liberals are brainwashed.
I also love the first sentence (but in a more pro-science way than was probably intended)
Wow, great news bro!
This is beautiful and accurate
The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!
It's the first two themes in the themes section lol - what game did you get :)
You're late, I'm not paying for those
As high as ~72% in black families. Truly heartbreaking what the expansion of the welfare state has done to the black family.

Is it you, Mr. [NAME]? 
Just appreciate the moment jeez
BONE-SHAKINGLY MEDIOCRE BROTHER
Hey, remember when [NAME] said furries are all catfuckers? Glad he's changed since then.
Besides the fact that they're alcohol bottles they're really quite pretty. Gives an antique perfume bottle look.
I just wanna say, I appreciate you making it into a gif. I wouldn't have watched the video. So thank you.
He is this year. Most likely not over the next three years.

This guy sports entertains.
He has a lot of patience. üòÜ
What a legend.
That can get me wet almost instantly. It‚Äôs ticklish but turns me on so much. It‚Äôs a really sensitive area I think.
Hell yeah if it were me I would be cheesing ear to ear!
Did you look at the picture that spurred this entire conversation, genius? 
This is not brain dead.
This article was written so poorly that it's hard to take seriously. It's like a stream of consciousness with very little to actually say
It's an interesting case study in scams
My favourite was ‚Äúfor people who don‚Äôt like water‚Äù. I don‚Äôt like their drinks but their advertising is always funny.

EA‚Äôs cancelled more Star Wars games than they‚Äôve made. They should lose their exclusive right to make Star Wars games
Yeesh, let her wallow then. You did the right thing in trying!
cause he constantly hates on [NAME] for no reason other than Petry having the puck on his stick more than anyone else on the team
I concur.
This seems like a very good write-up to me. I've been debating the issue a lot recently and haven't really come to a definite conclusion.
bahhhhh i didnt know this existed. i love/hate you. - [NAME]
Im on an SNRI, desvenlafexine, and it has honestly been life changing. I have zero side effects from it, whereas SSRIs made me worse 
I just can't get behind genocide. I hope you heal.
You are a treasure. Please know how wonderful you are. Big hugs to you.
You should have gone and joined her for a drink.... That‚Äôs my dream... Eventually sit down and enjoy a drink with my siblings.
Could this be more .jpeged
DUTCHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tried it. Failed it. Got mental consequences, my memory wont recover after half a year. You will regret it.
That thing is rather thin , it wouldn't be a big problem to tap-swallow it
I would like to do that but imagine how weird it would sound to them if they didn‚Äôt do it? üòÇ
You could see this as your friend caring for you, meaning well. 
"It's pretty stupid honestly. [NAME] clearly pointed a bug and people are saying ""oh, it's a feature"". ...seriously now."

Weird that a movie star is dating a hot young model?... like what‚Äôs weird about that
Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
I'm honestly shocked that the Bucks have more subs than us. I was surprised the Wolves had more too.
[NAME] I hope we get lucky again. Great job with the write up. I don‚Äôt follow college ball too much so this helps a ton.
Agreed. 52k isn‚Äôt a high paying job, it‚Äôs average. He probably is just irresponsible with his money. 
Wait is this a euphemism for ditching your husband and finding a new partner or did you lose 179 pounds?!?!
Convert to [RELIGION].
The ridiculous hypocrisy of the far left has nothing to do with your link.
Why couldn't we just carry our ending over to the next game?
When will this finish
This is like someone saw that scene in There‚Äôs Something About Mary where they wanted more foods to be cone-shaped and really kept it with them.
after months on months of making gameoverse, he‚Äôs had no time. it‚Äôs getting the best of him now... pray for him
True that.

You‚Äôre a women hating racist. That‚Äôs what you are. Stop talking shite and trying to pretend otherwise
I was sad when the Hawks lost [NAME] but this Schottenheimer guy seems pretty cool.
Trolling cat lovers used to be funny, 24 years ago.
No deagle nerf/vault, good patch but could be way better
Grats man. I hit my second live one today coincidentally! Feels good :)
NSW Police have always being great with the current memes. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it is a 15 year old running the page.
I had an anourism and got stage 4 terminal cancer from reading that so I reckon that means I need the tablet
I agree. Verbatim.
Pretty sure he stayed because he was told he's got the NE job once [NAME] is gone.
This picture is old af
I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.
Moose is pretty underwhelming tonight, I miss JV
im surprised you didnt try to go over her head to the owner or did he just not care about what the new GM was doing?
Except that was days ago. üôÑ

First thought that came to mind were those water benders in the swamp in Avatar: The Last Airbender.
FANTASTIC!! I didn't know what hole to look at. Geysers!
You‚Äôre probably recalling it correctly! It was maybe 2 years ago? Very ugly & sorted story
What kind of response is that it's so shit
You seem pretty upset about this. It's not an email it is a formal filing. It doesn't surprise me you don't understand that though.
that was clearly only one pump, bad call
So it's more of a power play than truly what she wants?
My shirt is [NAME]. My balloon popper is the DNC. And then [NAME] is the fire under my ass to dive deeper ever day.
Hallelujah!!!!!
Well the last sentence reallt hurts, but still I'll do my best to stay with her and keep her happy. I really love this girl
what a noob smh
Truely the man we needed but do we deserve? We let him down by not spreading truth far and wide.
The BMW had to pee really bad.
Windbreakers, we‚Äôre supposed to wear them when it‚Äôs cold as apparently a joke to keep us warm üôÉ I hate doing drive ups now
Obviously, as long as [NAME] commanded it then it's moral. Morality brought to you by stone age goat herders!

I‚Äôve always used a medium sized screwdriver but it can mess up the prongs so use a chopstick and you should be fine
Meh. Everyone's entitled to their opinions. I won't lose any sleep knowing they think my opinion is garbage. I am at peace with it.

To be fair, you have to have a staggeringly high IQ to understand the Dead Parrot Sketch.
Fuckkkkk I'm doing Psychology lmfao, am I gonna fail at life now? 
I would love you forever! Or dare I say, love you long time!
I think my family would leave TSCC if that happened they are so sexiest.
I don‚Äôt know what that means, please explain
Currently [NAME], I just finished watching season 1 and I really like her. Bendelacreme is my all time favorite tho
Indeed it does. I blame [NAME] and his love of sponsorships.
[NAME] has a nice text on this topic. Of flying cars and the declining rate of profit.
Damn you really love using name calling as a crutch don‚Äôt you?
I guess u were right since [NAME] just posted on ig the Dress made of tampons and pads lol
Surely anyone can submit an application for a writ of habeas corpus?
I was a huge fan of the script ones but the new greens this season look pretty fresh on ice, too. I like bringing the red back in
Your husband is a lucky man.
Got it, looks like they're in my vicinity. Will keep this on hand- much appreciated.
"Without Googling it? Are you kidding? (Please don't look up ""kidding"" in the dictionary.)"
She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place.
He can recker my pecker and make my pinkie all stinky.
This is like the third repost of this. But yes, very sad indeed.
Super righteous.

Why on earth would you have us over the Bucks.
Love the post bro. Gave me a lot of ideas.
I'm glad you liked it :D
Is she single?
Haha fair enough. Lucky you :P
Came here to say that. I'm genuinely astounded that it's as much as 12%.
Yeah, there are trees that are far older than 521 years.

Yeah that is definitely tough on the processor as it's running a software emulator and the game the whole time
Great, good to hear he was positive, so to speak, about it.
This is heartbreaking. She always meant well, and really wanted to see people get along. She deserved happiness.
In an alternate world our knees bend the opposite direction and [NAME] plays professional BASEket ball.
It's in my garage. Couldn't be any easier to access it.
What do you think? If you look at my question above? Last thing I should do is to say sorry?

Yo so friend canceled on me I got a free ticket today. PM me if you're interested!
Oh....yuck
I REALLY love martini glasses. But not this much.
Nothing wrong with a USL draft, if they play well in USL and develop further there's no reason an MLS couldn't sign them afterwards.
Just don‚Äôt feel bad. It‚Äôs their fault for taking it personally
Had to sober up before I could figure out YouTube, but that was amazing.

Thank [NAME] you used this prequel quote and not, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.‚Äù
Nothing in politicalhumor from them is even remotely funny. They're completely untethered.
Like at the time, he wasn't one of the best defenders in the league. But grew into one. 
Sorry to hear that
Maybe don't be friends with this person anymore...
Thanks, it‚Äôs funny how to me this seemed a leap but not one person agrees, lol
you dirty karma theft
It's not deep, it's a proverb. Actions speak louder than words. He's just paraphrasing something everyone is already told
Haha yes! Ill do that to my cat all the time. He seeems to appreciate the assist

Incredibly laborious task. They look like they're handling it pretty well though...
Yes no one wants to believe my religion and how to make people happy so it makes me sad
It's wonderful. Reminds us of the need for pragmatism and of course, just how much we've annoyed the [NAME] over the years.
I cringe at every part of all of this
I got matched with the best [NAME] in the world today, it was well fun. Felt happy to win a round ahaha.
That would increase [NAME] political power inside Turkey even more. Especially when he is getting weaker because of economic distress and refugee problem
Tbh, I think that sub was created because they got bodied here in arguments. 
Why are you making questionable jokes at work? Unless you work in a comedy club, it really aint the place.
Do NOT disrespect [NAME]. He is a beautiful, good man!. [NAME] is far from it and not near as pretty.
I dont like my rights being restricted on the grounds of race. That is the issue.
This must have been totally horrifying for you. I'm glad to hear you found peace in the second birth.
[NAME]. Snap me good baby.
This is art that I found via google

[NAME] everyone hated that map on lans we played.... but i loved it and forced it up their throat
I took swimming lessons for a while and my fingerprint thing didn't work for months
They look purple on my screen. But yes, tacky.
A backhanded and complicated way of saying you look androgynous.....so you're getting there :)
look at [NAME] over here.. of course it alone won't fix our financial problems lol
Is that max?
Ha, I thought it was about [NAME]. 
Having said that, if it was me there instead of you I probably wouldn't have come up with that until 20 minutes after the altercation was over.
I should've left after the first period ended. That was brutal.
@AOC for President 2028!
I just want to know how he got all that ice out of his bin
And then I got to meet the president. My name is [NAME] and this is my homo story.
Wow I guess alcoholics and drug addicts done exist either! and everyone always makes logical great decisions!!
Yikes. I feel sorry for the team that gives him anything above 5.5
Oh no now I'm caught in the suspense, what could have happened?
Oh I love flirtationships! This is normally us, but work takes us to a long distance relationship half of the year. 
[NAME] rolls with his kitties and is hard as fuck.
You started over at 46? Wow. You are badass. You give me hope that if I finally had to, I could do it.
depends on who im with lol. I became an Entp for a short while then went back to being an introvert.
It hurts because you hoped she would finally act like a loving mother and she didn't. She just gave you more abuse.
Some drown. Others look to the sky. I thought it was a blog.
I love that OP ‚Äúloved‚Äù his insult. It‚Äôs like the ultimate slap in the face to this CB.
I hope for your sake you don't include Frazzles in your ostracising.
And it‚Äôs super awkward with someone you barely know.
‚ÄúI am going to be going through a nasty divorce in a few years so I will need the money.‚Äù - [NAME]
Not at all!
MEEEEEEEEE. Most people don't get my humour, but every now and then somebody does and we non-stop laugh together. 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand... *BOOP*

It's bad enough to break into a house, but snooping and stealing from a friend?! r/trashy r/iamatotalpieceofshit Hope you have better luck with friends in the future!
This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work.
Yeah there's a lot of innately absurd conclusions this guy's drawing here
Good thing he throws like a 6 year old girl, otherwise this could've been serious. 
Ahh change.org, where change goes to...do nothing

Wow, are you me? No one is a fan of season 1 but I definitely do this. There are little gems despite [NAME].
Dude's brain is so huge his hat can't fit on his head.
It's not even the ads. It's the complete lack of anything worth watching between the ads.
"I love this; now when commies say they had the word ""libertarian"" first, we can say we had class analysis first!"
Can neins bring me up to date on what this is about?
What a great haircut
If he wants to play more, he should play better. Otherwise, leave. [NAME] has been very bad.
Now to get a new husband!
No but some random did afterwards. You‚Äôre welcome.
You said an untrue thing. Own up to it, asshole.
Dan cool and rich
Seriously! Such an odd way to ask a question about traveling.
Not even slightly.
This makes me feel so much better about the things I‚Äôve done that make me cringe.
For your is the First president to impose an audit on the DOD....... This Never happen.
Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines
Gotta love acid

Yes! My SO does that, unfortunately the requirements are stricter and I can't :(
I absolutely love DCfC!
You know what to do. Start telling people.
Eh? You inherited basically the entire language!
Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe
Betcha he just needed a new tube of that colour for his kit, & thought it'd be funny to mess with your heads. 
My boyfriend and I got haircuts yesterday and the coiffeuse thought my boyfriend was my father...
Pretend it's a multiplication table. Memorize a bit at a time.
That's more like [NAME]. Breakdance vs Capoeira.
Yes, very sad but that's the reality of competitive online gaming right now
Yeah it‚Äôs not a woooosh. Unless we‚Äôre all the wooooshes for thinking there‚Äôs not a wooooshable offense. This is wooooshpaganda.
This guy is in prison for meeting up with a 13 year old girl or whatnot btw
My parents are super progressive about who I date.
Luckily he is not.
I challenge all liberals reading this to find me one ounce of constitutional evidence that [NAME] should be impeached
Luv ya too buddy üòù
What's so special with 144hz?
This is the correct answer. I've seen more stupid memes about this show before I'd even seen it.
That's pretty funny imo
Okay, fair enough, though the vid worried me about the level of grinding in the game
I have one crazy as hell three year old boy.
Same. Sometimes when people ask me the number to something I sing this to them and only get confused looks :(
Yes? Whoever that is.
That depends on the country and the state (if in the US.) You don't even know what continent they're on.
is there any specific reason it can't be kept in Perth? the donations page doesn't give away much
Currently listening and loving it.
Respect from me for his acting abilities! Underused, to say the least.
Honey get me the napalm
Thanks for that. It seemed fishy, but it is what comes up when you Google it!
Legit. Can't beleive that society lets those people run around free like the walking sex crimes they are.
Hi [NAME]. Glad you are joining us and am looking forward to watching your episode. Did you do sleeve or rny? I am having rny in 2 weeks!
"[NAME] gets his attitude from his mother. The ""I'm so thoughtful and empathetic"" crap but won't do anything for anyone in distress."
Considering the role of hypergamy, men and women being on equal footing actually makes things harder for most men.
Thanks! Need to rewatch the series soon
When you live where it's this cold, incessant complaining is a national pass time.
Do your research = listen to anecdotal evidence from users(totally reliable!) and try it out, just be comfy!
That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.
Happy to help
I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
[NAME] was not aware that I had managed to diss the entire New Labour legacy in so few words but you read what you want to... hun?
It's the number it came from
Ask the murderers.
Should be nice to we can see full video clip how we died....
So the article is pretty much nonsense.
I blame framer, I'm sheriff I swear
Raw, unfiltered athleticism...whoops wrong player *puts down [NAME] player card* A real hard worker...could date the coach's daughter
why are you so angry
The whole post reeks of troll.
Thank you! I will take that warning under consideration. History is brutal but there's detail and unnecessary detail.
Today is just one of those all day long snack days. I will devour anything that is put in front of me
Watch Dortmund sign the better player in [NAME] to replace him...
Enjoying oneself automatically makes an action harmless?
Meant to post in r/Photoshop . There are more people online on r/Advice , though. Thanks for reminding me. Can you help me with my problem?
Grandmas knees are burning up
yeah, thanks
Griefing your oponents is amazing fun in a pvp game. *Cheating* to grief is the problem being addressed here.
Maybe it‚Äôs a cultural thing? That‚Äôs the way we do it in (I assume from my experience) Canada.
Wait until they find his bastard son, [NAME]. Birthed by his mistress, [NAME].
Amazing, I would also be deeply in love. So happy for you Hun. Enjoy every bitüíïüíï
Hellz yeah!
And according to [NAME] even Green Arrow couldn't defeat Cicada. Though wasn't that the non-butterflied-by-Nora-punching-the-satellite version of Cicada?
Okay I will, thanks so much you are helpful. I don‚Äôt even know if she is into me or anything but... I will see.

I didn't know that having the occupation of a journalist and the method of ones murder being beheading, gives ones death a special status. 
lmao I didn't realize that error.
Sir excuse me my mother says i am a very handsome young man.
Reminds me of that Australian news story about kids addicted to Fortnite and the kid is talking about how much he loves [NAME] ([NAME]).
This would make me sick.Getting cucked by bayern on and off the field.
It‚Äôs probably warmer in the freezer than it is outside. Oof
This length of hair looks so good on [NAME]. And [NAME] does have a glow...slow down on the booze and pasta ladies üôÉ
Haha good point

Long hair for guys should happen more, it looks cool *and feels nice too*
Damn I love 20 mins from Akron, but looks juicy. 
Truly a great man. May [NAME] SWT grant him the highest heaven - Jannat Al-Firdaus. Ameen.
Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.
[NAME] needs to be thorough when looking for clues. Who knows what kind of sneaky business might be hiding in that plant.
Is the misspelling on the cake the only thing you see wrong with this post?
A girl has grown up a lot since she was a 12 year old on the show, and she's grown up to be so beautiful as well.
Capitalism thrives where people are exploited more. Think about 19th century Britain (or America for that matter)
Very good fight. The red head above the M is hot and very distracting.
Anyone remember mean [NAME] burger and fries? That place was the jam!
I have to go with [NAME]. Rookie who lived up to the hype and I actually got excited when he got snaps.
NO GOD NOOOO!
Ya see I‚Äôm an engineer that means I solve practical problems.
I love this pic... believe me I am up for some reason my hands on you.
Oh no I didn‚Äôt see that episode!? She pooped in the car?!
You actually seem like an abusive alt yourself.
Stupid [NAME] is playing into the Church's hands. What an idiot. He has an amphetamine addiction.
That's slick, would love to see you guys do it.
It was a bad one, and you should feel bad. 
I'm glad you made a Reddit account to inform us how much you totes don't care bro
Would of been slightly awkward for someone to walk into my building haha
Ouch!!!!! That hurt me just watching.
Yes I am. Not sure other than to give me your best answer. Yes, walking in your moccasins is my goal. Thank you.
Wow did we marry the same guy. My STBX left the state for 3 months with no contact with his child.
Haha, nice try mom. *dabs*
Just wait. Wait for the false promise. Wait for the mandatory prompts. Wait for the empty gestures.
I think this isn't allowed on /r/cringe and I think that's why they hid that sub.
I heard a fade in/out version of palpatine‚Äôs screech in my head just now. Lol

FWIW I had a terrible series of experiences at CFA and would never recommend anyone with anxiety go there.
Yeah. Unless you live in a desert, ditch the scarcity mindset. It can keep you in relationships that aren't any good.
She‚Äôs like a younger freshener looking [NAME] though lol
Thanks [NAME] for winning so we don't have to see so much of [NAME] laughable career dwindling away.
Lead is probably 5-7 points, similar to 2018. The race was closer than expected, so there‚Äôs no reason to lose hope.
This is where the fun begins.
This hurts to hear because we know it's true. There are 16 year olds who have experienced more than me.
She looks really pretty
Do you need a safe space? Maybe a cold drink? Being easily offended doesn‚Äôt make you right.
The arch is so cool. I love St Louis
Here‚Äôs hoping!
What is your current relationship? From my experience women younger than 20 always look for older(0-3 years) men.
All the best things happen after midnight. All the worst things, too, but life is all about taking risks. :^)
I recently ate here and it changed my life. Get the steak sandwich with roasted peppers and goat cheese. You will not regret it.
I am confusion!
Including the fact that once I pirate something, i usually will purchase it later on either through frustration / poor quality/ actually loving the product / etc
Yea with [NAME] as a host right?
Welcome to the party pal!
Damn. I didn't realize they just aren't getting paid right now.
Oh and now vini is down

What‚Äôd he say?? I want to be in on his shame!
One of my worst nightmares. Ugh.
I was fine until I got to the ICU.
Goddamn right!
Yeah guys assume 95% of attractive girls are taken OR have a bunch of guys hitting on them online.
Ya! Nintendo is for kids! Now join me on my expensive PC and let's play stardew valley like MEN!!

Looks like Plastique stans will be our cringey stans of the season.
You don't understand what money is.
This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
After reading a lot of replies you should bee ashamed of yourself. This thread is a hive of bad puns and references.
well, they never said anything about curing her...
If you're cold and lonely, they're cold and lonely. Bring them in!!
If you're talking about drinking, unless there's tea or coffee in it, gross.

I enjoyed hardcore mode much, much more than regular mode in BF4. More realistic
I've had good luck reselling on StubHub. They take a cut but it is secure and easy to do.
Yup, I must be overreacting too and it's not a big deal. It's amazing the justifications used for this nonsense.
And this young man wishes to be an athlete. That sort of strenuous activity would not be possible.

Thank you, how epic is your curl? 
[NAME] has to be spinning in his grave right now
I have the Paraguard. It‚Äôs the Non-hormonal copper IUD and it‚Äôs good for 10 years once inserted
It‚Äôs common in business but it‚Äôs nice to see an organization have respect like that (unlike the Stars owner).
That explains quite a bit.

Sure, doesn't change it being overwrought nonsense though. 
Sometimes I wish he read mine
Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too.
But was he wrong though?
Love the headline though
"""bussy full of beans"" is an earth-shattering phrase"
He seems like the most genuine dude. I‚Äôm so happy to have him as our coach.
This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
I saw the video and liked it, but I should say: Man, you almost make me dizzy by moving your head that much. üòÄüòÄ
Just learn from this and move on bro. Give yourself time to mourn.
You're the best kind of person. I hope that you find great family and friends in your mother's family.
Obviously. Just like men are not raping or beating their wives. Rapists and wife beaters are. Thanks for playing.

I pray that you will have strenght to fight for yourself and go NC.
I'm jealous. I'm in California

Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital has these!!! Love it!

I feel like anytime a store accepts crypto is a way to get out of reporting income on taxes heh.
Let's see what [NAME] thought about it...
You are my beer god thank you haha
Hilariously wrong and uncontroversial.
I liked [NAME] too, but I'll take [NAME] over him 10 times out of 10.
I‚Äôd be interested in reading more about this if you have a good place for me to do so. Thanks.
Wait. Is this a parenting book with a typo? Because this seems to be a great approach to use with a toddler.
So, because its crypto business, they hold 1-2 weeks. Thanks for info 
Preach. The nuthuggers and happy go lucky blind sheep if the front office are nowhere to be found. So disappointed in this team.
> Then and only then might you receive ~~a tip~~ **whatever change we have leftover from our grand expenses.**‚Äù FTFY. Sadly.
His mom is indeed half black, [NAME] brother [NAME] confirmed it years ago in an interview. Doesn't fit the white supremacist narrative.
She has a good voice for a yoga teacher
Honestly if you had to live in punchbowl you‚Äôd be angry too
So..... it looks like dude is willing to break his own neck to help a vegan who is choking.
Did you maybe get Tag and Hide and Seek confused ?
[NAME] and [NAME] Funny thing is they both had a feud too and were in the ring at same time a lot
YES!!!!
Your actions mean your gf is still being bullied. Nice move
Please just give [NAME] some rest. He looks tired.
So. This is scary as fuck.
Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools
"Its actually ""[NAME]"" , not ""[NAME]"".. Sounds like a drunk to me. Glad to hear nothing horrible happened "
Honestly tho. Please stop posting this. We've been seeing this shit since at least 2003 and I was born in 02 ffs
I would be surprised if [NAME] doesn't let you in. I would write a letter to [NAME] and explain the situation they might make an exception.
Looks a little flaccid there
That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
Oh...this is the one time... Yes I can assure you none of those outlets print satire without labeling it as satire or opinion
She‚Äôs a rapist.
Can't fool me woman!

Dude I don‚Äôt even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him
This is fantastic!
It looks like it's from the Molecule Effect on Santa Fe. Great quirky spot!
This doesn‚Äôt sound very constructive so I‚Äôm going to move along but thanks for taking the time to respond.
And this is where it all crumbles - [NAME] was so keen on bringing [NAME] in on this and riled her all up - ugh
I know right! Lego really hurts!
Yes. Some things are simply not allowed.
[NAME] had talked about this entire operation is shady with an anti abortion agenda that's hidden behind their intentionally misleading name.
Scratch that, tickets go on sale February 7th.
Happy? Not really, but glad we can come to a conclusion to my offhand semi in jest reply.
For the sake of sexual contrast.
Takes r us...you literally make me want to overdose on drugs. Like you‚Äôre that insufferable.
This is hilarious
Wow that was really bad. But thanks for trying?
The baby photos, holy fucking shit there's so many baby photos now.

You cannot have your car running while you're pumping gas.
Damn bro thats wack. But life has a way to with things she'll reap what she sows. Feel better
You still worrying about that is like a poor person hitting the lottery and still worrying about money. You hit the jackpot bro.

He has the maturity of a 2 year old and you are right...ugly in his soul.
Oh look, it's wr2! *proceeds to get fucked*
It's not unheard of but there are certainly candidates ([NAME]?) who aren't quite to her level on guns.
She's a piece of work. I'm glad you're reporting your account issues.
I am really sorry that you are feeling this way. Sending you good vibes and reminding you that you are beautiful.
u/RedOnTheRail you slime!
Nope, they still left even though they knew I was going through a rough patch :)
Or, drag an old pallet jack outside, empty. 
Work along with More like fill out an application form!
[NAME] made that lmao
Just a minute... I‚Äôm late for GOLF!!
Just like he couldn‚Äôt call his executive producer [NAME] to ask if [NAME] had met [NAME] in TFA.
This is my best bro being a dumbass....he said he was ok though.
The orange man angers me and I do not like him.
How do you hire the former DA? That sounds super helpful...
The recycling bin would be too full, theyd end up chucking cans and bottles into the regular bin.
I‚Äôm so jealous
So...... SOOOOOOOOOO glad Atlanta came back and beat the Bucs. Because of it, my beloved [NAME] are coming to Tampa.
Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished, restore it!
Yes please. Take the cheeto too, fuck it.
I do! (Sorry this comment just showed up for some reason)

OP already stole it himself
DonutLicious in Spring is the most gourmet one I‚Äôve ever been to.

Wow that‚Äôs one way to get out of it for a while ü§î
Here is their other hot wallet: the story behind
I'm curious, what words were used? I cannot for the life of me conjure up the Hindi sentence for this in my brain
So happy for you, enjoy 
The article says an emergency declaration let's them skip some regulations on contractors... Overpriced no bid contacts to his cronies are on the menu, boys!
I have that one! I like it a lot. Despite the name üòÇ
My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that
[NAME] you like picking and choosing. not how life works. not how fact works.
Like [NAME] [NAME] yes but [NAME] [NAME] is super nasty. Whoever wrote the dialogue for classified needs to be fired cause it‚Äôs makes me wince
Maybe she did know but loved you more for it.
Dark and funny, but not really nice guy. He has yet to call the dead girls whores for declining to sleep with him. 
Aren't they designed to not go straight if you don't hold the wheel? Something about making sure they don't go too far?
It's a lame, timid city on a beautiful harbour.
I get to walk home for 30 minutes for the next 3 days. Pray for me everyone.
I used to work in Xtravision and I remember watching one called Cherrybomb - the fella from misfits is in it, as is [NAME]
Is ketaconazole scheduled?
Detective from svu.
I would have to imagine this girl has just been training super hard for the past few weeks.
[NAME] will be great. But I will definately miss if she's not there.
"he said the victims who survivied ""pushed a fat person in front of the shooter"" yeah that really 'making fun of bad ideas' "
I get that. That's why thet time limit. Even if it's just to reevaluate.
1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue
these [NAME] impersonators are getting terrible
They do not need to. A majority of the vox populi think like you do.
Drink the kool-aid! Lol
She had a reality show that actually showed her in the act doing horrible stuff
"Reminds me of ""This Be The Verse"", haha."
It was definitely [NAME] goal. The stadium announcer incorrectly gave it to [NAME] though.
Because people want to have more than the absolute bare necessities for survival.
Clearly he did at this point. He wasn't some serial killer cannibal.
Super creepy. And leaving the note is out of line
Eh, same difference 
[NAME] is near the same age..
Breaking bad all over again
I hated doing group work. Unless groups were assigned I always went by myself.
Honestly at this point they need to do that or adjust [NAME] 3d model. The command grabs literally go thru opponents constantly, it looks weird as hell
Darn it. I was saving all the food stuff.
Post on the [NAME] and listen to info wars, you shouldn‚Äôt have an opinion on the Internet and you should not share it
Which subcommittee?
Timestamp it for me then, apparently I didn't listen when Mom said that would make me go blind. 
That‚Äôs a lot of emotion for a queen who deserved to go home
"""joke's on you, I was only pretending"""
That's totally my focus for today, just enjoy the day and being there for myself :) it's so liberating.
[NAME]!
That must hurt
I'm in the opposite boat. Just make the nausea stop pls thx.
I like [NAME] so far but making shots that you missed in the first half aren't coaching adjustments

Turn undead is once per short rest, you can‚Äôt make use of it frequently, no wonder the dm was frustrated
This conspiracy theory that entertainment scandals break as distractions makes more sense to me every year
My school did this too except with a gold spray-painted plunger. Kids love toilet humor. üòé
... They're stockpiling guns because they're afraid of blog writers?
An indie rock guy I loved used dialectics to explain his songwriting process, it was weird.
And what a fuckton of karma it was. It‚Äôs fake stories like this that really prove that communism is the far superior economic system.
By all means, tell me what I said that was incorrect. 
Horrible waste of time.
Thank you TC for getting us to 100!
Are you an ENTP? That sounds like a pretty ENFP motivation to me. You don't have a flair, so just curious.
Thank you, I hope so too!
Fuck I love you prag
Haven‚Äôt watched much of his other stuff but I loved his debunking of [NAME].
I‚Äôm not sure that asking one person about her opinion on tipping in a country that doesn‚Äôt widely employ tipping is solid research.
Alright OP here, I'm an [NAME] and this is not even close to how coupons work here. Didn't realise you [NAME] had such extreme coupons
Just like the [NAME]. But nobody complaining about that.

our enemy, the state 
This pleases me.
Well, I bought cheese when I went, and was shocked at the great variety and lower prices. That probably skewed my view.
Ahh okay, that makes a lot of sense. But you're totally right, we've just gotta work as hard as possible.
Yeah, but you should drive to the road conditions not the speed limit.
Eat her out
There are courts. You need to document all this and let the judge give him a tongue lashing. Not that that would make a difference...
I think this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen this joke.
I have but I sugar discreetly and I‚Äôm genuinely afraid to have that compromised due to the field I‚Äôm in
Wow, really? I hope this kind of event doesn‚Äôt happen that often.

We made a big raft of inflatables on Little Bay and listened to the Hottest 100. Good times. The water is finally nice and warm.
Can't imagine voluntarily looking through those photos.
We don't know anything yet till it happens. It's great to see everything think they know the eliminations order.....lol. you will be shooked
She looks like that in every photo
Hello to fellow blue haired people!
Don't tease me with [NAME].
She's already promised her kids they can have it and now all four of them are crying!
When is this from? If it‚Äôs after [NAME] clothing line and yeezys took off then that was a p dumb question the reporter asked.
Good point, I never thought about that. I guess I don't see enough commercials regularly to separate them from just other company agenda videos. Thanks!
Insurance and healthcare have the same attitude. Keep people alive as long as possible, but keep the people dependent on the system.
will watch the films, thanks for the recommendation 
yeah because 10 days ago [NAME] was still playing dumbass
Did you seriously miss the like 50 comments above that girls can‚Äôt play games?

[NAME] is just awesome. I have vacancies for long range adoptive grannies if she's not busy?

Who cares, you‚Äôre just showing what a racist pos you are. Carry on doing our work for us.
You have a real axe to grind about this. Should've pulled your bootstraps up more and mowed more lawns in the summer, son.
Sometimes you just have to laugh.
That‚Äôs sex discrimination. The male class has their own bathrooms but the female does not.
Oh I hate him even more now.
> [NAME] My god we have to stop with some of these advanced statistics, it‚Äôs legit getting ridiculous. 
That‚Äôs very admirable and courageous of her. I appreciate the many women that are doing that here on Reddit as well.
Lethargy and depression both make me personally expect to not go through that later in life dilemma but kudos for finding the cure.
Zoos are the reason why many endangered species are no longer endangered. You oppose the existence of zoos. Therefore you would rather see those animals go extinct.

Makes me want to break out my 'learn to use my SLR properly' resolution again.. more time commitment tbh. Great shot.

I agree with you. [NAME] would be awesome here.
If you're blaming her for the design of the movies I'd say it does matter since she didn't do them, but ok. 
">player consistently plays like shit ""Durr hurr here come da hate train"""
she‚Äôs dropping a winter project it could be that but who knows
This wasn't him forcing her to get an abortion or breast implants dude like seriously you are being pretty ridiculous.
I actually find it easier to place spawn beacons in stupid spots like this than a nice flat empty piece of ground.
Her communications director his now working for [NAME]. Get ready for some more cringe
I second this
I‚Äôm not sure but I assume each season has at least some form of special features.
Is a really worrying bench
You have friends that reddit? What a peculiar notion.
I'd say the pecans is the biggest mistake
My girlfriend's creepy uncle gets extremely triggered when I point this out, or that a lot of conservatives are gigantic fudds.
I think it'd probably look darker, but I was mostly on about flavour. You'd definitely tell the difference in flavour.

Thats awful and Im sorry for your friend. I whole heartedly agree. Its getting out of hand.
Depends, do you become so old and senile that you have dementia can‚Äôt walk and shit
I mean maybe I did too but as you said it was a decade ago or more.
This is so tough for all of you! I'm so sorry!. Are you in Canada? I would push hard for a pediatric gastroenterologist.

Not necessarily. Poor people tend to purchase cheaper foods, and have assistance programs that others don't have access to. 
Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he‚Äôs only now feeling the consequences of his actions
I've never heard the insult 'Galaxy-Brain' before, but it's a wonderful! I'm gonna have to use it more often.
Good answer. Thanks for taking the time.
Isn't that why [NAME] is playing him?
Why tarnish The Office this way?
Definitely not Fox News though! That‚Äôs the real stuff, zero lies or bias there!
Aaaaand now I'm concerned. Clearly there's a story behind this.
Seems more first thought is to stop and make sure to call 911.
Thanks for this!
How do you think this would have went if those two switched roles? Probably not as smooth huh

I always flew out from Edinburgh. First time flying out from Glasgow and I was shocked at how small and... dingy it felt in comparison.
No, you are saying that.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with what he said about an hour ago. Unicorns. He just ruled out any sort of

Also, the Detroit Police Underwater Recovery Team is a thing that I want to learn more about...
I guess there's this, but that's all I can think of.
As a CPA the part about the tax deduction triggers me more than your cousin trying to sell things to you.
The SATs are taken on weekends, it's a standardized test that's used for university applications and not a regular school thing.
This is so damn cute, I love it!
Thanks GM & Ford!
Oh I didn't even know there was a web novel
Meh, same branch of religion. Just opposing views on the sequel to the story.
She regrets getting in trouble
This is not fun
This team was nowhere near legendary, filled with legends sure, but incredibly disappointing.
I know what you mean and with me, I love animals. Do you have any hobbies you like to do? 
WHO'S EVEN ON THE ROSTER AGAIN? FUCK, [NAME]? [NAME]?
Because [NAME] did not create us as apes and yes Science can never disprove [RELIGION].
What is that
nice one! but it‚Äòs a much more underground one I think
By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet
He forgot about his head real quick after his legs got smashed
Damn that's huge
Loved that shithole base! (not being sarcastic)
Yawn. They‚Äôre toxic together and their only trait seemed to be getting naked together.
Not a fan of Hot Space. I like one song on there and that's Under Pressure.
Look at that shit-eating grin
Imagine being this petty.
I hate when MoonWolf1-799 is taken.
If I say 6:45 they tell me at 8:00 that they‚Äôre not coming :(
wow. I think you've done all you can.
"""Don't eat pork! Not even with a fork!"""
Horribly fake. People on that thread are stupid and gullible.
I really love that game devs are started to put these references in games.
I have never laugh cried so hard at a TV moment
[NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] just yelling over each other and [NAME] looking around like what the...?

She births the antichrist and has to fend of the demons trying to abduct her baby
lolt wut i have no clue but that sounds like something that would happen in germany
You look so happy now üòç Hope you are doing well and that you get everything good you deserve. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I like how u/FThumb is pissed that this got linked like the bros don‚Äôt ever brigade other subs
Lol all those people that disliked have probably never even done shrooms before
I love the sense of humor on this sub. It gets me.
They aren‚Äôt really being choosy.
Ya did good, kid. 
Nice picture, hope we keep him!
I really like him goat and [NAME] on the 4th line. They've been real solid. Absolute beauty of a first goal. Congrats, trevor.
Lolz yeah you got me for sure. That's another huge reason.
I, too, have experienced weight gain despite eating a clean 500 calories per day (and another 3000 dirty calories on top of that).
"Probably should have stopped popping the heads of dandelions while saying ""mama had a baby and the head popped off"" "
Ur right. It was a loose comparrison.. I hope i got my point across at least.
When he shoved them.
I've never been so bored with so much money on the line. I am numb now.
You beat me to it
Why is [NAME] still getting minutes? He is probably the worst player on this roster.
I love you. I think that helps me a lot.
I'm so sorry you were bullied in a place you should have felt safe.
The like is the worst of the bunch
extra time goal that keeps us on the run to win the caneco !
I think OD needs a rework. Get rid of that crappy 50% passive and give him some sort of active or a proper passive ability.
Nice rifle. I have a T3 in 7mm rem mag. N Mine would suck as a SHTF rifle, but it's great for hunting.
Do you think the nude selfies story that came out a few weeks ago was about [NAME]? I do.
Honestly, the fact that they're over and done didn't truly hit me until I saw that they now have a Greatest Hits album.
From an Instagram post about the judge critiquing [NAME] look
I already told you, food poisoning or allergic foods. The real greedy snake oil salesmen are big pharma.
It feels like it plays worse tbh
[NAME] these things were terrible. i presume they still are. #teamlemoncreams
Is that [NAME]?
Nice! I‚Äôm glad you liked it. Have fun exploring :)
I've never seen [NAME] dad look this relaxed ever. :D
Yeah that's how someone died at Dour festival when swimming in the stone quarry :/
The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.
Moral and factual truths are equivalent. If you purposely make a wrong decision based on false beliefs or incorrect theories then you're immoral.
Wish I was this happy
Who said that
So much lost diversity...
Is everybody forgetting that bills need to be signed by the president to become law, or get 2/3rds support in both chambers if not?
nice one gards!!
I‚Äôm scared to fall asleep‚Äî‚Äî-
Yeah I know day of the dead is real thing but they way [NAME] portrayed it was so much better than anything I've seen
Good to know the obsessive thinking is because of them... I‚Äôve felt like it was just me ha. Thank you üôè
I didn‚Äôt say for how long I‚Äôd been in it. :) Maybe it was made of ply board and garbage!

1 month feels like 200 years? School must suck
I already know [NAME] sucks... He will be gone in 2 years but the shitty press that you support being like [NAME] will still be here. Congrats on supporting propaganda

Feeling this so hard right now. Virtual hug.
In case anyone missed this masterpiece of cinema
As a non-religious that‚Äôs fascinated by [RELIGION], I love this üòÖ.
Arguing a player is the GOAT among every position is just a dumb argument to even begin with when it comes to football.
There is so much positive support and affirmation in this thread and I love it. Congratulations OP.
I can only imagine what we call it when you have sex, then.

It's piss but its [NAME] piss so you make your move.
Teen should report him for abuse.
Haha it could be! As much as I love supporting small, local grocers they tend to inflate the price on specialty products. 
That tiny shoulder pad is freaking adorable.
I don't think either of them is a bad director. They are both bad writers, though.
That's still a fucking insane number. 70% is goddamn insanity, and the only reason you're alright with it is because you're unaffected.
Thank you, it's pretty helpful.
Its the only one...
Oh good point! I bet the farthest they go is reporting to credit agencies. Which still sucks but he can always fight that outside of court.
No. We all begin in ignorance.
Tired of watching [NAME] choke, hope she's better in the deciding doubles 
Perfect! Put it in a form they can understand!
This comment is fucking cringey lol why the fuck do you talk like that
the original concern was about one particular type of vaccine, not all vaccinations.
Art degrees are useless! Now excuse me while I go watch a Pixar movie. /s

That's just damn creepy.
Yikes. That be a manipulator red flag. They tell you their darkest up front to test how nonexistent your boundaries are to see if they can go ape shit later. NEXT.
[NAME] has been really blunt about things lately, I love it.
Just watched The Pass on Netflix--really great movie, but not exactly a feel-good time...

These kids need to not be on this forum 16 is way too young to feel like that tell your mom to pay for a therapist or something
I completely understand why some people would want to report this, I just said that I wouldn‚Äôt. You do what you think is right.
Oh haha I‚Äôm from liberal MA and started having sex younger. I come from a sex positive environment.
So THATS why the sheep followed that pig in that Babe movie...
I liked the slug :(
A Reddit couple! That's good to hear, hope yous stay safe :)

I think you need a better partner. Continuing to go after you said you want to stop is kind of abusive.
She can also say she's committed to the public system while still wanting two tier. So what she said there truly means nothing.
You are one weird individual.

üò≠üò≠ okay. You‚Äôre right! I should just like make ice cream at home and get over it.
The worst part is the character in the image behind it is great and this just hurts to read in his voice.
Where do you see that? There's a big red spot on the left side, not the right side.
The old bait and switch.
Haaaaa this was just on OZ the other night. Thanks.
Well how‚Äôd the planters pull this off? Step by step.

I'm glad you like doing - you can feel the darkness taking over haha. This honestly sounds like an animated short?
With the Mets, I expect the worst 24/7/365.
The irony here is i agree, but [NAME] is capable of doing it in a bad tank meta. That guy really needs a look at, lol.
Serenity and love and loving serenity.
Gonna warn you, that path is a lot more dangerous than you would think...
I wouldn't even call this a CB, she wasn't offered anything and turned it down. Still sad, though. 
Absolutely terrible. But wholesome aswell.
Hmm I wonder why the bot copy text LAOP says is in NY when the original post says LAOP says he's in TX
Oh I see. Thanks for letting me know. I fixed it now. The real link is HERE
New Haven has tons of locations that have strong cyber punk-y vibes at night!
Ahhh, my bad. I thought they were blood related.
Yup, that sounds more like it. I think those five superhot women who legitimately never get hit on are shut-ins or extreme introverts.
Lol, crazy move of the goalpost but okay
The problem is that people cannot differentiate between a necessary and a sufficient condition.
You're trying to come off smart, but failed. 
I highly doubt they will do another multiclass character after what [NAME] did to the game.
I love how she literally held [NAME] back, a few times. They‚Äôre adorable. 
The Melo FA is why I got a Twitter account I was an F5 machine that summer.

I mean, if BDN wins another SB MVP . . . you can't exactly get rid of a guy like that
Yeah I think you understood my issue then
I kinda like the swirlies in the hair. But then I saw that her eyebrow is actually just the hair and hated it.
I mean, if A video pops up of [NAME] pissing on underage girls, nah, I‚Äôm not gonna still be a fan. 
As a [NAME], this very relatable
You‚Äôre ignorance would be excusable if you weren‚Äôt so douchey about it.
Which means it isnt his fault? And the 4th? What the fuck was he supposed to do. stop blaming 1 player.

Cause silly [NAME] is working out.
Anecdotally, I have severe hypothyroidism and it hasn't significantly affected my weight loss. The key for me was tackling the synthroid dose first.
No worries. Have a nice day.

Don't stress it. Good Luck!
I‚Äôm gay, so let‚Äôs hope this works! I look better clean shaven lmao. Thanks! 
It most likely isn‚Äôt foreshadowing. [NAME] sings, and the song has [NAME] name in it.
This genuinely made me angry. He and his sociopath of a wife deserve each other.
Omg the face

Yeah, 16 yearolds being attracted to other 16 yearolds sure is creepy... 
That‚Äôs actually a great idea. I didn‚Äôt even think of that.
You are entitled to live your life the way you want to. I never said you weren't. You really are just disappointing.

Time to let the justice system run its course.
Yay, I hope so! I'm feeling good about this decade.
I‚Äôve reported her before I think that‚Äôs why she stopped pming me and started following my comment history instead.

We need another goal to show for it. Come on boys.

She's used an app on her waist, you can tell from the pixelation in her hand and from looking at her you tube
I‚Äôm sorry where is that?

Yes, all the time when I can tell somebody is upset with me. Allistic peeps really refuse to communicate clearly it‚Äôs the worst!
I have never seen [NAME]?
*Rosa..Rosa..Rooosaa, Yeah! Beautiful Rosaa*
Bullying impacts brain
I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer

Recently got this book! I would be interested as well!
What are these other non stick options?
Ugh...terrible.
What a little nugget!
This is awesome. Always been wanting more historically accurate representations of ancient Chinese military equipment and soldiers and not the almost fantasy level stuff seen in drama's.
wouldn't you say [NAME] and [NAME] are part of the same generation?
It‚Äôs not even news.
I just hope you are all right dude
Lol I know, right? It's unsettling how bloodthirsty some people are. 
The mom looks like my great aunt when she was younger.
Can't wait for it.

Keep your head straight, stay on your path, and stick to your guns. 
No problem here. Bio hardly ever matches the personality
Haha, actually grandpa did! Go figure 
Thank you for phrasing it in a way where I picture [NAME] leaning over a school bus seat to tell me that.
CW is available without Cable. But if your saying it doesn‚Äôt qualify as broadcast then I guess Kids WB never did
Lol, no one can say that because you don‚Äôt know who the fucking shooter is. What‚Äôs going through your head?!
Demeaning women is the same as mocking the clown president? Cool.
When I was maybe 8 I discovered that I liked hot dog buns with just ketchup. I shortly discovered what heartburn was.

Then she is just passing her bad habits forward.
Maybe he has really bad short term memory, and is genuinely curious how the cop got his attention.
He also could have warged into several different people and told [NAME] that [NAME] didn't kidnap and rape [NAME].
i.e. the 13th, 14th, 15th of the [RELIGION] month

One thing I appreciate about the Prequel trilogy is that it explores the rise of fascism better than *Fantastic Beasts* movies could do.

Not cheating and not using exploits is honorable. Other opinions are not relevant imo.

Most of them I know quit and went to work elsewhere. 10 years and out here.
Thanks dude! I do best with the ice, swat and maddox
That's what is so stupid about this. My dog gets dreads on its ass sometimes when it poops. Is that appropriation?
I mean, if it‚Äôs rotten food, especially fruit, mixed with various meats and maybe some seafood- you can get a pretty mean stench going. 
This isn't about football, [NAME] is a horrible dude.
Why‚Äôs he pointless? I want to know how people like you watch this game. Genuinely baffles me.

When I went on a first date I only took like 2 bite of my food. Felt pretty bad
When a dog brinks you it's toy, that's the sweetest thing it can do :)
[NAME] might actually be able to pick her up and carry her without huffing and puffing now? üò≥üòì
r/patrig Edit: looks like someone already cross posted it there. That was fast.
you're talking about [NAME] like your a child and your dad said something that you don't have the ability to apply with nuance.

Or use hot glue to stick the bristles together into one big lump! ROTFL!
Ah alright, thanks for clearing that up.
Thank you mods for the sticky. This is such an important story. To my surprise, the NY Times had a brief piece about it.
[NAME] is an embarrassment to this state
I think he actually isn't feeling well tonight. He left practice early yesterday because he felt light headed, [NAME] still put him in.
That dad must love monster high as well.
So this dude gets a bonus that could have funded HGC for at least 2 more years. Thanks Activision!

Reminds me of that Black Mirror episode where the lady is brainwashed after committing a crime and forced to repeat the same government-made story with mind controlling phones forever
theirs a diffrence between interaction and literally forcing someone off the stage. The fact that you cant tell the difference shows how desperate you are

I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged 
"For a second there I read the subreddit as ""furry and sad"". Pretty disappointed."
It took me way too long to realize that was a claw and not just a smashy thing.
Then people clapped
There is no Mrs [NAME]. Unless you count his sister.
Anything yet?
How early is everyone leaving tomorrow?
I was a [NAME] fan for a good bit, so that swayed me a little towards his teams
No Rand Paul, so it‚Äôs far from a complete list.

Bags are packed. Have to leave the country at a minimum as it's one of those gyms that's all over the place. Bad times.
I have pretty bad anxiety and have recently adopted two kittens. I definitely feel less anxious when I'm around them as they are such sweet animals.
Anyone can edit those pages, so I wouldn't get too excited by that yet (but I hope it's true).
[NAME], we told you to PLEASE be sober when you come to work!
Ah brilliant, thanks for sharing that. It does indeed look promising. Shame no mention of Lethals possibly but oh well =]

I missed you [NAME] you're pretty cool
Misogynist! Anti-women! Bigot!
That's not an actual thing you realise? No one is that stupid.
Also assumes a kid only has one teacher K-12 at school. Which is ridiculous.
Intolerance of what? You keep using these buzzwords but don‚Äôt seem to have a clue about what they mean.
I feel personally attacked on this one. We're good people... : (
Wondered 'why doesn't it seem like theyre making any progress' before I realized how short the loop was....
Anybody think maybe we‚Äôre the mystery team in on [NAME]? At this point I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
I was hoping [NAME] would get into commentating.
Fucking hell...
IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ME, I HOPE DO NOT PASS THE SAME AS WITH THE OTHER GIRL ... üò≥
reminds me of Far Cry 5
If you want nuance, deep thought and constructive dialogue maybe try a topic not as asinine as the cultural value of a reality TV star üòÇ

I'd make that trade and I don't even like big macs.

You‚Äôre attacking me and need to stop
Surprised, Playtest isn't mentioned. The ending is just god damn!
Advocating for rape and torture of women on a whole and even inciting men to do it seems like it should break the rules.
You're not [NAME] about your joke, good pun there mate
They're wrong I don't like math and I'm still ugly

WE ARE WINNING THIS GAME
Considering the fact that I don't consider jealousy or envy useful, you are dead wrong. It might be other people but not me.
Wow what a disappointing game. Wish we would have showed up
Happy New Year Everybody!
And is that good or bad?
I honestly can't tell if your being sarcastic or not with this comment.
How dare you make an attempt to be kind!
Not happy.

The title is a lie. I dislike what the APA is doing as much as anyone else, but how bout we dont sensationalize it.
That works for me, I am not hell bent on killing this person.
and is where it's at!
Toxic feminism is ti blame
Faze might tbh
Just curious, why would that matter? Acting is playing a role, so how is it important that the character and the actor match orientations?

bournemouth v chelsea took under 3.5 3-0 then in the 95th minute bournemouth grab another. feels bad man

YAAAS! Even though you're a stranger on the internet, this has made my day.
As a PPD mommy myself, you're my [NAME]! Thanks for this... Thank you for reminding me how amazing us mommies truly are!!
Places such as? Is [NAME] proposing we simply upgrade already existing barriers or build new barriers. And if the latter, where specifically?

Thank you, and same to you. I was a single AP once, it was lonely. Do you see other people?
Ladies and gentlemen
I still trust him. I don‚Äôt think old school republicans as stupid enough to break the law for [NAME]. Hence they keep getting fired.
His work schedule is pretty consistent so I should be able to move out when he's at work. Thanks for your advice.
Why do you keep failing? Is there a particular part you can practice on, or just nerves?
A few coworkers think [NAME] will mount a challenge with fairly high effort on his part. No one thinks it will succeed as long as there's no massive events.
Cespedes is likely not coming back this year

I'm sorry that happened to you. You planned a awesome day that I wouldve loved celebrating with you. Happy Birthday
That sounds like a hot date. ;) I've never been, but friends say just order the cheapest food and enjoy the ambiance.

Good. It's weird that Polish gun culture is nearly non-existent, given their history as a country. Hopefully this is a step toward fixing that.

So many of [NAME] haters dismiss his top 10 stat placement. Never understood that.
Stop being disgusting. I dont know if you know this but all dogs are naked.

I'd give them a first, but they have to retain salary. You know they'll just destroy that first round pick too.
i gasped. This sucks. He was very very sick and I hope he's at peace.

If money's not a problem for you and you badly need to get braces then go for it, the sooner the faster your teeth can get adjusted.
Here's a thought, everything that wasn't redacted he didn't have time to pass on before he was caught.
I‚Äôm incredibly jealous of you and yours. Congratulations. Maybe someday I‚Äôll have someone.. but I dream.

There's really no way to know since my lady hormones prevent me from remembering sexual assaulters' identities.
I was talking about have a more positive outlook on life if it's meaningless anyways.
Nope. I‚Äôm not wrong. Flipper superficially inflate housing prices without substantively contributing to their value.
They just forgot to key in your lunch breaks. Still be happy you‚Äôre getting 40
My [NAME]. I think we have a winner. IT'S. A. REAL. PLACE. Best part

Flip him for another 3rd rounder hah
No reason to bet the flop.
your vehicle is pretty!
So glad you left this note. This is the way it‚Äôs done! Newspaper (or similar) and everything.
I don't really see what the point of this post is.
The whole team looks awful yet half the comments in here are still targeting one player.
Fuck yeah, I eighteenth this. 
It do be like that sometimes.
I really hope not. Personally I have no interest in VR games, and not even my favorite game would change that.
[NAME] is killing it! I really like her, she's got a future me thinks.
Yeah I should have said ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt it be ironic‚Äô
Who hurt you?
‚ÄúAm I in the frat now, bruh?‚Äù
The thought that the armed forces of the US unironically use it is hilarious.
Don't be mad, life is too short!
That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. 
Yes he is a very good pup check out his insta if u want its in the post
GG. We played as best as we could. Utah just a better team.
Holy heck I'm so happy for you! That shit is an expense no one needs to worry about, and nor you don't! :D
[NAME] has presented himself
Everyone's invited
That sounds really cool! I'll be there
I came in here to ask why he‚Äôd drive so far to see a movie about testicular torsion
It should go well with kratom anyway. I need to just eliminate anxiety and not have cravings
"That's what I said! I'm like ""I wonder how he kept that much of the profits?!"""
Yeah.. like 30ish BBs deep I don‚Äôt think about it twice, just re-jam and be a sad boy. But we are so fucking deep...
Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking.
It‚Äôs so fucking creepy
I bet he jerks off while holding a gun in his mouth while crying.
[NAME] needs more love
Ehh, that was $4M on an arbitration ask. Not really out of line. 
I wondered where the quote about ‚Äúsupporting your azz‚Äù and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
And ALL of you will tune in next week because it‚Äôs the best trash TV ever created!
No, but it changes the expectations that people have for you. You have so deliberately change who you are to play to your target audience.
I‚Äôm Asian...and the first thing bullies go for are the eyes. No one ever cares that I have black hair.
I'm sad for the bot. They only want a purpose
Nobody got time for that, Dont even like twitter
He sunk their house into the ground and blamed the architect and every episoode after that his beard gets a little less washed ü§î
Because I've lost control of my life.
Thanks Mate. [NAME] is awesome
Nice job on those renders, they look great
Time's up! Time's up! Time's up! Time's up!
Both good and not so good, but mostly good! You should DESTROY HER. NOBODY NEEDS TO TAKE UP THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE CURB. 
Yeah highkey looks decent
Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
"Oh is this the ""not real burgers"" argument? Just cause you don't like them doesn't mean they're not burgers"
She‚Äôs got time to clap back cause she left the gig early huh?
Dont get stuck in deep thought too much or you could loose focus but i have no problem as long as my vision is not impaired.
[NAME] got pushed down when through on goal ref has to call that
"Also these people: ""millennials are so desensitised to violence that they have no problem shooting up schools"" "
Ya? I don't really remember him much besides his crappy penalty shot attempt. What stuck out about him to you?
Stumbling out of a closet in full [NAME] outfit... I'm afraid it's not
*it's free real essential oils*
Kinda both, they maintain a pin-up section in their newspaper bizarrely enough. Not like any of the credible newspapers in the province ever needed that.
Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.
Na. Rediting my post. Sorry for the ignorance.
And yet, it‚Äôs bad to manipulate people. Which is what the in laws are doing. 
I know! I'd buy this for my unit my coworkers would love it üòÇ
A joke is subjective pal, second of all you need to mature/grow up and get a taste of the real world before giving your political opinions.

Couldnt agree more.
Your sacrifice will be remembered.
great reference my friend
Arrogance of the highest order.
Ha interesting. Grew up in MN and never thought about this.
Damn, that sucks.
It's great, though kind of painful if you ever had dreams of writting/drawing/making a comic/game/novel it hurts a lot.
Sweetener is full of bops! Wish she would release another single from it.
Skeptical approach, always lol
It looks like a very light blue to me.
That's what you get for being a drama queen.
No it‚Äôs ok. How does [NAME] feel about his mom hovering? Are there plans to move out or is this a permanent thing?
That's not how any law works
Stranger things have happened.
That was actually pretty satisfying
Why make it a video? Could have just been a text post.
LOL how can anyone trust you when you pretend that you voted for [NAME] when your clearly racist against blacks. Your user name is strictly a lie.
You‚Äôre welcome, glad to help!
"I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do drugs and yet still am not ""happy rich and all that people say this brings"""
She may want you and your boyfriend out, so her daughter can take the bedroom. A family meeting might force her to be honest.
Everyone in this video is annoying. This seems like a terrible place to go hang out.
> Honestly, I think ANY (maybe not NY) state beats CA when it comes to gun laws. WA is nipping at your heels.
Did you read the post?
Not to mention she didn't get her rightful Snatch Game win
Very nice.
Be more supportive, think about the long road not the moment.

They‚Äôre just idiots parking there. No clue that it is a designated bike lane.
It took 8 years of healing before I could open my journals. Pace yourself, you'll heal, friend.
Oh he dead
I couldn‚Äôt agree more! I think deep down all I wish for is some weird validation from women
Personal insults aren't allowed around here. 1 week ban for first offense.

The blonde one of the news and yer man off Corrie
How I hate the black tarp on top...prevents the fan from blowing air in summer.
Is this supposed to be compelling? Either defend the argument I'm putting into question, or explain why my issue with it doesn't hold.
It's always something with AM though isn't it
She probably has a kid by now.
As someone who is dairy intolerant (milk is in _everything _!!) this veganuary is awesome :D
Better than any HBr, anyway
Apparently lots
He‚Äôs been going to a restaurant for 40 years and forgot what it looked like and where it was.. uh huh.
Wouldn‚Äôt cheddar tear for that joke
I sort of did lol. I think what I mean is that you cant look at it as an alternative to rdp
Hahahahaha, no there isn't. Thank god. Tell your friend he's an idiot for us.
Broncos one was harder being state rivals and us being spoken of as possible contenders, only to get smashed after taking an early lead
There are a lot of miserable people on reddit, don‚Äôt let them get to you 
I think ignoring intentions is ridiculous too, but I also think that only looking at intentions (and at face value) is a bit naive
How about we get no wall and Medicare for all. Then only the good ideas get funded.
Great. My existential crisis is back.
Thanks for explaining the point he was making.
Recently i was shopping with my girlfriend and she saw something she liked. So after I dropped her off at work I went back and bought it.
Normally yeah but that was my friends first match ever and to encounter such a killer, who was running noed too is kinda disheartening for him
Thanks!
I'd be honored
You guys are horrible. I love it.
What if gets in your belly button? And doesn't it trickle down the side?
They could've added two dots and a line and it could have been better
I will never understand why streaming is entertaining.
I do. Skull Splitter rules.
To all of you who never had to take the SATs, consider yourselves lucky.
I feel like this anime will make me cry in the end. Damn even its opening is full of drama. Am I correct in this?
Damnit, you beat me to it.
I wishhhh. She‚Äôs honestly what started getting me the fuck away from centrism
[NAME], loved the story. Personally I don‚Äôt think this was petty I think it was quite fair and right. Good job dude.
I work with food - being able to eyeball tbs for recipes is an odd perk I never thought about. Thank you.
Still curious if they try and trade [NAME]. One thing is for sure I‚Äôm not ruling anything out. [NAME] and the FO is getting very creative
I know how you feel and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. But I‚Äôm glad you are still here
Unfortunately for [NAME], when [NAME] meet her on the battlefield, his machete will not hesitate. 
[NAME] I still love my [NAME] family too
SHE BETTER NOT SNITCH ON HIM HE WAS JUST LOOKING OUT FOR HER
it is weird, looks like you have awesome internet
I love [NAME] so much, but honestly it's great news that they refused to go back to that system. Hoping for [NAME].
Google owns youtube.
I can‚Äôt imagine choosing McD‚Äôs over Banh Mi, that‚Äôs just a complete lack of respect for your taste buds.
I always associate it with a 1985 Ford Taurus going 100 miles per hour down the shoulder lane.
Looking at the thread now, it seems that this comment was also deleted.
Low hanging fruit my friend, [NAME] the easiest target or them all.
Yeah, considering guns by themselves aren‚Äôt an issue (like I so thoroughly explained to you), that‚Äôs a valid argument. 
That thread is awesome. I can't believe it's this guy that unites us all
I'm kind of struggling tonight. Bored, lonely... man 
"Reminds me of ""It's your city!"" back in The Flash 2X08."
Man, thats ruthless. Lesson learned. Trust me, there will be a time when they actually need money and I really hope you say no. 
Jokes on [NAME]. I only use Facebook to follow the defectives.
One wrong kick can end oh so horribly
I get abused on the daily fam ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç
the older i get the more it hurts
Is that [NAME]?
And then they say, ‚ÄúHAHAHAHHA IT WAS RIGHT THERE WOW!‚Äù
Ah I had no idea!
I never said you did? I'm just going off the conspiracy that's been going around for awhile about her being a clone
That would be hilariously vicariously through the subterranean passages to the bottom of this post.
My man!! You go. That's brilliant. Brightened my day.
Your inability to formulate an argument is what's most humorous. Oh great philosophers of free speech... Thanks for the laugh. Happy New Year!
SS: Collapse of the west, and re-birth, all in a beautiful video.
It's not a fair question.
at least you found it
Touche lol. Ours usually comes back pretty quickly, I think this is the longest it's been out.
Just make sure you don't go too far and get a 17hmr!
I stand corrected. IQ is not worthless. Knowing ones own IQ aids in masturbation.
Yes but legal issues and plus its a bit weird tbh. She doesn't look 19.
"[NAME]: ""and [NAME] with *another* clutch three!"" Me: ""WHOMST?!"""
I love how he is gonna hit that fat dude and the gif ends
Saw this on the front page and that was the only thing i could think of!
I think the [NAME] person is a Prequel and [NAME] memer right? Like this basically confirms it
I‚Äôm already close to 50. It should be getting really interesting about the time I die.
hell yeah my brother
And also something against [NAME]. (My definition of [NAME] is just people at the bottom of love distribution)
I have no shame in saying I still have my blanket from when I was a child. And a favorite [NAME] plushie.
 I'm scared to even ask my mom ,I might get yelled at üòü
Any weaving subreddits you'd recommend?
It's always been a dodgy road, proposals were put in ages ago
I once had a guy yell something obscene from the window of his truck and throw a half full beer can at me too... good times
The fact that her pillows are brown is way more disturbing to me
I actually felt my ballsack jump up a bit when he face planted
Its not too late for you either, it'd never too late! Please, leave the bad behind and go chase your dreams! You deserve it!
Yea that's nonsense
he left the company 2 years ago. he is not listed as a shareholder in the parent company.
Nobody, thinks desi is offensive. Source : I am Indian. 
[NAME] YOU SLIME
Thats pretty lewd.
Thank you; I hope so too.
No problem mate. If you're looking for activities, give these boys a look: 
I think, on my next play through I‚Äôm going to save right before so I can keep going back and reliving this night! Lol
One of my all-time favorite bands, and one of the best live acts you'll ever see!
How can you look at that. it hurts.
It's nothing compared to how scaled down tyreal's wings are: Look at just how massive they are in this d2
Did you know that [NAME] and [NAME] named one of their children after a suburb in Pretoria? How cool is that!
[NAME] and a top 60 protected second rounder for [NAME]. Who says no
Lighten up buddy.
I can't really provide anything to you that you haven't already deliberately misread yourself. I can't force you to be honest.
just keep swimming further off that deep end
People are still playing bf1?Wow thats nice,I should play some games until more content drops for bf5.
Yeah you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm not fit for the position! Thank you for giving me the right words to say. 
I'm just messing with you, dont be mad! I actually upvoted you, its probably just burried under all the downvotes.
Its a sign
I don‚Äôt get it why are you quoting this Edit can someone explain how he got me and not just downvote lol
TFW a sorceror cuts you root and stem and you hear someone's voice in flames as your junk burns.
Can these guys just pick a team in the AL and go there??
A cheater is always a cheater in my book.
Whoever the mod is that removed this needs to rethink their priorities.
I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
It's annoying. You always gotta give the other guy a chance. That's how MMA works
This...has 9k upvotes. Wow.
Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit.
Ok. He is likely done in the NHL after this season I guess.
That would be the greatest night ever!
That‚Äôs not true*
Serious question, where was this? That looks like my ex in the green top.
the scarf look cumbersome and heavy for her frame.
Ohhhhh that couple!
Many are interested due to [NAME] still high potential ceiling. And improved defensive abilities
[NAME] a real one. Anyone who don‚Äôt know his background should check out his interviews.
Did either of those places declare independence out of the blue? No.
He wasn‚Äôt drafted and is properly rated imo. Had a crazy career for sure. Beat the odds many times
But, it entertains you.... in some way. Thats the point dude.
And so are you
I don't find it awkward, it's relaxing and I want to enjoy having some else wash and cut my hair.
That isnt sustainable.
She been thinking about this for months. No one suddenly says divorce. Move in cuz clearly she has.
what piece of work does he most talk about that bottom bit in? thanks mate - clean your lobster
Thanks! I'll look into that
but he got a chainsaw hand. that's pretty cool
They say nature makes man feel small, but I wasn't expecting this
It was a reference to earth 1s laurels arc. We honestly dont know enough about earth 2 laurel to come up with anything that wouldnt be overarching speculation.
That‚Äôs what we keep trying to tell TSCC!!! ;)
These posts must make people want to be security guards.
[NAME] screaming that to [NAME] was so funny to me
hes got a clear weakness on his forehand side though. not sure if injury related or just ... ???
I love happy endings.
Sadly I know lots of peeps that would find this dude hot. He has that LA 90‚Äôs Persian chic thing going for him
Fuck my life
These people seen so much in their lifetimes. So much wisdom in one pic

Sorry it didn't help. I hope you can find something that does.
Now it makes sense.
That such a sad flop [NAME]
Gets right back on his phone call. I like it. Must‚Äôve been one important booty call.
And now I regret not applying when they opened one in my town even more now. Good times.
Those got me once when I was about 6 because I wanted to go up two steps at a time. I still do that to this day...
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that friend :(. It‚Äôs for the best most likely if she didn‚Äôt accept you for who you are
And then they clapped and gave you $100, I'm sure
Seconded! [NAME] is gorgeous.
Nice Sir !
The [NAME] of horror!
Neither does she because her lips are too large to talk
Sad, but American
Not sure how you could put [NAME] there, he's been our worst defender 
12. He gets beat up by a total LOSER by the name of [NAME].
I love [NAME] comedy. I hope she makes another show.
LN is flawed by design and BTCs limited on-chain capacity cannot carry mainstream LN onboarding.
Yo, we doink'n in here?
The most important part of a sacrifice is the innocence of the victim. (Even we [NAME] belive that). The unborn are the most innocent.

Entering the race is not about winning. It‚Äôs about increasing name recognition.

[NAME] is not a smart man. Giving a fraud a fucking card. Like wtf
I'm so sorry! I hope you are doing better!
Finally some good vibes in this sub, im happy for you man!!
I can‚Äôt tell who you‚Äôre referring to.
Wow!! very funny
That, but I also really think that [NAME] is going to be a top QB. Especially, if he progresses during his time as back up.
You got it!
Fuck it, maybe the faceless men worship the great other AND assassinated the fire warlocks in valyria, hwo knows?

Good luck mate!
Doesn't mean they're not feminists
Yeah I hope he can play against IU that‚Äôd be a huge loss
Definitely not a dead human body. He‚Äôs probably just a weird dude that has some weird thing in his room that smells terrible.
Thank you :) I'm trying to hang out with friends more, I felt like I was quite distant from them because of him
Well modern first world commies don't do anything, so that's good
One of those is not like the others.
You've been able to survive going in between tracks on multiple games in the franchise. I've always done it lol
Because it's incredibly cringy.
That cowboy was pretty deft
Most people don't know the first thing about [NAME], so unsurprising.
I like both.
Howd i get downvoted? Lmao. I love drones and think they cant be beat for SaR and aerial mapping... thats why i forwarded the proposal!
Damn. You sure showed me.
Absolute mad lad
They ate not hot, they are just annoyingly humid.
Oh definitely, there was reports of [NAME] and his supporters using Spam to spread misinformation throughout the entire campaign.
They leave me out of everything
What song was that earlier ? It went oooh oooh ooooh oooh oooh oooh.
I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry.
hey, everything's okay right now? 
That looks absolutely awful. On the good side, whoever made it, can only get better.

These refs have it out for the colts. I didn't realize we traded our MVP 11 to KC either.
I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.
Can someone please explain what is happening.
I don't really understand what they are even proposing or how realistic it is to implement. It just sounds like empty words.

his talk show is pretty great
most issues with nervousness and anxiety can be eliminated by eliminating the bad habits that are causing them to begin with, instead of 'just exercising/meditating' more
Is she worse than [NAME] though?
WHEW that was quite a stretch lad. Gotta do some deep breathing to stretch that far.

"Pretty sure you don't know what ""hurt"" means"
Can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre letting [NAME] go. So much energy since he‚Äôs come on.
Are you lost?
The counter-clockwise was a bit too much for even a real anti vaxxer tho.
Very happy with this !
I agree. I could tell she was really upset.
Peel the avocado...
So, modern day imperialism. 
[NAME] man hope your luck changes soon. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll patch it up in the future
I am so sorry for your loss and all the stress you have right now. All the internet hugs you want right now! <3

[NAME] is untouchable fam
"Lol I saw a comment on this article that said ""but who released the measles germs into the public? ü§î"""
No... There are many ways to prove you are [NAME]. I've heard of people that proved they are [NAME] by showing that their mother speaks Yidish.
This thread was actually inspired by one of your comments
I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.
OK, I'll be glad to help you with your trip! 
"On BBC Parliament: ""Brussels will be watching this as well."" Will they? Do they have a TV Licence?!"
When I see [NAME] venerate icons it makes you wonder if they have OCD. /s The joke is that [NAME] cross themselves more than others in my experience.
It happened in back to back home games earlier this season but hasn‚Äôt happened since.
They're a Queens family. [NAME] would be one of those dudes who sits outside of Bodegas and bothers high school girls when they walk by.
That‚Äôs reasonable
Imagine if [NAME] wins the power and uses it at the noms, not realizing [NAME] wasn't even planning on nominating her lol
Man your post really struck me I feel exactly the same way you do. I‚Äôm tired and I feel like it‚Äôs too much work.
ESPN and sports is not a good combination.
No, there‚Äôs a ton of people like you in this thread who don‚Äôt seem to understand that head glitching does not equal taking cover.
That's how you're supposed to serve a pretzel, so it doesn't go soggy whilst lying flat on a plate. 
I forgot it‚Äôs Saturday r/trees :) If you read the rules you get this
I don't understand why [NAME] is starting it on the feet..
Neat stuff!
Oh, I ripped one üòâüçÅüî•üòóüí®‚òÅÔ∏èüíØ‚òÅÔ∏èü§ôüèª
Wheres [NAME] to make sense of all this?!
Suffice it to say, I understand why you want to build one, although I disagree with both the solution and how you arrived at the conclusion. 
I don't believe that there's any justification for an authoritarian government.
"""I like it when you x"", ""can you try doing y?"" - focus on positive and giving advice"
Actually maybe the OP is not an INTP, have you thought about that!!
Natural or not monopolies aren't good.
Anyone with a mirror?

Try to listen to yourself. I should have done that more.
Yes!! THANK YOU. I‚Äôm happy the point of this story was not lost among all.
That is disgusting. And not one parent thought that was a *bit* inappropriate? smh
Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
How mature of you. Resorting to name-calling is delightfully childish. I expected nothing less.
I‚Äôd love for [NAME] to turn into prime [NAME]

Excited for season 3 too. Winter is getting too cold
When I saw this troll comment of yours it was 9 minutes old and already had 2 upvotes. Unusual activity for this sub.
Your question was is 4.2 inch small for an erect penis, my answer is yes it is. 
Sensationalism as usual
Tell him, that just as he has a very shy person and I told her just to get a pretty woman with a strapon.
But his parents love him and that's what‚Äôs important /s

Yes, I'm just banking on the fact that there will be a bigger idiot than me out there. :-)
It was SO refreshing to see. [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] were all so well coordinated. Hype
Which part of what I wrote sounds like a baseless claim? Could you clarify me, please?

This is a good map though.... Just needs some minor QOL tweaks.
You're so cool.
Wonder how that brother or cousin excuse works when Lus have no brothers or male cousins
But then I never would have gotten to see the double doink!
It's also about anyone else who feels down or attacked by misandrist social signals. Finding ways to counteract these signals and their effects is a worthwhile pursuit.
Cheers to that, girl. ü•Ç 
OP should first talk to his Priest about this and try to reconcile with his faith. It's a big thing for a [NAME] to leave.
it was audrey! I painted this painting 10 years ago. today I took it off my sisters wall and decided to give her a make over
I'm glad the republican won cause I want the best high I have had 5 back surgeries and need another.

"AS AN ITALIAN MAFIA ONCE SAID ""LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY"" "
I have several questions.
For sure. Thank you.
It just looked like blue fire to me. And I think there was a behind-the-scenes thing that said they made the fire blue to differentiate.
Sad but true.
Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
The weak should fear the strong
That might be the first time I've seen [NAME] block a shot
> [NAME] HAHAHAHSHSHAJSHA
Oh my heck, thanks so much for correcting me. üòÜ
I‚Äòm sorry this guy is harassing you, check his history, he‚Äòs trolling.
How dare you assume my mortality! >:O
Are they dead? I don‚Äôt recall this bit of the Nativity play.
That seems stupid.
Imagine spending the day having to hear excuses from people slowly killing themselves. He's too kind.
Please tell me you were buying something extremely embarassing!
Talking about my feelings.
This is true, but he's perceived as white by most liberals. 
Do you hate China then?
Glad your SO was helpful and hopefully you are better
Having read the entire article, and some of the other FAQ, the only thing this is telling is that [NAME] read the same book very differently.
West Ham is the retirement home for players that used to be good/talented some years ago.
"Agreed. If anyone was ""murdered by words"" it was all the posts, including the top posts that make [NAME] look like an idiot."
Any time. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Just don‚Äôt drink your emotions like I did.
stay away from players lol
hope everything ended up alright, op! 
You want me to go searching around for that? I'm good. I'll just assume you're wrong because of the way you type.
Thanks that's very helpful because I can't seem to decifer all of the levels of irony in some posts on this subreddit haha.
why arent they all laying on the floor???
The finest example of an egotistical, ignorant and racist piece of trash. Humans like this disgust me.
This will end well.
Yeah, the Wall is a non-starter. It's bigotry. You don't spend 25 billion on bigotry.
Wise people don‚Äôt equate wise with any political orientation . Wise people know there are bozos screaming on both sides.
If fathers could have a say though... do you really think that would result in less children?? Id say it would result in more..
lol not bullying. Just a socially aware nerd complaining about how annoying most of my people are. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I almost pissed myself waiting so long in the tunnel. Not a fun feeling
Sorry, no. We‚Äôre just going to export [NAME] to you guys. 
[NAME] sounds so depressed
I just dropped out of my science class without being at school, hot damn
I AM LITERALLY FREAKING THE FUCK OUT

Thank you for providing an unbiased & sensible opinion.
Gonna be sad when Gameday is inside a gym for shooty hoops. I already miss CFB :(
I actually got her IG from the video above. If it‚Äôs an issue, the video should be removed. 
It'll get better. I know sometimes it's hard to believe that, but it's true. Promise.
Yup, thanks, I've got someone coming this week - good idea
Great, another article from a guy who thought making [NAME] the head coach was the answer.
Fuck [NAME] pai
Pull your fucking pants up oh my god
It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
lol reddit is for 10 year olds confirmed
Whatever happens, you will survive this. Keep your head up brother ‚úä
Yes, I do. I'm open to dating from anywhere- friends of friends, nights out, online. 
Huh? Mutts are usually healthier than pure-breds. It's the pure-bred dogs that have weird genetic issues.
I have the worst memory ever. Idk if it's from all the weed I smoked but I also have a blank mind like all the time.
Absolutely! The Republicans are craven
I like your style.
Looks weirdly fake Edit: turns out it‚Äôs real
Just for the sake of accuracy, is there a citation for this quotation. It is spicy, but I can‚Äôt bother to check right now.
Because teams do dumb things when they‚Äôre desperate.
Why does the feminization of a title belittle the role? I truly don't get it.
I‚Äôm confused why the [NAME] tax is negative savings. Otherwise great stuff .
How incredibly dangerous
I just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man
Many of them do love LEGAL ones.
Not against us this season, apparently. 
Every time I get a distinct *[NAME]* vibe. A bunch of savage children devoid of compassion and understanding.
What is it that we don't know yet about the Rebellion, if you don't mind me asking?
If I were him, I would have made sure to fall HARD the second the first officer touched me. Congrats, you're getting paid kid. 
This is not a why were they filming. The person filming clearly saw it from further away, and then got closer after turning on the camera.
I probably would have upvoted it for effort.
Its a half baked RP. If they wanted to kill each other they oculd have just started shooting.
That's great, keep fighting the good fight!
Brilliant, thanks so much!
Thank you, I know my OHIP Is up to date as I have my health card in my wallet and I updated it myself when we moved 
The map is not the territory. This is all I kept thinking.
You sound jealous as fuck. Work hard and you too can drive a nice car.
Nah, I got married in Texas about 20 minutes after I got engaged. 
Every instagram page posts this lol
i'm so poor i don't even know any horse girls
BNW is scarily accurate if you ask me.
Lol nice. I can't say the same yet. What do you do for a living if I may ask?
meanwhile on my LE smurf, i play with and against [NAME] on a solo que.
It's like they are gatekeeping tiredness. So weird.
It's only 5 mins, but I hope this is the one. Sorry that happened to you friend.
People change their minds when trust is broken.
Because you never edit babies while above an armed guard. Come on. Get it together.
The tree actually moved!!! Who is this guy?!
LHW is such a barren shithole that I‚Äôd be more excited for this than anyone at 205 getting a shot
I'm going to look so handsome for you, [NAME].
Glad to see Tael (wabi) on the list but surprised its not at the top.
Sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better soon!
It's absolutely 100% abuse, as others have said you need to get the hell away from him.
Oh hi [NAME]
The stress that effects you stresses the baby before it‚Äôs born. It effects the bond you have and even your milk supply if you breastfeed.
It would feel amazing. Which would scare you. So you would crush it. Along with yourself.
"Promise me that when you call out his name you pronounce ""Papa-paparazzi papa-paparazzi pahhh pahhh paparazzi, dinnnner!"""
But that floor is so nice and shiny...
What's [NAME] day job because I know it can't be a therapist or talkshow host.
This dog is so cute
yeah it's not even a bad haircut
Thanks bot!
I never understood the part where he dives into a pile of money, even as a child. It seems wildly painful.
YOU STOLE MY GODDAMN COMMENT! <3
Wow, you weren't instantly downvoted hundreds of times. The omniscum must have had a salad once and got a protein deficancy.
I once hi-fived the GCS mascot and loved to tell the tale, [NAME]!
I wish an asteroid would wipe us out.
Sure. Let's wait and see how much impact they have.
Thanks! I've just been so irritable. I am proud of myself and my husband too.
we had someone complain about us making announcements once for that exact reason
I was thinking the same and was relieved when I read peed on kitchen floor!
So you think I can not find it anywhere? I love that sweatshirt yes you help me! thank you!
"I think it's hilarious you guys think this will ""help"" [NAME] Yeah [NAME] was bad, but [NAME] didn't show very much either"
After a few tequila in a dark alley in Mexico, yeah In a restaurant, nah
I mean I like the park and I was surprised by that poll too
You‚Äôd think the higher ups would look at how much these law suits are costing and tell their boys and girls to tone it the fuck down.
But economic systems do determine success of societies. If your economic system doesn't work, your political system will lean towards authoritarianism for it's politics.
my parents did this for 8 years. apparently it‚Äôs a lot of fun
I cried reading your last posts. I‚Äôm so sorry about what happened. I hope you are able to make a change in their system.
Fuck you're cool
Good luck with that!
Oh yeah.
And then everyone clapped and the teacher got on his hands and knees, begging to be spared from your superior intellect.
That's so cool üòÄ thanks!
If that‚Äôs true, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree, term limits are a bandaid on an open chest wound. 
Thank you so much. Fur babies are one of a kind.
Yeah hed be a pure rental so maybe [NAME] is too much. [NAME] on his contract is definitely not worth assets though. Closer to a negative asset imo
Wait this is what chill looks like? Some girl told me that I look dead amd I flinch at the slightest movement. You really call that chill?
They're men, they view the vagina as a hole to stick things in, they too have a hole to stick things in. Indistinguishable!
Thank you. I‚Äôve been doing more research about today, there‚Äôs definitely a lot to consider.
You do right, if you don't care then fuck 'em!
Got boarded, ejected, and ship damaged... very poor tactic.
Are you really that brain dead.....idiot!!!
I think it's normal. Don't analyse how you look like and worry about it btw, those idiots sure don't when they say their bullshit
Stu if you ever say the Pats will beat my Chiefs again I will rain anarchy. BIG THROWS PAT IS GONNA DO IT.
Downvoted for pointing it out, too!
this is so true!
Lol. Your dad made me laugh. Tell him thanks.
This is why business and family should never mix.
He was hooking you up, hoping you both could hook up 
We all know you like men who kill lol, so I can see why you'd downplay it.
Im so interested in learning more about the Garrison EU.
Eso me cae bien. I was just thinking that contending to make the playoffs in a few years was a depressingly low goal.
Worst CB we‚Äôve had in recent memory
I'm sorry, but this has also caught my attention and I kinda want to see this screenplay.
Yeah, I always get about 6 episodes deep and then start hate-watching just to see if they ever actually fall in love.
Take my up vote...you owe me a punchline you bastard.
An Asuka reference in fatlogic?! Love it.
This seems like an excessive amount of work that I don't think (maybe I just don't know any better?) adds any value.
I am honored to be your only comment
Totally zero bias at all as we know feminist scholars aren't bias and always correct no matter what.
Just cut your losses, get out and don't look back!
She's obviously off her meds...!
Okay idiot, well it seems right wingers can't tell the difference between strawman and reality then. Thanks for confirming it douchebag. 
Oh getting down voats. The EU fascists don't like it when you speak out against the 4th Reich.
HER VOICE IS SO GOOD no wonder she likes phone calls
Let‚Äôs beat these Lakers!

I actually enjoy watching this while eating
Kid looks like he's about to cry
[NAME] is terrible with sports. They're still butt hurt because [NAME] gave them a tough time in the dungeon of doom.
My favourite moment of the game by my favourite player.
‚ÄúThe big fella‚Äù
This is simply honesty + humility. Indeed, very respectable.
My suspension of disbelief was shot, I don't even know if the court case ended with a hell in the cell match
So clearly you have vast knowledge of linear algebra and can fact check the entire paper Nd disprove it?
[NAME] will be proud of people who share links from conspiracy websites in order to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù him. Hahahahaha
You cannot open or keep it. You can send it RTS.
Happy Another Day random strangers!
Beautiful play by [NAME]. Dude gets better every game he plays.
You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
i like how he just bursts in like DID SOMONE WANA SEE ME ROL OVR !?!
Being compared to [NAME] is a compliment because he‚Äôs funnier than I‚Äôll ever be soooo
Yes. Ignore and move on
1. Dr. [NAME] job is just cause drama and look frustrated 2. I wanna know the mothers of people ITT
And now, I would imagine it's impossible to own a Maserati without people constantly asking you if it goes 185.
I considered becoming a teacher, but then I considered the little bastards would eat me alive.
No? Lol
Did [NAME] funnel money to any paramilitaries?
Sorry if this has been covered a bunch but what happened on the play where [NAME] got injured?
Ooohh... [NAME] wouldn't like that!!
this is painful
Come on, this would be funny with a better caption.
Probably the most rational way to look at this entire scenario - thanks for posting this my dude. That comment set me straight again.
Yes, please do. I'd appreciate any help.
Thanks friend, you have a good day! ([NAME] is fab btw just not quite [NAME] or [NAME] for me!)
Toy department hype! So hard to keep from using caps!
I'm so happy to hear you've recovered. Can I ask: are you able to maintain a healthy, stable romantic relationship?
I LOVED having him; every time [NAME] takes that 18 footer I expect to be automatic only to be very disappointed.
How so? Genuinely curious, I've yet to make a judgment here, as I'm not informed enough. Edit: typo
Someone did this when the roommate was breaking into her room and trying to leave dirty cat litter in it
His head bounced on the hardwood. Damn.
yes, because I like her already anyway
Well I get annoyed when they dont, because I'm always the one to answer within 30 seconds.
How did anyone not know what this movie was? WE HAVE OUR OWN RELIGION.
No friends anymore, but had a guy get jealous at another guy flirting with me.
you don‚Äôt appreciate the good times till you go through the bad.. things will get better OP, stay strong
We also one because [NAME] straight took that game over late.
He will, they both look totally re-integrated. If not, they'll thrash the rockets bench guys lol
Never doubt the crazy can get cranked up, as they say, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
Adding a few projectile characters only made the game better, not worse. Bars can go though.
Wipe them out, all of them!
I kind of liked that one song he did with [NAME]. I forgot the name though.
D'oh... 1970! Good lookin out!
Here, we [NAME] are open books. Brutal, and often hilarious truth in every word we speak üòÇ
I crave nuts and nut butter all üëè the üëè damn üëè time. I think my body know they‚Äôre calorie and nutrient dense üòÇ

I thought that I was on the IASIP sub...
"I was just thinking to myself ""maybe I should get Tinder"". Thank you for reassuring me that, nah I'm good without it."
I would never tell anyone stick is better than pad, but speaking personally, it's way more fun
Ok nice opinion dude. Do you have any sources??
this is why I love reddit
Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha
"I love you guys but.....""existence"""
Too many people using it to justify bigotry. Mostly homophobia, transphobia, sexism, etc etc.
I didnt realize wishing Liberty would open their wallet would make it happen... It sucks, but it's the reality. We need value.
HAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAa no
He‚Äôs just tired and needs to rest.
Could you point to a specific policy of [NAME] that was to the left of [NAME] on race please?
Got damn look at that body
Doesn't mean we can't improve on what we have
If they even took one history class about the 70s, they'd realize that this whole list was somehow ridiculously wrong.
Ah. Will to Power vs The World as Will and Representation. My googling got me so close yet so far.

She actually did
Beautiful face, but scenically over the top
Thank you, this isn't the first time they have tried to control us with money. They always put odd stipulations on money or gifts.
That wasn‚Äôt part of my plan
[NAME] has a great bit on this topic.
It‚Äôs deeply bizarre.
Make time for someone who makes time for you. Full stop.
Lots Of Love
I wish. It's been over 72 hours for me now, nothing. Less than .5 ETH, BCH and BSV - hasn't moved.
There is a surprisingly large number of [NAME] who play.
Oh by bad

That water looks like it has alligators in it.
Thanks. I unlocked them 5 min ago. Just placed them in front of driving tanks and killed some infantry with the MG‚Äòs.
True , when this song started playing, I got my first ‚Äú Gone Fishing‚Äù signature. Loved that game. Thanks for sharing.
I find it boring and, at times, incredibly annoying in all of the games. It completely lost its appeal somewhere around Black Flag.
Totally came to ask this question too!
It‚Äôs only the 3rd safest car ever tested, can‚Äôt take any chances!
Sports, not even once
Because this creep wanted to put his hands on the girl.
But i really need you to delete the comment
There are many tv manufacturers like Twitter, tumblr, 4chan, Instagram and even Reddit itself. Everyone is stealing TVs from each other
For me it is easier to believe that the Big Bang occurred via a natural process than through an external agent such as some god.
Okay, thank you so much!
I guess I'm just too nice to people and I gotta learn to start sayin no.
This too. It‚Äôs about how much excess the wealthy have, not how they acquired it.
mom can you give me money? to buy [NAME]? yeeees. actually buys relief pitcher like a boss ottavino time
Fantastic!!
[NAME] sweetie i‚Äôm so sorry
I wonder how that works if the seatbelt wouldn‚Äôt fit even if they were sitting in a regular seat? They only go so far, right?
True but I am a fan of [NAME] and I'm just relieved he pulled through even if his victory did not make me any richer.
Was it the same bike on the unreleased,MISC cover?
Is it only possible for men to be crossdressers? I‚Äôve never heard a woman called that, even if she‚Äôs dressed like a man.

Yeah, [NAME] stans cannot get enough of it. In their little bubble [NAME] can outsmart a queen with experience in dealing with petty people. 
Ironic. He could save others from secrecy-enabled corruption, but not himself.
Ha, I'm with you on that one.
Sometimes the mouse attacks the snake ! I think you should start dating if he is going to be a asshat.
If you bought it from Levi‚Äôs I think they do it for free at their flagship store
Absolute woo-woo.
[NAME] alright dude
Thanks for the advice, i appreciate it.
Omw. When my man sends me that I get all warm and excited cuz I know I get to spends the next couple hours or days with him
You‚Äôre an amazingly helpful man. All the rumours about you are false.

I wish I could retort with peep show memes about nazis and pints now. Haha! Cheers
Did I say he was a scammer? I said he's disgusting and there's nothing endearing about him at all. Not surprised this subreddit is defending him

You bet, sweetie ;) But I date girls so don't get too excited <3
So true. The chicks I pick up from clubbing are nothing compared to the love of a good woman.
What‚Äôs this from? An aftershow or something?
MAGA morons don't travel outside their state so they don't care about this.
A derogatory term.
I think it was roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct for the chirp or something stupid like that. I couldn't believe [NAME] got away with that
Keeps going tho. Kids got heart
Amazing, all three of those consoles are from different generations.
Me too. Book of Abraham is such a headache for the church. They would love to get rid of it I am sure.
You don't even provide a verifiable example, why should I accept your evidence.
Aww. That's cute. You're right back at square one.

I hope you are getting your levels tested! You can do some damage to yourself if they're too high.

Well, I'm pretty sure I don't act like that, but aight.
Problem is the people who don‚Äôt know the difference between a single solid yellow and a double solid yellow...
Got her game on.
Sorry, I don‚Äôt see a difference. If you are opposing people‚Äôs access to something, your opposing that thing.

[NAME] always makes my day when he's yelling at the refs
Hey, I just shared the tweet with the quote. I don't know about all that

Thank you.
I guess we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.

What's the goop website?
They‚Äôre my favorite. Just little chunkers that can‚Äôt fly and just wanna bang.
"[NAME] that website is cancer. Also I love how the main ""entertainment"" in it is straight up harassment."
It looks really pretty :D!

It's not your fault....
Oh fucking come on
That's literally how all fighting games are.
The ruling class doesn't care. Their only goal is to plunder and loot the country for their own financial gain.
Thanks! Definite props to him because he was pulling a double shift when we were at the capacity of campers.
Stop saying that ? Makes my tummy upset ü§¢ü§Æ
I was also [NAME]. We all make mistakes
Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.
You're clearly reporting all of my comments, and then acting like you don't know why they could get deleted haha, that's hilarious.
Sometimes a guy just wants to unwind and get nose deep in some chocolate starfish man

No this is what the visitation center said over the phone to [NAME] when [NAME] didn‚Äôt show up.
By pushing misleading and false information, your agenda is dividing [NAME].
Sadly no, everything was thrown around the room, and everytime I rebuilt something, it would be annihilated again.
Gee...what a guy...
No worries! Sometimes wires get crossed, I missed the mark as well.
Shh that breaks the narrative though.
Some people are lucky! Def ask your daughter.

Welcome to the club, fellow [NAME]!
Meanwhile my sister won‚Äôt even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
Thank you for the references!
Only a dozen times? That‚Äôs nothing. You can do that in one evening. You‚Äôre giving up before you even tried!
I'm on the receiving end of a breakup, and i'm not handling it well. So cheers from Germany!
Damn straight. It‚Äôs a new year, and our troubles are just opportunities for future success!
Please make this happen. It works fine for Arizona. It will work fine here. Do it.
Her meal looks pretty good...
Truer words were never typed. Loved that game.
Yeah, and you don‚Äôt learn fine intricacies in a tutorial. You learn them through playing. You‚Äôre arguing a strawman now. 
That poor snek :‚Äô(
Is there a link for razz discord?
Break ups are painful and there‚Äôs no way to avoid that. Be honest with your current girl and end it.
Struggling to get the basics with a $1,000 phone. Y‚Äôall need a reality check 
This is still one of my favorite photos.
Yikes, not good. If you can afford it I suggest getting out of dodge as quick as you can.
[NAME] made me like a sleep walker.. I did things I didn't remember doing. Scary.
I literally screamed uncontrollably for 3 months and ended up in a mental hospital.
Oh damn it! I was just on my way to the post box
They were criticizing your spelling.
I know it's easy for me to say because it wasn't me but money is money. We can always make more. Really sorry dude.
uwu guess i have to do it too
You're being loyal to your mother, who's cheating, and betraying your dad, who's faithful. You might want to think about that.
That‚Äôs where they drop off Snake Plissken, so he can rescue our President [NAME]. AKA, Escape from San Francisco.

Such a great actor because he can play so many different roles! Loved his character in Banderstach
Pokemon Go has kind of helped me with depression, tbh. 
Aww so sweet. One of mind fights to lay under mine while it‚Äôs in my lap. She loves the heat from it üòÇ
Thanks, just bought this!
That could have gone extremely badly for all involved.
Might as well give Baron [NAME] a shot. He stepped aside for [NAME], he probably deserves a real shot now. 
Best of luck mate. I‚Äôve yet to reach my limit but this brought me closer
Hence the apology note.
He has a humiliation kink. He's clearly not expressing it in a healthy way and should probably see a therapist and/or a professional [NAME].
THIS is a good reply, and I have kids.
Cheers, [NAME]!
I watched the first loop before it registered what she was doing then my brain locked up and I made a noise like smeagol being strangled.
No, everyone should should stop talking about the rights of groups of people, and start talking about *human* rights.
Oh [NAME] please don‚Äôt put them in a team together.
Never heard of high app but will look now!! Thanks for posting peeps!
It fucking better have draft assets
Yeah, sadly, looks like this champ will be pretty opressive. 
On the other hand, I'm pretty sure the Phoenix VA is actively trying to kill me lol.
There have been multiple threads about this, they can't afford to move up. It's not financially feasible.
Had to go check for myself
Or he fetishizes about them. You never can tell.

They are worth the time it takes to write them. Thank you for returning!
This is amazing, man. Kick some ass, make good food, get paid. Congratulations
I feel so bad for [NAME]. It was probably hard to concentrate on this match with the things going on in his personal life
That is not the typical sexual dynamic in western cultures. That's a crazy asshole.
I'm sure they love plenty of other snacks just as much!
Pikachu shocked.jpg I hope we give him a fair chance and he succeeds
I don't think so. I think he is courting a secular crowd of young confused secular people searching for meaning in their lives.
Judging from your post history, it's not a hard assumption to make. EDIT: Now to downvoting. [NAME] tier uberman playing 65D checkers with me
Where else can you get deer ears and a flower crown on your selfie?
I agree with your guy. Sex can sometimes improve with the adulterous partner, because he/she feels desired and sexy again.
> It almost feels like this is totally a shameless, contentless promo post for your YouTube channel and this book.
So why wouldn‚Äôt the white Sox just offer an extra $20 million
Happy to hear that :). Where are you from btw?

Heat back in the day. You would go in and there would be a horrible mix of Joop aftershave and Bourbon in the air.
Sorry I failed to mention I'm relatively new to the scene . Last 2 years only
No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.
I hate that. PC is way better for using the internet. I also hate how all the important features for the website missing on phone version.
He is warped by porn. He's got a problem
I've got plat, the only challenge I'm missing from DLC is legions frenzy one. Completely impossible 
He did. He needs the facial hair, and that haircut is horrible he should just shave it and start over.
That‚Äôs unfortunate
I feel the same but I don't think it would be easy.
"I was not expecting the giant ""POLICE STATION"" sign. That just makes it all the better. "
you might be more of an optimist than me. hopefully you're right
I dunno man. I'll forever like [NAME], but slapping the hand of someone trying to help you up/see if you're alright is a big bitch move
Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
Show him how hilarious season 1 and 2 of Family Guy is. Then show him how incredibly stupid the rest of the series is.
^ Didn't read the article.
It doesn't. It really doesn't. I just had a 2nd one a few weeks ago.
If reincarnation is real, I hope next time I have a name that's half as awesome as [NAME].
yeah exactly! thanks for understanding.
That isn't entirely fair. We're also for harboring regular ol' right trolls, too.
Yes, because I've always wanted a father figure who throws a tantrum every time he doesn't get his way.
Umm, I don‚Äôt think empathy means what you think it means...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

aight guess the refs didn't choose us this game [NAME]
Your comment certainly does
Wow.. must have missed this. This is really fucked up if true!
Damn that's a good-looking pizza
It's when you least expect it that people hit you in the face with life It brings you back to earth
It's because men feel entitled to date young and slim women but when a woman dates tall, dark haired guys they get ballistic.
Only an idiot would visit places like China or NK. Arbitrary abductions and detentions against foreigners have happened for a long time now.
I was actually thinking about that during tonight's episode. I don't think the show would last long without [NAME] though.
Man, [NAME]. What a shame that trainwreck turned out to be. 
Hey! My numbers are 696!
It's still usually allowed if the first thing touched is ball
Your an idiot and trying to justify your ignorance.
Out of town then, too. I blocked 3/21. W00t!!!
Lol. Thanks for the laugh.
You‚Äôre a gorgeous bride! :D I love the looks you chose
lol that was just bad, [NAME] 
Wow yes, that is a perfect way to describe it.
I'm lactose intolerant, still I hope u OP and everyone else loves their slices.
Things are much better then they were a few decades ago but we‚Äôre still shrinking.
At the time it was a steal, and all the players we traded have basically been worst case scenario for the A's.
Agree, I avoid of the ones that do, pre-ordering any AAA is a no no now as well.
That's no hero to me.
this is hurting UCF's chance at a super bowl
Thank you very much! I will get some courage and do this.
This was all of my Junior history class
And dedmon is expiring. So he likely would have walked for nothing. Huge win
He's worth it I think. Dude brings it 110% every game
Vamos [NAME], keep fighting! 
You have so much to learn my sweet summer child
[NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
Not gonna lie. Sucked out a few, but am really trying to analyze my play afterwards. Thanks!
Very cool toys, very cool video, very cool hostd
Its 100% copy paste.
Just curious is this church a ‚Äúministry‚Äù with multiple branches worldwide with a ‚Äúgeneral overseer‚Äù? This sounds all too familiar.
I missed this villain of the week feel of the show. Feels reminiscent of S1 and S2.
I'm pretty relaxed thanks for the concern though
That's not fickle. That's insane and delusional. It's not some cute little quirk. It's a disconnect with reality.
Yeah, it is for the organizers
Wowowowow!!!! I‚Äôve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
Yeah, that was all you though. Goodnight and happy new year 
Gotta love January.
I was sad to see emails from multiple downtown restaurants offering free delivery through grubhub. Deliveries are going to be brutal.
Isn't that exactly what the Dunning-Kruger effect is - someone over estimating their understanding / ability?
The House comes and goes every few years. Judges hang on until they die. Congrats on the House.

Works great until you sit down and burst the banana open.
i managed to craft that super early in the game and i was so disappointed that i basically could not get drunk
you can tell she's insanely insecure by her body language and they way she poses for pics.
Aw, good times, picking off them pesky 'tennas and coyotes! Me too, I'd love that! Thank you for playing, my friend!
Then I‚Äôm sorry but this game really isn‚Äôt for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.
I would love if a double amputee walked in and have watched as they decline the poor fellar service
it is adorable that you think that
Doesn't seem like a big deal. I mean is she in the room?
Ye I never understood why they didn‚Äôt put that into the game
Sounds nicer than Missouri. Or missour-uh as the natives call it.
Also soda helps unclog patient‚Äôs feeding tubes if you wanted a gross reason to never drink soda again.

üòÇ Dude, ok your cool now
I will, Thank you!!
[NAME] please. Everyone has already figured that out.
Super [NAME] with a hat, or providing a buffed hat sounds really funny, if incredibly useless.
Definitely. I cried. A lot. But if [NAME] existence has taught me anything, it‚Äôs to hold out hope! 
My nightmare is having an iphone.
Eesh, really sorry for your loss.
Great point, that was a silly assumption for me to make. Thank you for your perspective! Editing the post now. 
Go you!
If you‚Äôre working out, juicy AF, and needing to pay for escorts you must be got damn ugly in the face. 
I mean yeah we were the best counter attacking team. That counter was so disappointing
They will just throw themselves to stay low. Smurfing is about power and control, throwing takes that away from them.

To think that Doom GOATs isn't even EM's strongest form...damn, no wonder the [NAME] are 100% on EM
He was jealous of your collection
What an absolute bloke. Keen to see him run wild this season.
Hah hah I got the quote was mocking him - it was so perfect it thought it was genuine. Quality work :D
You are taking him out of context!!!

I'm sorry, I can't hear your useless badgering over me drinking my 38' from a wine bottle and enjoying my extra $200.
Yeah, that's why I feel [NAME] or [NAME] would have a better chance.
How did he kill u with kobolds btw?i wanna know how this was done.

Sorry I dropped this /s„Éé( „Çú-„Çú„Éé)

U.S. are going to fuck this [NAME] guy so hard...he's going to need help to remove all the stars from his rectum
I liked the edgy sexual attraction. It was intense and I was drunk on it.
At least I'll have a normal lifespan
Looks like donkey foals are going for between $50-$100. That‚Äôs quite the herd.
No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
Wow she still hasn't helped even though you recognize it?

[NAME] reaction is Like she really wanted to say ‚ÄúThank God. Now I have a reason to leave‚Äù
I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.

Which has me believing [NAME] will either be a package for a pitcher with CC‚Äôs recent health issue...or he will stay and switch positions.
Avoid. Without a contract he can kick you out at short notice any time And when you pay a deposit make sure it's protected.
Can't believe people like this actually exist.

I sorta love it? Except the legs, but the faces are cool as hell. 
I do avoid it.
They really dont understand the value of an inch do they
I‚Äôm with you on that I suppose. Can only hope for the best.
It was always kind of a consideration when I did have opening and closing blinds. None of them problems anymore.
Would you mind elaborate on your viewpoints?
She has to thank him for his time first, and no throwing! You must be gentle and fold him nicely as you discard him.
Oh my gawd. WHAT?
why not get a innovative head coach? and not have your oc poached??
I‚Äôll give this a look. Thanks for consideration.
Your company sucks.
Hi, [NAME]! I am here to offer you a robot hug, and to wish you the best day of your life! -HappyFriendlyBot
the ancap ideology has spread to birds now. Our numbers grow stronger every dayüòÇ
Shit, I lost the original page. Please forgive me.
This is adorable I want an update
Anything to do with Iceland and Scandinavia has to be rad!
You've been salty since we beat y'all. That's just how mafia works my friend.
I might be able to help. A/S/L?
Thought you were gonna go steak with ketchup in that last bit, ya pulled a sneaky
Idk, r/Tinder has plenty of posts to do with awful men too lol
This stinks like Troom Troom
Same tbh hahahaha
Everyone has a purpose, just have to find what that purpose is for you. 
I see Land Rovers blushing on the side of the road all the time.
8 other justices?
Don't forget he hired some voodoo person.
I would agree. That doesn‚Äôt really address the conservative versus alt-right labeling issue though.
I love this so much. Helpful and hilarious!
I hate [NAME] omg I just do
Yup, that's exactly what happened when the alt-right took over the sub. So glad I won't get banned for saying that now.
You love her knowing her limitations, adjusting your expectations, and keeping boundaries firmly set and enforced hard.
Well what would make us special? He's vouching for his friend.
I am so sorry! I hope you are okay!
I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
I do not understand why everything in this script must inevitably explode.
I was at that game!!
i can't believe i havent seen this before. well i was going to watch nosferatu tonight but change of plan
You should have started to tickle his feet
What is it again?
Are you my coworker? I swear my boss will randomly scream and its embarrassing.
I'm British and this has definitely happened to me.. but why is it just [NAME]?
I get it but it wasn't what i was talking about.
So what is then, the race of western peoples? You're treading in very problematic territory friend
Knowing [NAME] he‚Äôd probably give [NAME] up for a 5th rounder smh
Woah Dude!!! I would be freaking out
>because SegWit transactions take up more space How much more?
Dragopolis was a less fun version of the free dinosaur game on Chrome when your internet goes out
Yes. I got accused of being a man or a bootlicker because I was a mod in a men's lib sub two years ago.
Argument a month. I should be so lucky.
Hahaha I wish I was that witty at the time, I think I was still in naive shock at the rudeness of people in retail. 
It‚Äôs not even an argument, it‚Äôs just a quote with a stupid voice.
I hope so. Either [NAME] or [NAME] deserve it the most
In that conversation it was the girl being boring and closed... sometimes it‚Äôs not your fault and people feel they‚Äôre the ones being awkward
For sure...sometimes I feel like I will just evaporate into nothingness as the stranger in the mirror looks on.
No that began a long time ago... under the sea...
That dude's dumb. I would have totally asked if she had a spare and went on a tree climbing date with her.
I love how this sub is gender less
"My first messages from women are either ""hi"" ""hello"" or ""psst."" Yeah I'm not wasting my time."
[NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....
Not sure....but there's a cream for that.
I'd rather we didn't discuss this kind of stuff here, really. Doesn't feel very useful to any kind of debate. 
I thought that type of camouflage failed horribly because the high contrast and defined shapes made the ships really stand out.
No. Screw him. It IS a demanding job. Physically and emotionally draining. You deserve a hot meal and a friggin hour or two to decompress.
Wow, thanks so much for me to own tool that I can speak and understand Japanese fluently enough.
"""You should be so lucky."" Bonus points if they get confused. "
It‚Äôs ironically calling British people ugly as a meme i guess
2 warm days and we all lose our minds? :)
It was obvious with 5 min left coach [NAME] didn‚Äôt want to win this game
Found the guy who has no idea what's going on! Downvote me all you want, you'll never take my memes!
^ but she ain‚Äôt a traitor
I feel like I already knew, I just needed to have someone else tell me to really open up my eyes. Thank you for your comment
maybe next time you should do some fucking research. prohormones will shut down your test production
Every time I see a something like, 'thanks for nothing, [NAME],' I mentally apologize to her, lol. 
It's interesting that you'd prefer to punish yourself instead of making life easier. I'd do the same with some stuff too
I might not agree with the maduro regime, but t how can BoE justify what amounts to stealing $1.2 billion in gold from Venuzuela? 
Fuuuuuuuuuck that.
Russian prostitutes are overblown. It's not even that common. There isn't really any widespread negative perceptions about [NAME] in South Korea.
Yeah i also like [NAME] now but that gives me a horrible idea. What if we think the same about fortnite later
Wow what a surprise...
This guy gets it...
That's just how to look good in general
"I instinctively thought that meant ""That's gotta hurt"""
Hmm ... Vancouver is not on the list? that's interesting ...
the fucking buffet part killed me, i always considered myself good at roasting but damn bro lmaoo
Considering I‚Äôm majoring in politics, that‚Äôs the plan!!! Thank you! 
We know from experience that [NAME] couldn‚Äôt save a boat
What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!
Great for when you'd really like all your clothes to smell like hard-boiled eggs.
Hmmm. She is Korean. Based on the early posts I didn't see that one coming.
"Can't find it. (I don't mean [NAME] ""weewee weenie"") looking for 90df savage group"
Very. As a side note, what, do they not expect heavy traffic on that bridge? One lane only?
Hello Vietnam?
Yup. You see more hands, have to learn more to be competitive.. etc
My dumb ass thought it was meant to be a magic wand and he was reversing time and I was really confused.
feels like the Leave vote Opposition is falling apart...
Yeah, but the sound of a fork against the stainless would be absolutely unbearable. 
Baby's feeling their look too!
I've been really into reading nonfiction lately and ancient religious history sounds fascinating! Do you have any books you recommend?
Great company. I added it. Let me know if you have any
It's a shame that so many experimental psychology studies are still using such dubious statistical practices.
They only want excuses to run the clock down towards no-deal.
[NAME] i really hate entitled people. Upvote if you think that EPs are worse than Antivaxxers.
the 28% /u/beelzebambi
WW2 has the best supply drops ever
INTJ here, I agree with this ^^^ (Him)
Sorry for the bad analogy, yours is way better
Captain you ARE wrong. You‚Äôre wrong nooption to argue. I have the final rule ! Nope not gonna listen.
It's John Fogerty v Fantasy Records all over again, and the parent comment is Fantasy Records 
Congrats mate.
"[NAME]?! Is that [NAME]? I know ""meegwetch"" means thank you lol"
Be careful with this weed
fake gamer girl didnt know [NAME] is already a rapper
I'm just living through you as you use shower comebacks in real life. Glorious...
My favourite goes back to one of the first battles ever on YouTube:
No passes on skin color or class, yeah right thats why [NAME] is a supreme court justice right ??? 
omg lke ikr
He reminded me more of [NAME] last year. His lumbering skating this year makes him look different.
You must be new! it's TASM around these parts.
Some of us can't do syrup any more. :(
My son isn't old enough to remember his brother and my husband and I feel like that's a blessing.
The ochils are the only plus side to living in Clackmannanshire. Plus easy travel to anywhere in scotland
Does that violate the NAP or not, hmmü§î
At least you went out! For what it's worth, I definitely would have gone out with you if you were near me.
Yeah but even then I feel like they could‚Äôve went about it better
Thx! Happy New Year!
Newcomers have never heard of the flippening ever since :( that‚Äôs sad
And when I thought this sub was gee AF someone says the day with this gold nugget
AKA free to those who can afford it.
You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
Lol u wot m8?
Despite all the [NAME] hate in/on /Melbourne, here is a beautiful Indian song for you all 
I still miss the north hills bottom dollar :(
this comment made me very nervous
I hope it doesn‚Äôt get worse
Who has the skills to turn this into a fight seen? Maybe ninjas or the 7 dwarves
"Adjust your W4. Everyone has to pay taxes, so save it with the ""I have to send a check to the government!"" BS. "
So kind of like the Yellow Vests.
"From what im seeing. ""The democrats can stop this if they just let him build the wall. Its their fault."""
You can't be serious.
Where did they film it?! Is it at real Pine Gap? Love the show, binged first season one eveüòç
Merrily merrily merrily merrily something something scream... (I am not creative)
[NAME] is promised a valyrian steel sword by daenerys, which one will he get? 
Haha the death and suffering here! Haha he had kids! Haha he was a philanthropist! Haha you might be a sociopath.
Owners died. Next of [NAME] has no idea their car is at the airport.
Was that an airbag at your legs/feet area?
If you use one of those two I automatically hate you
{(_Unexpected_error in [{response}] seek technical attention inmediately_)}
Wow full-screen twitch on mobile is cancer.
I wish [NAME] son was older so it be possible he did this.
They showed a pretty cool [NAME] cosplay from a guy
Thanks, I love it.
ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge.
but I love your username
If he has to put up with people like you, I feel even more sorry for him now. Yikes. 
I shed a tear at how beautifully well said this comment was.
They're demonized because they're annoying.
that was an awful open shot....
This made me smile so hard. I am happy for you. May we all find our own happy and worthy constellations üíï
Good point, thank you for the correction
I have more faith in [NAME] than anyone on the court to make a 3. Strange world
#DIRRRKKKK NOWITZKI!!!
Surf Wax America, great song
You haven‚Äôt missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn‚Äôt look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that.
You seem jealous
Interesting, I‚Äôm going to have to pay closer attention. Thanks.
I pray that I won't have to change my clothes.
Tis but a scratch.
> But you will probably find you are noticeably worse looking at 40 than you are at 27. Well that's disappointing.
This is really scary. The saddest about this is i really think it will be possible quite soon. :(
That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.
Hell, I'm saving your Reply. Enjoy being the first in my list!
Who brings a gun to a middle school in the first place? This kid was not right.
So you are projecting to defend your hate. Nice psyche you have there enlightened one
I don‚Äôt think this fits the sub
And that‚Äôs how the mafia works.
Your comment reminds me of that one satirical GTA V radio ad where the advertiser tries to encourage people to beat their kids. It's kinda funny.
Lol you're scared
[NAME] fucking practice and watch some tutorials before fucking up a $100 bottle of French champagne
Why did you expect to feel comfortable? What have you done to change?
In that case the bottom queens would probably not learn the lyrics
Ohhh you're an incel. Your opinion doesn't matter. Back in your hole smeegle
Thats great :) just dont shy away and embrace that you will go down a unique journey.
Definitely very messy. Thank you so much for your advice! Really hoping this works out okay.
That's true, but you see, one man can really make a difference. [NAME] I loved the movie
I know, which is why I said it hasn't been referenced by any *living* characters on the show.
You guys are fools. This is gold.
That was painful to read.
Yeah that's what I just got. Fkin annoying.
This game is pretty drunk.
Also since so many are forgoing children or having fewer the is less needed to purchase very large homes.
Looks like my greyhounds feet
Dont break NC. Bring doggo inside and warn the grandparents. Unless theres a good doggo beach/park nearby then maybe go out instead
Hey, I love you! üòÅ
They're all bad enough to be lumped in to the same category? You either have very high standards, or none at all.
No reason to follow pros casting setting because they pick what is best for themselves. You will find out what is best for you.
This is a hate sub
Cute! And similar coloring to mine. :)
Accounting. I love the work, hate the people and the environment.
Conservatives now hate dancing... anybody surprised?
Imagine if we were that team that was just 1 piece away instead of the team that is 14. üò≠
Pretty
Don't doubt yourself. They're wrong.
He‚Äôs such a little bitch, impossible to like
Praying!!
They said Texas! #Woooooo TEXAS
I'll take these close thru 36 minutes Ls over a loss by 25 and was never in the game Ls
I just wish she could do this on the show more readily
Higher ranking officer? Also, I'm curious, do MP have authority in scenarios like this?
30 Rock is the best. I'm currently on my 1st rewatch of The Office and it's still just as good as I remember it.
People don‚Äôt understand the word allegation anymore, or innocent until proven guilty.
Plz explain the TeamViewer thing. Im interested.
Honestly wish I could do this, I miss my long hair sometimes :(
Thanks! I was probably going to look in the Midwest
I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
I'm just tired of feeling the same way everyday it's really grinding me down, that sucks about your summer school.
But this isnt about a comic book movie. It's a cartoon. Also this is a right wing website...so how does this not count?
Proof of age is reasonable, but having to prove identity to enter is just appalling.
All I've said about that topic is that I support abortion but I think birth control and sterilization are better.
That‚Äôs what we said about 2017 and 2018 after 2016 it only got worse and it‚Äôs not gonna get any better I guarantee
California Adventure has beer so I'm fuckin living the dream.
She isn't disrespectful like [NAME] but she's also a cheater and she's making ridiculous excuses for her cheating
I did too. A shame, because it looks to be a good movie otherwise.
This is a weird thing to be concerned about.
Haha sorry, I make hip hop music üòÇ
Given [NAME] viability prior to the 2016 election, I think the viability bar is set pretty damn low.
I left her off because I tried to keep the list to people who were in a little earlier than her.
Thanks! I've got at least 6 certifications from coursera and a few more from udemy. Good luck to you too!
I live an hour from one but was afraid of driving all the way there and them telling me that I have to order one.
Buddy... Are you ok? Is there a teacher at your school that's strange? Kidding. Nice post as always.
Really Nice chiaroscuro
Sue the shit out of her for damages to your private property.
PLACE THE DEVICE ON HER HEAD HA HA HA TIME TO DIE
I'm not sure how to post a picture lol. Here's my attempt.
Every BP within cooeee of me is consistently 5-10 cents a liter higher than other options. Weird.
I would love to see [NAME] take on the Avengers and win.
In Rainbow is super amazing album as well.
No lie his jumpshot is pretty If he can hit those 3x more in-game, oh my god; [NAME] for [NAME] straight up
"""No thanks"""
I liked it better when [NAME] was half naked
You are the one who wants them to waste away. That is literally your position.
Take your pick bro.
I‚Äôm telling ya, we really need to impose a basic hockey knowledge test to post here. I‚Äôm sick of the mouth breathers.
4. Go out and show [NAME] is still a stud and free agents should want to come here and play with our young core
it's kinda cute
hope he keeps his shit together, he can become great
Missed that, wishful thinking, I was hoping they would team up for a little
Isn't this the same video already posted ? Not seeing anything different
Auch, that's gotta hurt...
Do not come for [NAME].
Paired with all the other trivial things they make you do that have no effect on your job performance, it's just to break your spirit. 
He isn't as big, but he's still quite popular. I've heard the same thing about his content. Never watched him much.
Haha not in those words, but I did say it was dramatic and unreasonable.
Omg like if you read this in 2019üòÇ
Exactly, i've never heard of dutch lessons on school anywhere in the world !?
[NAME] from Always Sunny is literally the best comparison for this dude. He looked a LOT like him and behaved the same way.
Agreed. To add, we also need to see how coaching changes shake out when it's all done.
I forgot i followed this subreddit and now i'm having a meltdown
Reaching parity with Steam's 15 year legacy in a single year would be an amazing effort.
this is too cool
You're so right. I'll remove my arms post haste.
I have a feeling if my car won‚Äôt start my ETL would come and Uber me to work
She must have turned 25 recently
Lol it was worse for them last year
"I love how the reason for the dislocation got progressively less extreme until the ""I was sitting down"" Man, getting old sucks"

Nice post here, dork.
Which one? I like their podcast but I can totally see why a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt hahaha
Saw this on r/teenagers first haha
See him live if you haven‚Äôt already. One of my favorites to see in concert.
"You went to your Xbox? I went to my NES... and it was ""the new thing""!"
16-37 and 25 fta. [NAME] is so fucking overrated. Volume chucker/flopper in a fast paced no defense league.
You can get trough it, it sounds like fucking bullshit, but you can
I have no idea what your post means but I love your name and you are one of us
I didn't realize being in my late 20s qualified me as a senior citizen, where do I get my AARP card?
I was just joking...
Why not both? It would reduce crime. Significantly
Turns out they weren't wrong about [NAME] either
"""Feed the wars and fuck the poors"" is pretty much their policy."
They made this exact post like a month ago, 
They mug you and ruin the country
Nice-full circle! Leaving [NAME] for dust- I love it.
I think the biggest fucking thing is that apparently reaper has a goddamn family himself.
The gov puts the DUP and monkeys in the same figures so it's hard to guess
Just woke up and bull run already started.. loving the üí© show
Rouge Park is federal.
I'D LET HIM VIOLATE MY ASP WITH HIS BATON
Maybe because communism has shown time and time again that it finds humans beings below contempt and makes every effort it can to murderstarve as many as it can..?
Omg! That's awesome thank you so much!
Oh good! Yeah hard to pick up on sarcasm sometimes
And Meteor Man Edit: Hancock was a superhero movie too even though it was terrible.
What did he say?
Haha, love it! :)
The right time would have been never being there in the first place
I run medic all day every day.
So get a job and leave. It's just going to get worse. First the tv then you. Get out while you can
Don't be coy were talking about the active ingredients here not the plant itself.
I think my retinas detached due to the Herculean force of my eye roll. Hail [NAME]!
Yes that's correct, without TWDG no story based game would exist , but i still like LiS
I mean that‚Äôs a stupid rule that creates an echo chamber, but I don‚Äôt see how that belongs here.
How you don't give in to her every whim is amazing to me. You're a much stronger person than me.
...old man
Dear [NAME], please help [NAME] be less disgusting. Amen.
I am not a competent till member, I am an ignorant member of the public. 
wow! trust issues.
I know you're joking, but there are people here either stupid or desperate enough to believe and perpetuate such idiocy. 
[NAME]? Didnt have have lots of problems with injuries. He seems to be doing fine now, scoring and all.. But why him?
‚ÄúBut officer, I have a doctor‚Äôs note saying I *have* to expose myself to them!‚Äù
Game day activities would be my guess. Not positive though.
Yeah it doesn't impact much except when they break and cause billions of dollars in damages and irreparable consequences to the wildlife.
My grandmother-in-law does this. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone in the Va Beach area.
Luckily, everyone regrets MySpace. 
All it takes is a single touch to get me out of my armor and in my underwear?
##EVEN IF YOU DONT WANT TO WATCH IT, GO TO 40:20 AND WATCH FOR 20 SECONDS, I SWEAR TO FUCKING [NAME] YOU WILL LOVE IT
I don‚Äôt know why they bother with it.
Can we just take a minute to appreciate the thigh. So delicious and so cheap.
*walks up to mic* **Wrong** [NAME] is the face of the Democratic Party. There is no other uniting force with enough muster to surmount [NAME]. Puriod
This article is stupid.
Hiroshima is a crime against humanity
I wish I could get a lazy Malinois. I love their look and Mal puppies are so cute! But I‚Äôm not a run-everyday dog owner.
Man, my USDA loan took months to process even when the govt wasn‚Äôt shut down. 
What are you talking about, there was an update this week. And even then 3 weeks is not enough for a huge update
And you got it, a federal tax cut. If you want to pay less taxes overall you need to stop electing democrats.

If she was in that mode, why would this guy even be in consideration for a Super Bowl date? 
Where exactly is the irony? His name is not [NAME], and the title, bio, and picture contain no related jokes. 
Always take a chance on the dork. We rock in general l. There are a few weirdos hut by and large dorks have it together.
How stupid are you, if you dont r√©alize it‚Äôs staged

Thank fucking [NAME].
Wow such a story! This is great art. Can I find more stuff like this somewhere?
Always funny how one's income has to pay for others expensive lifestyles ;)
Salt lake, Utah. No joke, Utah has the highest rate of plastic surgery than anywhere else in the US.
yikes i thought it was just a joke transformer [NAME]
Curious as to why he's been passed up so many times now.
You think only a -couple- people use fgt hatefully?
That might‚Äôve been the worst pass he‚Äôs ever thrown. Yikes
[NAME] looking good for a big game
Pretty much yeah, it‚Äôs crazy that 2 years later that someone picked 56 picks later is better as a player
Let's get skinner locked up for 8 years first. Don't want to upset him before he signs
I have a shirt with a picture that is very similar to this
Well shit, then it's just like [NAME] wouldn't let me complete a maths degree just because I'm ideologically opposed to this 'algebra' thing!

Indescribably beautiful.
No link sharing the pics? Mildly disappointed in reddit haha
I‚Äôm always weirded out whenever I see him without a beard because in my game I got the longest beard I could
I schedule reading breaks during the day. It allows me time to relax if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, but is still beneficial for the kids. 
That's what happens when you're high.
Thanks I hate it. Also I've been spontaneously diagnosed with stage 3 cancer throughout my entire body dude watching this video. I start chemotherapy on Monday
That‚Äôs what I was thinking as well. I could think of a few ways to go about restoring a painting but not on a wall. Lol
Tell... what? I‚Äôm confused.
Now were talking. Acknowledge our short comings and bring in a guy that is essentially a solution to most of them. Love it.
[NAME] did it first!
FTFY* Fixed that for you

I'm glad that yours is getting slightly better too! Keep on working on it and you'll be a social butterfly someday!
Well I did add an edit you might have missed haha

How did U quit being obsessed? It‚Äôs my goal for 2019.

Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy

They had courts. You sue people who wronged you.
Its the same at my place, not that anyone cares... Netherlands btw
I'm in production in manufacturing.
Lol I don‚Äôt disagree, but the perimeter defense let them walk into the paint. You can blame [NAME] too.
No, you're stupid. Pronoun confusion is a side effect.
But it‚Äôs so hideous
The other person was [NAME] on Hell's Kitchen. Shot herself in 2007.
You're right, that's a solid advice. I will give it some time and if I am unhappy I will start distancing myself. Thanks!

Also, money. It is a cost-prohibitive procedure for many who desire one.
Oh! Thank you!

Or minor son - this news is about two female chiefs being accused of molesting two male trainees.
Doctor charged 400 bucks for a blood pressure check before renewing my wife's high BP medication. She HAS been acting a little weird la

look how the Islanders didn't let us get a good shot there do that devils defense
Strongly agree, [NAME] and [NAME] have been outplaying him for about a month. He's about dead even with [NAME] right now too.

Things did not go well on Eros Station...
And how is that the responsibility of [NAME]? Did he tell people to go after the family's?
That‚Äôs not a very humble opinion at all.
I do. The only thing I never understand was why it happened in that time.
I know we were all thinking it. I‚Äôm supposed to be a leader so all you sheeple better follow me!
Lol what can you even say you meant to say? ‚ÄúSorry auto correct meant let‚Äôs do SOCKS‚Äù.
I love flying out of Midway because I feel like I have never waited more than 10 minutes for security. I love the lines at Midway.
Black Twitter has a higher IQ.
All the time, you just sort of accept it round here. Butt-hurt mombies and bitter regretful daddicts are what I usually chalk it up to.
Been spot on so far.
I feel you. It's weird that we don't see [NAME] or [NAME] in the promotional stuff though.
And the fact that the reason he was sitting on my

[NAME]. i love it
No offense to pop, but their record suggests that they haven't been able to stop enough momentum this year.

It‚Äôs always easier for TIMs to walk around with their ‚Äútiddies‚Äù out. They‚Äôve never been shamed for them.
It‚Äôs way too broken, anyone and their dog can use it.
This interview has so much gold in it. The Wreck it Ralph bit is my favourite.
A guy that size could very easily kill a petite woman with a direct punch
Nerves? If he knows you well enough, he will understand?
Stalking is kind of beta. He should have kidnapped her on horseback.
Same here! I was addicted to her and beaus stories during their trip to Europe right before filming this season. They are the best!

I have a good feeling about the ability to be a left handed gunslinger.. please Rockstar :(
Do you feel better now?

Do you have any tinder picture or bio advice? I have no selfies or mirror pics but still not doing very well
Thank you :)

Correct, you eat to survive, but you you eat animals for pleasure.
Same. After that it‚Äôs unbearable. Plus, [NAME] appears. So.

Self-deprecating humor is mainstream now. A lot of hot people now have hobbies and personality traits that were once almost synonymous with dumpy/nerdy/ugly people.

My only regret will be posting this on my alt account.

Oh that's actually really interesting. So IQ of the general population would be a bell curve by definition?
Don‚Äôt forget sports gambling. THEN we‚Äôll be happy.
It actually makes me really happy when people literally call me [NAME]. Thanks kind stranger!
I've honestly looked at mine and thought, I wonder if it'd keep my cup of coffee hot.
If I don't shave I won't be able to wear a bikini, so not shaving is not an option

No. The Office wouldn't exist today due to liberalism and everyone being offended for everyone else.
On-court obnoxiousness should be punished and has nothing to do with the game of playing tennis. Bring your A game hitting the ball or walk off the field.
Tag a friend who wakes up sexually horny
What is he doing here without [NAME]?!
And in adult spaces in general. Let adults have things to themselves, damn it
Just think of the awesome stories though!
already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame.
"I'll pass the ""I'm not crying you're crying!"" part. Yeah I'm crying. "
It's a close one. I'm going to agree with you because look what happens when [NAME] goes down.
I always compared him to [NAME].
I didn't see it either! I feel like the kid at the birthday party that didn't get a piece of cake...
"You can buy the full ""girlfriend experience"" with a hooker for way less than 13k lmao."
Yeah, think there's only about 100k of them. Can certainly say I don't know of any besides [NAME].
Reach out to @teamyoutube on twitter and explain what is going on.
Phew!!
This sounds like revenge, not karma.
For some reason I wanted to be a bartender when I was 8. After hearing this story, makes me feel I missed out. 
Okay, cool. Thanks.
This is objectively wrong, what the actual fuck lol.
Let's do it (if done smartly by SK) NK wants to go the path of Vietnam in how they developed
I have always loved [NAME], love the deadpan humor of him and peavis, and he's just a talented and amusing guy.
The commies will be much less sympathetic if they get the chance.
Oh [NAME] it's [NAME] against dinosaurs again
[NAME] looks queasy already I like where this is going
^ I find both creepy tbh.
What an amazing comment!This really resonates with me! Thanks for writing.
Other than the [NAME] storyline and the flashbacks the stories building up to the main villain went in circles. Wasn‚Äôt anything exciting or to interesting.
... the eagle was chosen as the emblem of US in 1782. How are your timelines this messed up?
I live in the South, lol, and this is really accurate.
If he's mailing you cash, and you're waiting to ship the item until payment is received, i'm confused how this would be a scam.
I feel digestive regret just looking at them.
He doesn't really fit, he is more of a mid range shooter. Plus we already have to many players at power forward who are better.
Thanks for the gold
[NAME] has a fun instagram
If I were her I would've opened the car door and properly petted the obviously good boy
I appreciate the dedication, but they really didn't have to be silent for three quarters of the game.
Looks extra creepy in light of the recent revelations about his campaign.
She‚Äôs still not gonna message you dude I promise
I know, all the comments have me cracking up.
Pls no, it's too cold outside to go hatless.
Moving in general sucks, moving a book store must really suck
I‚Äôd like to add that it‚Äôs British slang. We also use ‚Äòkiddy fiddler‚Äô.
Lmao, I remember [NAME] saying this was the best game he'd ever played and was debating whether he should switch from HS.
People on the internet take shows too seriously. The average fan is not like that
I laugh, but I genuinely believed this until I was 8 or so.
You are correct.

Megatron hanging out with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. This is like a fever dream
Damn didn‚Äôt know it was for a whole now that‚Äôs crazy
[NAME] is so weak. What a ballerina he is around the basket.
Of course you can. We have the freedom to choose *who* exploits us, but not whether or not we are exploited.
The content is a rambling mess.
He‚Äôs always ready
Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
>You're splitting hairs. Owning something vs having something on loan for however long the owner lets you have it is not splitting hairs.
They are used to semis surely
Thanks for sharing! I can so see me taking the scraps when he inevitably is having a good day and reaches out. I will resist!
No wonder they don‚Äôt want us using the word ‚Äúretarded‚Äù...it all makes sense now
What? I‚Äôm not downvoting anything. I feel like you‚Äôre coming off a little whiny and paranoid right now... please calm
Reminds me of [NAME] saying ‚ÄúCow House‚Äù in Breaking Bad.
I love this!!! You got it!
Your comment reminded me of this
Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
I never went back to the post to see if it was BOA, but I‚Äôm not surprised if it was. That was my first guess. 
DONT DO IT PRELLER
Cuba's great. There's shredded pork everywhere
But it flattens the whole thing out.
Not quite no. I don't pay attention to the leaks so I can't judge their quality.
Their interests are convergent where it matters: they *all* want more of your money to go to healthcare.
Ah, modern society's obsession with romance for the sake of romance‚Ä¶ I hate it.
Sadly, yes. You'll only be able to craft weapons with fixed Attachements.
Looks like wood. Could be wrong.

I keep seeing you around and I love the art. I really want to get into drawing but I‚Äôm only good ad heads and faces.
Theres not really any structure or composition to this. The color scheme is tight but it's just kind of thrown on there without any direction.
Love this answer.
Who was it saying that [NAME] destroys hooker and broner again
It goes a long way to explaining American mental health issues. Have you ever bothered to read anything?
now that you say it, i can't unsee it...

Don't live near Chicago but still have my winner from the Dec 21 game. Hope I can still use it when I'm back on the 27th.
I don‚Äôt think that many people really thought [NAME] would be a game changer.
Man, never underestimate the power of a crock pot, some frozen chicken, veggies and cottage cheese.
"Each Dark Souls game has been voted ""Most Likely to Result in Controller Damage""."
"*[NAME] misses his spot* ""GAATT"" in case u dont know what im talking about"
This is wack
I feel like that‚Äôs the least disgusting option. Imagine a penis or vaginal canal made out of fingers.
Why would anyone forget how dominant he is? Lmao Oh yea we suck.
You will also be removed from a jury if you utter anything about it.
Well that Praying Mantis had some balls. Just imagine this tiny little dude said a prayer and then jumped right in to fight this giant.
I was actually introduced to hbomb and breadtube in general Becuase of [NAME] vid on ds2. So thanks [NAME]?
I have soo many questions!
I punch them in the throat before they get the chance to speak.
I hope that's a bug because it looks downright embarrassingly bad
This hurts my brain
I‚Äôm embarrassed how long it took for me to figure this out. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm mad at the process and happy with the results for Thrill tonight.
Any differing opinion that exists is heresy.
Excellent. [NAME] ([NAME] in particular) made me discover my love for DXM and other even weirder dex sounds.
[NAME] loves (the taste of) people
So are we tanking or are we still trying for playoffs?
No offense but you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Maybe you like neurotic, needy men, but the general populace does not.
For religious folks, good and beneficial stuff that happens is always sent by [NAME]. Bad stuff... The [NAME] works in mysterious ways.
Yeah im sure the chinaman who made this in his tiny noodle house for one millionth of a yuan is super stoked about this.
That was something I was told as well. It makes sense. Thanks for verifying that as an option.
That's a pretty laughable response. Pretty r/iamverybadass actually.
Pretty good, but I would put the bishop on B4 so that the Knight will be in danger of the queen after taking the bishop.
She said in the ama she prefers they to he when out of drag but is ok with both
What a legend
It took me a second to distinguish between whether it was [NAME] or [NAME]. I have officially been cursed by this subreddit.
Aye but happy cake day mate.
He looks like bob saget
AHAHA I‚Äôd love that dream but replace him With [NAME] üòÇ or Arizona 
Because you‚Äôre insecure with double standards, got it.

HALLELUJAH!!!! YOUVE SEEN THE LIGHT!!!!
>[NAME] No thanks
I got sucked right back into the vicious cycle of love-bombing, gas-lighting and degradation.
Kill em with kindness, as they say
Say you ate something or say things they cannot measure.
Thank you for your reply. It gives me hope, and I will your previous post in a bit.
The government won't let scientists do studies on it, so we're stuck with anecdata until they stop being assholes.
I'm happy however those two don't get a ring. Would be overjoyed if it was at the hands of [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME].
Not possible? Not that I‚Äôve heard of at least.
Happy B'day for Thursday!
What interests do you have?
You haven't presented a reason to not care.
Why was it changed to that? An overreaction. Why is it still like that? Laziness or incompetence, take your pick. Edit: clarity
26>27 confirmed
Everyone knows he's not a spy. He's a pawn. Russia want him to swap for their actual spy, currently talking to [NAME]. 
I‚Äôm not frustrated... i think I was trying to be nice.. but now I‚Äôm confused and awkward. My apologies
That gives you zero right or say over what someone wears. You are wrong.
Same. She seems to get aggravated more easily now too. Hope it's just the political climate and not the tail end of her prime.
Probably. I am surprised Reddit doesn't just purge all right leaning subs.
Haha I didnt even notice. I guess it does.
Wait, he‚Äôs not actually saying that? ü§Ø I must‚Äôve crafted my post with too much... SUBTLETY.
> Nothing mentioned about him thinking to transfer. That's what this whole thread is about, dork.
thank you so much! :)
*Patiently awaits AFL*
No you don't. The average opinion of ISIS for example is way below zero.
Good luck to [NAME] if he really thinks he can take over the country with the most armed citizens. Trump derangement syndrome is real.
I see this as a guy making fun of a small sect of women, not a bitter jab at all as a whole
When my mom yells at me like that is because she loves me though, she should learn something from this
Dallas should feel absolutely horrible this is a 1 goal game given how patheticallly bad the Devils are tonight.

I unironically approve of this message. It is time for the French Revolution to end.
Yah that's what is stopping me. I would have to wire all throw my car or go into my cars electrical which doesn't seem worth it.
It doesn't add up that a person who was receiving threats took actions to stop receiving threats?

Your pedo-tache is only the fourth worst thing about your face.
I hope [NAME] at least showers before his funeral.
She just likes to fight, don‚Äôt worry about her. She crazy! 
No, it's just that OP made that part up. The article didn't say anything about femenists.
[NAME] has really given his all in the second half. He must be exhausted
That's amazing why have I never found this before.
It's so goddamn funny.
It's a really bad attempt to get attention and make people mad, that everyone in this thread has decided to indulge.
I remember reading this on a rage comic site 7 years ago hahaha!
Yeeesss...... let the anger flow through you...
He‚Äôs also got a girlfriend that he really seems to care about....
Disinfected or sanitized maybe. No way an entire exam table is sterilized.
Made me laugh, tbh.

Gotta love [NAME].
She does, they are best friends.
Most kids progress from dishy but I'm not sure about this one. Seems a bit slow and very very nasty when others offer advice
I think they were talking about the learning proccess. [NAME] succeded as well. So, 3 of them.
that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.
Good luck, I hope you find it really easy! I did, and I‚Äôve never looked back :)
Hit up skull forts if you are looking for the fastest way. But just play and have fun.
Reddit I‚Äôm blind, what‚Äôs the bottom right?
In this view, you claim to wield power over them, and are clearly no anarchist. You are implicitly advocating for hierarchy.
lol, I thought he might have been heading towards that direction with that too.
Personally, I would be able to look past it since you weren‚Äôt the one married. 
Oh [NAME]. But I'm sort of confused as to how the pic was taken, sorry if you said it but I'm a bit stupid and tired
Crazy stuff! Gets 80% to shatter before taking any damage. That positioning is on point!

AYY! Anti-Semitism! Didn't expect that from AnCaps, but I'm not surprised.
I ended up with my kneecap dislocated like that back in the 80‚Äôs (it was a tragic hackysack accident). 12/10 would not recommend.
Reads like a movie script to me.
I like that they have a red light camera there to combat the red light runners. You can see it flash twice at 0:48.
In Soviet USA, the simple minded twit who finds himself in all sorts of adventures IS the president.
OMG my [NAME] hates it too but she does it to me all the time
They need to practice intuitive feeling and depression acceptance.
Yes, you should speak with an attorney.
Yeah, I feel like Velvet Underground is the band of choice for 20 year olds 
He gets paid to hate them... what's hard to understand?
Those are pretty good points. Not just for a hypothetical argument, but just good points about the plot in general.

Dude it was an old video. Your porn math is way off.
Thanks for the help.
Real nice, swearing up a storm right in front of your kids.
To be fair the lore is so nonexistent other than on Ubi‚Äôs site you could probably just pretend that‚Äôs the case anyways.
stepped over that dude like he was [NAME]!
[NAME] looks like one of the best bigs in the league when he plays like this
I really hope that's true and really hope they grow some balls and ban it.
Me too. For some reason, even the people that I know that love reading don't read Murakami. I love that lil Japanese man. 
[NAME] is amazing how dare you
Love both flags man! I was on my college campus today in my old Thrashers hat while wearing my Jets sweatshirt. Go Jets! Have fun!
Good luck OP! I'm rooting for you!
Why is the waitress posting here?
break them. join the fight, stop fighting against the fight.
And people have the audacity to ask me what‚Äôs special about this series.
You fucking got this bb, one step at a time. The DD is here for you.
I guess I can see how someone thousands of miles away would say that, but its far from the truth.
[NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder.
You most likely went through foster to adopt. Private adoptions are insanely expensive. Insanely. But, you probably knew that if you actually did adopt.
Oh wow- some truly have crazy different genetics. I‚Äôm glad you got her a friend, I‚Äôm sure it helps immensely. 
Your heart stopping is technically a natural cause.
Yo gg man I was the lobby
I thought it was known they bought those 2 seats. It was a big deal for solar at the time.
You‚Äôve done us a good service
That makes perfect sense! Thank you for explaining in a way that doesn't try to make me feel stupid for not knowing the answer.
Thanks for the information!
That's true deep voices are sexy.
You don't get it man
Good advice thank you I appreciate it. I need to learn to focus my mind again
>muh siege Screw off, if I wanted to listen to some [NAME] ramblings I'd go to my local range.
They sure look the part...
OW MY LEG!
That man was an amazing speaker, even these three minutes are enough to show that.
Thanks. I didn't quite get it from the original. Appreciate the time.
Nothing should be off limits.
Haha yeah!
100%! Congrats on your job too!
Poor critter D:
here‚Äôs hoping the same is true for me!
pretty ironic this was recorded
aren't women supposedly great at multitasking?
I had to look those up.lol. That's awesome. Do you make money by doing so or just pure hobby?
I can‚Äôt work, wish I could. Worked hard my whole life and lost literally everything a few years ago. 20 years down the drain.
Can someone like link me to the picture i‚Äôve been trying to find it
Tell us your story, too, [NAME] :) Sooooo many more details to mine, ooooofffff... i tried to be brief
Omg does anyone have a video of this
I really hope your marriage is healed and can become stronger than ever.
Fuck that. Anyone who makes a career out of spreading bullshit to morons is worthless trash.
Sorry, every time I try a link post my post fails, I‚Äôm just doing a text post. 
I am sorry for making fun of your username, I sincerely apologize.
Oh man, sorry to hear you‚Äôre feeling so alone. I‚Äôm feeling the same right now. 
Time to get new friends. This one clearly doesn‚Äôt appreciate you for who you are.
Omg they are adding audio???!! Epic really loves to cater to the sweats
I can't see anything wrong with this message
While I have no experience in dating/relationships, I have been through unrequited love. So I learnt that the hard way
I had some pretty bad diarrhea right after the game. It's was more enjoyable than that loss.
Get [NAME] back on the wing. Looks awful in this position
then its lost man. So sad!...its terrible
And that wig is awful
My 2 best girls in the series combined into one and [NAME] with [NAME] colors is so beautiful :)
>looses his shit
Debating whether this is a troll or gross overshare. Going to go with troll since you just also made a new account
Yes girl preach
Ooooooo that burns!!! üî•üî• ü§£ This is amazing.
"I can't stop staring at ""[NAME]"". "
he knows there are tribute bands, right?...
That's it. I use a puff but my BF won't, so I'm always buying body wash for him about 3x as often. 
Large McDonalds fry üôà
Epic didn‚Äôt take the rights, Skybound chose to work with them. Blame Skybound not epic.
A surprise to no one. Absolute stud.
I'm not sure I have heard of this. Really interesting.
We had a baby, it's hard to find the time to take them down.
Hey, we all love South Park friend.
Typical [NAME], i know because i am one
Always look to the odd years brother.
Wyrmwood was extremely my shit and I loved every second of it.
I commented like 5 mins b4 you lmao
If you want any hope of getting better, you must stop everything and anything with underage girls...forever 
Someone who wants to drink like half a pint of Jim Beam, that's who!
Oh easy leader of the free world
Haha, willing to sacrifice eternal paradise for a taco. I'd make that trade, straight across..at least the taco is real ='D
Ah thanks so much
Liberal Grandma best Grandma.
i was expecting a kitty
Blizzard was working with Activision long before Hots. I'm afraid its too late now, to divorce.
I mean everyone already knows what u like so its gonna be weird
Also, he never gets hurt so you can't Robidas the guy. 
Awesome! Hope you had a good holiday
which he has now admitted was an error in hindsight and is encouraging JT publically to ban them
Me too! I got scared that I've been laundry inpaired my whole life and never even realized it!
Looking good boah
I'll definelty look into this, thank you for the advice and kind words :) 
Why have you linked a random wiki article? I don't understand your point? What are you trying to claim?
The cringe is just beautiful
Ok why did you bother responding then. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I'm in Printer's Row, but I do have a car so I might just go check it out. Thanks!
It‚Äôs fine. Baby boomers are always angry
Whaaat. I liked Season 8 [NAME]. I wish the whole love arc between him and [NAME] had never been a thing, but I liked [NAME]. 
I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.
I want to hug both of them.
"""PPG Paints"" arena or whatever it's called now is worse"
They will. The White House gave credit yeste day to Russia and Syria and saod they will finish the fight against ISIL.
Errrrr a lot of those houses don‚Äôt look like they belonged to people who had servants, so the laundry mom theory stacks up a bit better!
It‚Äôs broken garbage. The most broken unbalanced tekken game by so much it will make your eyes bleed and give you a brain tumor.
He was replying to boiledchickenleg down below by the looks of it.
I'm expressing my distaste at the absurdity of being an internet outrage hero and hypocritical selective outrage, especially in an area such as black music.
I'm starting to think im being rased by narcissists lmao
Canada can't rely on US at the moment, so they'll have to hold out until the next president. 
And trying to take [NAME] gun away. üò© Like really people, it's his weapon, find yourself one and stop trying to teach him better
I feel like the world just doesn‚Äôt want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :‚Äô(
Lol of course its a religion you stoopid carnist. True vegans pray to [NAME] every morning at 5:00 and have to face his direction while doing so.
All the centrist liberals in the comments are furious...
The fact that big corporations that made their successes off capitalism are embracing Marxism is really disturbing.
It's a joke, fam.
The first sentence alone sums it all up üòÇ
Killing goblins is not murder hoboing. [NAME] should have done that himself, really. 
I love this game but even I'm not spending money till some of the bugs are fixed
Hmm okay, maybe I was just arriving at threads too early or something before they got cleaned up...
Admin is all over it!
It's also had derogatory meaning for nearly 400 years. people with any common sense or taste will generally choose *any* other word.
I realize that‚Äôs the joke and I want to know what‚Äôs funny about it
fat people want to be oppressed so badly. I guess it's because they need an excuse to emotionally eat.
omg, poor little bean 
[NAME] got lucky that wasnt a foul on him again
Oh man, glad I'm not watching this with my extremely emetophobic mother 
Good trade yesterday and happy with the front office, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it‚Äôs gone 
This.. im sorry but this is a dumb reply. Ofc it was fake kindness golly
Haha wait why does this sounds so familiar
They got bored from haunting earth for thousands of years and ultimately moved on to the afterlife.
I don't know why, but the thought of that hat on smoke makes me smile...
Women don't want their own shit. They want our shit. ---- [NAME]
Until the Brexiteers bit at the end you could have been talking about Ireland.
Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too
I laughed at this...I think it was the voice I read it in my head with...
Get out now!
You're making me look bad [NAME], while she yells and screams.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs petty revenge. It may have been petty to take a bit of enjoyment in it, but she made her own bed
I assume so, in some form. I also hope they show us more up close of their big city as barely shown in some episode I forget. 
What's wrong with that? [NAME] scandal is funny but not something to focus on in 2020.
Yes but what other sources are there?
Hahahah Someone rmb this joker from movie!
"I'm going to use ""my dicky has to perpetually get sticky"" as a line to pick up ladies. Wish me luck, guys!"
Awesome, thank you! :)
Sort of a joke, but there are many reasons. DW says engineer jokes are not funny.
Wait... dogs can‚Äôt use ladders!
Be patient. Post intelligent and thoughtful comments on others‚Äô posts and it shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few days or a week at most.
[NAME] YES!!!
I appreciate this post, so it‚Äôs appropriate in my eyes üòÄ
Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit
This is the full-circle EP story I came here for. Made my morning. Thanks Aunt [NAME]!
Does this remind anyone else of the Rublev USO17 QF? [NAME] is obviously further along than [NAME] but you can't argue against the results...
He qualified for the winter skirmish which was top 200 out of millions who tried.
Verisimilitude, which here means, utter bs meant to help justify terrible favouritism.
Amended: skip all intros AFTER THE FIRST TIME. I actually want to see them... ONCE. That said: pressing a button ain't no hassle.
supernova AOC <3, the lies the media gets away with. Glad someone is talking back with real umph
>Ordinary Men by [NAME] Thanks for the recommendation. Got it ordered on kindle from Amazon.
Was just wondering about the mobile thing. I only use mobile and I've never noticed anything odd. It's not something people would care about anyhow.
Like idgaf if it‚Äôs fortnite themed I need those in my life again
I‚Äôve always heard that the two people you *never* hook up with are exes and roommates. That‚Äôs the only bad sounding part of this.
should've rolled into battle with a sword brad. that would have fuckin' rocked
For those interested in the reference:
They also manually deleted Mumkey Jones channel for no reason.
Well they never got into metal. Get over yourself and get a lot safer in the comments.
Heels are fucking hot. Do you like the crop used on you, him, or both?
Is it that confusing to understand a food layerd with meat chees pasta aand sos we call lasagna
This was not only true, but pleasing to watch.
I'm just reminding everyone. you're not helping the situation by being pedantic
Argh. The most stupid and needless abuse of power teachers do. Some particularly stupid ones at least.
I had that moment of ‚Äúwait, am I the narcissist‚Äù too! Thankfully, like you said, time & distance cleared that up. 
I gave undeliverable perishables to a local fire department before
It would have been more believable if he stated he was attacked by penguins wearing red hats.
Seriously! I'm on Xbox and all my crew and we have never had an issue!
Yeah, that will reduce the number of kids taking pills - make enjoying a drink at a festival even more difficult!
[NAME] what's your opinion on this?
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing lol but it‚Äôs one of my favorite maps and blood isn‚Äôt up to snuff with it
"""[NAME] could drown in a glass of water."" LOL. i actually love [NAME], though. i know i'm in the minority."
oh I get it now. Forget I said anything
I never said it was irrelevant. I am trying to add on to what the OP had said for potential savings.
Minor character but I love [NAME].
Oooff I really hope this doesn't happen üò∞üò®üò∞
Can‚Äôt be worse than last week
You elect [NAME], you get what you vote for, Utah. Congratulations, you got what you voted for. Vote smarter next time.
I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.
sometimes i look up at the stars and i wonder if [NAME] is masterbating to our conversation somewhere out there
Whoa, watch out everyone, Mr. Moneybags over here with 20 pairs of smart wool 
So $0.50 for that GIF? I think I'll pass.
And this video has been around more than [NAME].
Both Islanders goaltenders support [NAME] and they are having career years, coincidence? I think not. 
Happy Daily Peko #270! Source couldn‚Äôt be found I think it‚Äôs from the manga.
same, if you breath oxygen you only deserve to get shot and raped.
Thanks. I'll be phoning the psych tomorrow (maybe) about med increase since I'm on the lowest anyways.
Second this. You can cycle along Maribyrnong river for most of it which is pretty relaxing. Fast and healthy too.
I always seem to date men with long hair and a beard. Often with blue eyes.
Should be coming this year with MW4. It's now or never
Intresting. Well I sure did learn something today! Cheers!
Uncle [NAME], you dirty old man.
>overt racism of that level would not be tolerated in America My thoughts also. That's why i needed context, its very VERY odd.
Come to butthead [NAME]
Let me guess, are you Swedish perhaps ? 
Obviously not real but damn i wish it was.
You're naive if you think they won't balance it out somehow in the future.
Probably therapy.
My husband gets very prudish anytime kids are anywhere. EVEN in our locked bedroom.
Then you should probably get out more.
Wouldn't that be the western sky? Also very beautiful pic, OP.
[NAME] believe in evolution and the hat isn't racist just because you say so. Quit trolling.
Now let's see the samples!
Sounds awesome, but I am so out of practice I'd be embarrassed to show up lol.
I didn't even think about counselors or talking to my obgyn. That's a great idea! I really appreciate the advice and encouragement :)
Haha this the best [NAME] answer to this question. Right to the point. <3
How sad that you think because [NAME] wants something we should no longer want it. Grow up you child. Life does not revolve around you or [NAME].
I wouldn't let a sweet potato dictate decisions, ever.
I can‚Äôt see her cheeks...wait a min. Oh those cheeks!!
oh yeah? what if i can't read at all?
That is profoundly messed up.
books are good
Sure! You had my curiosity; now you have my attention...
it‚Äôs happened before?! love my hometown of beautiful new ken üòÇüòÇ
If you think this is bad, you should've seen him at four.
I don‚Äôt get it :(
Such a [NAME] thing to do. Next thing we know he will speculate that [NAME] and [NAME] will sign by February 31st at the latest.
you deserve love too
Look at the quality of that animation on the spider legs. This goes to show that the Simpsons really used to go way beyond the call of duty
Florida. I moved up here and chose the best hockey team in NY/the universe
ah, if only i could hug a beautiful and understanding woman and cry all my depression around her neck.
Funny that you name her when shes one of the only judges that uses her brain and ethics to make decisions.
I hadn‚Äôt seen it and appreciated it!
So that‚Äôs why all of the lab work I get takes so long....
Is this from ‚ÄúPlease Like Me‚Äù? I loved that show. The last season had me in tears though. Really hard to watch. üò¢
I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. I hope the therapy brings you back your husband.
genuinely surprised me, 0
That has to be the saddest nba account ever. Like 4 likes every post :(
Faces covered up.... hmmmm
I was just in shock when she answered the door for devoin.
I'm not going to look at your evidence. There's never been a shred of evidence!
I laughed at this
Yes but the way she does so at the moment, with makeup and bracelets are a bit uncomfortable for her, she says
Yeah this angle is nauseating.
He looks like a Loony Toons character
That‚Äôs on Canada. Sorry but I gotta give credit where credits due
You grew up in America. Your culture was teaching your children to think and fight for themselves.
sometimes it feels like a lot of characters are like that, but only when I fight them
No problem, it warms my heart to help slower people understand things.
Well reality exists therefore [NAME] is reality. Checkmate, atheist.
Oh wow, hate that. 
No my point to using the article is to call out the political theatre and dishonesty of some of our elected officials, mostly in the democratic party.
I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less than those deplorable traitorous trumptards.
Totally. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was my dream until it happened.
He happily accepts the hugs. He hugs me now and again. He also has no problem accepting hugs from his mum.
Ok, thank you and thanks for the LPT. Cold leftover food is great sometimes like cold pizza, cold meatballs, etc...
You have to have a high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
Ha ha ha, thank you so much, he is a total gentleman. Ok, bull by the horns time!
It‚Äôs my favorite Saturday movie, never gets boring
Yea this past season her outfits were horrid
OK it should be 4 week Med Cert then 3 month Med Certs for Jobseeker Support with Medical Deferral, the Doctor can electronically send the forms thru to WINZ. 
The saddest thing about this is that most people truly in need are the last ones to ask for help because they don't want to be anyones burden...
No disadvantages in stereotypes.
Great picture! What a amazing tribute! I love Dallas
She'll probably never be seen again, I fear. Thanks for reminding me of her name.
I don't need to have [NAME] as my husbando to love my mom
I saw a story last month about a lady who was so big she killed her boyfriend with her fat or something. I think that's their plan.
You got any more of that weed?
I've had a crown and bracelets made for me with old ad. Glad I'm not alone
I'm not looking for pity or sorrow. Thanks for your input.
I like the reference to the Good Place :)
lmao i love this!
Doesnt help [NAME] was right. That would further push [NAME] into his arms
Happy birthday [NAME]!
[NAME] to the Fox lady: ‚Äúmy record vs you would be 7-0‚Äù
[NAME] you‚Äôre such a shill for this FO it isn‚Äôt even funny anymore
I think a lot of it's projection. Many incels say they are proud of being NEET.
Because the people pushing the myth are either willfully ignorant or outright malicious.
Frinkiac not working for you?
Oh my god [NAME]
Careful - that shit can get you thrown in jail.
Dude that was in like October abandon all hope
Ah yes that makes sense - the gofundme for her and the workers seems to be taking off at least (if it‚Äôs legit)
I bet you are. Btw, wtf is PNW so next time I'm there I'll know to hit you up
Nah they did a good job. It appears you‚Äôre very mentally unwell, I hope you get better.
Until you see another one you like lol
Great way to be late on 80% of your orders. I mean I didn't say it was impossible, but you put rating at risk
She was 100% more likable on the tell-all than she was in the show. She may deserve that sweet husband of hers yet!
You are the worst kind of person, but i love it
Crosspost from same community?
He‚Äôs been in power for years and gays being murdered in Chechnya isn‚Äôt new.
What a gift!
The human species is more intelligent and sentient than any other animal species that's why.
It's real and it plays SO OFTEN I CAN'T STAND IT!!
are you tagging them as your #WCW? if not, you should start
Yeah I guess in perspective it really isn't a big number at all.
That's a fantastic reply! Thanks.
Wet dreams don't count
How did [NAME] shave her hair with just scissors
So [NAME] guided the process of canonization but then left?
wow that‚Äôs really some hate there. I hated [NAME] in the Office too, but he got okay since the third run
Could Unity not sue the author for giving instructions on how to illegally obtain their product?
Dude, let‚Äôs just offer them a choice between remaining and staying. Democracy, lmao.
This makes me feel better about some of my poor decisions.
Cloning shouldnt recreate sensitivity to the Force.
An angry old person yelling at a retail worker will never listen to reason.
Would love to get my hands on a dia de los muertos.
To be fair all those things actually help prevent/alleviate depression. Smelling like flowers doesn‚Äôt turn you into a woman.
Yes, that's an interesting thing that I've been curious about ever since the merger. And the new party has pretty much purged the Wildrosers.
If everybody put down their camera to help, what would you be doing right now?
That doesn‚Äôt even look like her! Except the [NAME] in the background, now that‚Äôs the one we know and love.
Not gonna lie sometimes I crave meatloaf...
[NAME] Almighty. This may be the most empathetic and compassionate reddit thread I've ever seen! Who ever said drunks were mean? Terrible stereotype.
>who can shoot a gun accurately I too can pull shit out of my ass
Lmao I'm sorry!
Never will happen because of abortion legality. Party/religion over country
[NAME] is a bitch
Yeah. Why throw a wrench into a handy conviction?
What a journey.
Pew pew pew.. gotcha!
What a useless answer in this situation
To be fair he probably is saying that.
What you mean you weren‚Äôt looking forward to that scene? ;)
Way to go!! Thats something I hope to be able to do some time in my life again.
Appreciate the update, hope this one is the right one though ! 
Crazy how [NAME] put out his first album at the tender age of 1
Open a ticket and wait. These next two weeks will be very telling. All we can do is wait.
That was me a lot before I accepted myself as Trans
Now that is a special kind of stupid.
Sorry, no legal advice, but that really sucks and you have my sympathy. Best of luck and determination.
I would say love is never enough. Love is unconditional. Relationships are not.
>More so because a thinking person cannot legitimately argue against it. Man.
Tbh, that sounds better than lithium
I understand doing more coke if you‚Äôre addicted to it but when you mix it with hiv you are officially mentally deranged (crazy)
I saw that same account comment the same thing on the packers post about hiring [NAME] yesterday lol
I was more interested in seeing if anyone had quotes from him saying one way or another
Things have changed since then. Now it is known what leave looks like it has no support, so it is logical to revisit the only alternative.
The US and Canada are great allies, it's really a shame they've elected their worst. 
Yo this is actually awesome storytelling and also if I were you I would have clocked [NAME] into next week. Just sayin.
Good job for politicising a tribute to a local TV show beloved by many.
Where do you think the [NAME] came from, before they arrived in Spain?
I pray for the day they fix their copyright system and put it in the update description
I.E. dictatorial control of foreign countries for the purposes of resource extraction.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt like my friend‚Äôs opinion either
Please stop cussing.
My mom assumes that every guy I hang out with is automatically my boyfriend or someone I like.
If she stole a wallet with an activated card, or something along those lines. Once it's purchased, it's stealable.
I‚Äôm so sorry :/ always happens to the ones who deserve it the least. feel better‚ô•Ô∏è
Explaines Why I‚Äôm on the lookout for cats when I‚Äôm anxious! Thanks
no, you always upvote what fits the sub
No, I mean that each single individual will commonly use contradictory arguments just to satisfy his comment-du-jour. Everyone but incels realizes it.
I don't think there is any correlation between sugar and hyper behavior.
This sounds an awful lot like a solicitation. In case it isn't, what you seek may exist but you'd probably have better luck with the lottery.
I've been there. It's one of the most diverse places on Earth.
I didn‚Äôt even realize it says it right there. Sorry
came here to find the person who hasn‚Äôt seen this movie so i could feel bad for them
Thanks for blocking his face OP. Could have been bad.
You d be surprised how ‚Äú 3rd‚Äùworld slum people treat differently abled people
The suspension bridges are awesome on sunny days
Damn you have a lot of alts. :D
This is fucking hilarious
[NAME] is Television. Got it. He's too misogynistic to be the Patti Smith Group.
Fuck you.
Did you hear about that old Italian chef? Sadly, he pasta way.
Sucks even more to be the sons that actually died ehü§î
Don't get your hopes up; apparently car seats also cause autism:
Fuck you, u/SamuelZeign ! Your breath smells funny.
Sending love and strength vibes <3
You know the answer man, you are programmed to capture those codes they send you, don‚Äôt avoid them!
Exactly. That's why I'm watching his videos as well. ;)
Holy shit it actually did... how
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
Gets kinda itchy.
My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.
That‚Äôs exactly what it was. Exciting entertainment. Sometimes you just gotta let go & accept it for what it is.
[NAME] lmao
Imagine the baby being retarded
If you have this many concerns and red flags going, or something seems off, you can back out whenever you want, do it now. 
You‚Äôd be surprised what people could find with just a town name and doctor. Just looking out. If you already considered it ignore me.
omg [NAME] and his dad walking out together is so cute üòç
Oh really?
I think that's just natural, humans weren't really intended to fly by nature so I guess it just feels wrong or something, idk
I am sorry but what is a wholesome meme
I remember being so excited when we got AAA back, even though it cost us Fournier...man, that sure went south. #ThanksShaw
Not bad imo
This, this is brilliant
Aquaria looks great but her eyebrows look like gummy worms lmao
Makes sense since he usually is the one to clean up kills while others make contact
Unpopular opinion: I'd rather the team signed 26-year-old [NAME] over 30-year-old [NAME] coming off another leg injury.
Makes sense, thanks!
I think there are more deleted comments than actual comments.
Hopefully you're ok now & doing some good stuff
No I am still friends with the person I value his friendship he can just be...judgy?
I'm a parent and am telling you that dude is sad and insecure as fuck.
Yep of course.
Out of curiosity, about how many students were in the class?
Just wondering how they did it visually with all the fireworks going on
Are you pro fracking?
Wait, what do you mean by NOT tanking? Is that legal?
His left hand is mightily fucked.
I‚Äôd be afraid to get high after that yo
[NAME]. Am I doing this right?
i am a man and i disagree. i mean you logic is worse if you believe it.
Incoming 20m a year contract [NAME] !!!
Splendorinthetrash is a genius, undoubtedly!
Thanks for the post [NAME] hang in there bb.
Man, that sounds like a big stuff around. Good luck getting it sorted
I‚Äôm glad you fixed Minnesota, because there is a 0% chance we will go Red.
Ah okay, thanks!
correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but when [NAME] eliminates [NAME], she technically has a better track record than [NAME]?? i‚Äôll fucking cry
If you were to ask me how my 2016 went, I could go on and on but politics wouldn‚Äôt even come up once
see im on here having fun meming on all yall basement dwellers, stay salty 
Without any kind if proof beyond ex gf‚Äôs texting eachother, im not going to just up and believe this
Hard pass on this!
Whoops Ya probably shoulda put a /s there.
Where did he say he's superior to [NAME], anyway? 
Thank you thank you!! I have a feeling I will be reading for a while!
>Would I pull my gun if that were happening to me? >absolutely
Yea. From my estimation I have about 5 years before I should just pack it up completely.
mavs fans and r/nba as a whole are weak spirited smh i gotta step my trolling up
Why not both
Man fuck, I didn't come here for these feels...
Funny they decided to show a bunch of T2 images demonstrating the chronic microvascular ischemic disease and omitted the diffusion which had the more interesting findings pertinent to TGA.
Will be interesting to see what happens next, one thing for sure is [NAME] won't just fcuk off, you can't get rid of the woman
Wow, Michelin star for $25. That's nuts. Thanks for the heads up. 
These comments are in stark contrast to the more level-headed ones in r/news. Wonder why?
Although these are seemingly overpriced, yes, I adore these pieces.
How poignant.
That does help a bit, thanks.
I am afraid to look, but my morbid curiosity draws me to ask.
This is horrific
Yes, let‚Äôs start locking up people without any evidence that they did anything illegal. Definitely not an extremist POV.
No! They‚Äôre still on the sidewalk right there! With literally absolutely no way around them!
Now go to Gulag!!!!
Very well said.
Why are you assuming the guy will be locked up? What terrorists have we released from prison?
Yeah wat a fucking knob right? Fucking nick...
He didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, he made sure all three kids got a puck.
"Game still ""fun"" if you don't tryhard and play on QM but some people are trolling on other mode and that's Can be hard for nerv."
I get it. I hate that [NAME]. Taking advantage of sad people.
Complete with ‚ÄúNo Stairway to Heaven!‚Äù sign
They're probably usually too fixated on how they look to even consider their surroundings
Drs hate him!
Almost like being in Love by [NAME].
Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
Imagine if [NAME] had got a service fault twice on match point?!
[NAME] got a thing for redheads? [NAME] would love to have a word with you.
And yet none of ya'll are willing to even let 3rd party candidates in the building. Got to love the hypocrisy
"""Holding [NAME] up like baby [NAME] would be a fantastic way to excite a fan base that‚Äôs been neglected for years."""
you are a very nice person!
Yes.... because they are dictatorships.... capitalist america is ending bad too if you pay attention.
So cute! This lady thinks you're hot!
I'm active here and hadn't seen it posted before, wasn't on purpose but maybe it means i'm not alone
TIL I learned there are no drugs or violent incidents in prisons.
All that interesting information and you get 3 upvotes , feels bad man 
Huh, so there should be no more men's and women's sports, bathrooms, prisons, etc.?
Username does not check out then... I think?
They shout it near the end. Listen for WAAAAAAALLLLLL
Honestly, same. I was miserable at my admin asst job.
‚ÄúBut [NAME] wants you to have kids!‚Äù [NAME] should have given me ovaries then lol
"Because eye witnesses have always been proven to be credible. ""Hands up, don't shoot"""
I have trophy jeans and a trophy bra! Although RIP my boobs because they were the one thing I liked about my body back then :)
Eh, that can happen anywhere. It isn't exclusive to Dallas where that stuff happens. Good luck tho.
Seeing as how someone was raping her, it doesn't surprise me that much that the facility would be so negligent that they wouldn't notice the pregnancy.
How does it actually work? Thanks for the response; aspiring entrepreneur with no knowledge of corporate finance
[NAME], going to go tell my husband that if this ever happens to pick me.
Aw thanks for the hug, and yeah he did sound like a jerk. 
80% of the country is putting their faith in a man who doesn‚Äôt even have personal awareness of where he is.
You know better. People will just ignore this and move on to their next talking point.
They're not. They're rolling super hard. And loving it!
I changed team snapchats name to ‚ÄúBae‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù so i get exited every time I get thing from them.
as a woman, I can tell ya it‚Äôs not uncommon for that to happen, haha. [NAME] make it extra sad though.
Clean it up
I'll help hide the shovels beforehand
I wanna believe it's a reference to CNN hosting 500 town halls & debates with [NAME] since the election.
It would still be like hardcore then, you start a new life but retain nothing from the last
Man, and I thought the princess and the toad was an odd story
I am [NAME] total lack of suprise
Easy, stop men from fucking them. Cant be a slut if no one fucking ya right?
I don't really want to do anything.
Even Rolling Storm seems better, and it is not very good.
What are you on about?
Went to a rave Friday night so I spent the day asleep. No regrets.
He NOPED the fuck out of there at the end
You can do it!!!
I‚Äôm sorry :(. Lol. For me, after the ending of 3, and Andromeda, I have zero interest in ME.
Thanks for the suggestion!
He looks normal. This entire post is a massive reach
I agree with this
What I figured but needed some clarification. Thanks!
Fuck yea!
Haaaaay it‚Äôs the NAGR Guy!!!!!
[NAME] didn‚Äôt just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn‚Äôt a dog fighter, he is a sociopath.
Holy shit, that's great!
Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter
Thank you so much. I will involve my landlord/Roomie
I always keep my purse by my side. She is asking for trouble.
Then you should lawyer up
Good loss for the tank. [NAME] and [NAME] played really well.
Nice mix of trashy and classy.
but a dude
Damn that‚Äôs a big F from me :(
Anarcho-capitalism is indeed a joke, yes
This gave me a bit of a wider perspective on playing my guitar, actually. So thank you.
Lmao. Fuck, you got me good.
Aw it‚Äôs so nice of OP‚Äôs mom to take care of these cubs.
I apologize for my error. I'm not currently up to date on my regional flip flop styles.
Meanwhile... [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] don't benefit at all from playing with better players
The third floor isn't high enough. I'm also in dire need of a job and the stress is unreal.
Perfect World was my first mmorpg that I played for years. Super fond memories of the game.
thats right i do remember you!
The only sub that‚Äôs really bad now is the GKS the others are fine actually.
I can‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs just how the site works, I wish I could but I can‚Äôt 
It's rape after they've both consented? You're what's wrong with society today, try to be less of a dipshit going forward.
Feel free to use as many rhymes as you want, after all you have the final say of your word play.
What type of migraine do you think it is? Hope you get better soon
I'm surprised they've gone this long not knowing [NAME] swears a lot.
So you wouldnt keep [NAME]?
make those damn lazy millennials find a job sooner /s
Political affiliations has only little correlation to individual intellectual ability
We had some sparkling apple in our ICU tonight as well! Happy new year!
he ded.... and why the fuck these POSs have cellphones in prison.
As bad in what ways? The rest of who? Other politicians?
She sounds abusive and narcissistic. Delete your facebook, hit the gym and kill her. 
Because your considered ‚Äúboring‚Äù. Girls love drama. It‚Äôs a thing.
Better a pseudopenis than a lot like the same thing.
cheers for the replies guys. appreciated
I... uh... oh dear... ummm.... Please tell me you‚Äôre indulging 19th century race theory ironically.
There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful.
Forcing your partner to suppress their interests because you dislike them.
I don't believe it is. like other posters have said, you can do better. I know it's hard but you are strong. 
Are any other carriers better? I ask out of ignorance, but I was under the impression they all sucked
Thanks for the honour of speaking with the representative of atheism.
FYI this gif is a hit on [NAME] so yeah both sides think this is hilarious!
Physical copies at my preffered online retailer actually sold out. Its crazy. For all platforms.
Damn, that was dirty.
I may have undersold the amount of trucks. üòÇ
The article didn‚Äôt use it. OP just did a bad copy paste I think.
If you‚Äôre a solo player, then I understand...
I love the idea of a farm school. I'd totally do that if I could.
I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.
He knew what it was, he had just never eaten it somehow.
Will try. Thank you
The games are that expensive, because corporations have figured out that people will pay that price point. Now bugger off.
The healing feels intermittent. I accomplish and then relapse to why did I stay. Why did I even say yes when it was always there...
Well it was just an educated shot in the dark but glad to help üòä
It's good though because itll make you cherish the happy times while youre in them, instead of lookinf back on them.
This man just posts facts and got -220. He told them the truth and they hated him for it.
[NAME] being in foul trouble really ruins things for us
It wasnt a terrible idea until [NAME] got injured and [NAME] got complacent
Has to be [NAME] doesn't it? 3 [NAME] in the squad with another on trial, plus they're pretty shit this season.
They wanted to hit the international domestic market. They're setting up Arcade systems now, they're currently in beta.
Wow! You've put my relationship in words I couldn't think of.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt get paid 30 million a year to get my a** kicked.
I can see that! Let's say that I'm less enthused by that idea now than I was after Mania last year...
I wish I could be desensitized to my sadness sometimes lol
my credit is not good enough for a loan and having no job would make it impossible to get 6k. and being able to speak.
Don't forget colors. They panic at the sight of a chess board.
Of all of the fan-favorites from each city, [NAME] being the fan-favorite confuses and annoys me most. Her headlines are becoming insufferable.
Really worried about NISA translating it, but at this point I don't care any more, as long as we get an english version of it.
Love mine too. t-shirt
Ok what deal would you like to see made?
You bottomed out, worked, and wanted more. Feels great, doesn't it?
I would love to see spirit in her kimono as well if that,s possible in the future >< I love your work !
I liked the Japandroids for that one year
I've removed your post. You can create a new post with the link.
I‚Äôm in the same boat with anthropology. 8 months post graduation. Still no job prospects. Glad I‚Äôm not alone
Fuck sake man
I was linked the unarchived link and it has some important updates. Wish the OP wasn't so salty and linked the actual
Must not have been the [NAME] of his day... But seriously though i hope he's alright..
Keep them fighting so you can run out the back with the money.
Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.
I hope things get better soon. I'm proud of you for getting help and talking about it and wish you the best
I really hope you won't have the chance to enjoy them because man, I didn't like them anything :)
You're welcome. I'm always up for providing ammo for fighting the narrow minded and religiously intolerant.
Oh no I was laughing at that master trolling. that's like 20 years of buildup
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** Korrk! ^(hug)
The brick details actually look good. Everything else - ehhhhhh.
Omg, the kitty bites the knee and then looks at the human to gauge reaction.
Thats true. Those kinds of drinks can give you a heart attack.
It depends on if she can download discord and I was planning on emailing her when she gets it
Thanks bro!
This brings a smile to my face
It just never got weird enough..
Today I wish I were a black bear.
You know nothing about this guy... this is a not cool thing to say.
This WILL work for you [NAME]!! I have hope for you bro!!
Hahahah this is awesome.
That‚Äôs great! I hope s/he gets better!
The cutest.
Especially if he looks good in your bra and panties ...can he give me his number?
How has nobody in the coaching staff tried to stop [NAME] from going in and killing us
My selfless boi
And then you finally hit it only to drop it off the end table.
"The ""[NAME] says it's true"" line makes me think he's messing with you."
She's blindfolded too! It's like they're trying to write a shitty remake of Blackadder with these cunning plans.
Thanks for sharing that info. I'll see how low I can go. Did you do a trade in?
i dunno, you commit one little genocide and you never hear the fucking end of it
I love this and you

Look at the corner where the mirror meets the wall. There's an extra cockroach that's on one side but not the other.
I would meet up in a public place first. Invite her to a bar within walking distance of your place and assess. Safety first.
Weirdly I never heard of this show till I saw it on the RTE player this morning, and now this post... Maybe its a sign? 
Suddenly, a loud audible groan from every structural/civil engineer in Maryland that now have to deal with that bullshit :/
Seems fun, wonder how she would have ended up if the ca er was not there
Seen as Child abuse in some places. Not illegal but judges hate it. No matter the sex.
She might die before then, risky move either way.
I'm just happy I have the Pen to watch and listen too when the Steelers are on the brink of collapsing...PLUS no locker room drama...
I forgot not everyone has accused me of
And then attacking you as a person when you say you'd prefer not to be stalked and murdered. Sorry but your friend is a problem.
But muh narrative! Orange man caused this!!!!!
You‚Äôre not being clear in what you‚Äôre trying to say. I‚Äôm unsure how to try to help you in this case.
That is an image that I will never be able to forget.
[NAME] today is great, when he plays like this he is a rly good player
I wonder how fat activism intersects with animal rights tho.
At least it's not a T bone
[NAME] can be my friend!
It was or I‚Äôd have walked out!! Lol!
Doesn‚Äôt matter if it makes sense, as long as the libs are mad you can say it
Well you got me. Interested in seeing what other E rides people got
dude i get that he was making a joke
Found an Instagram account
Unfortunately for you, no one of importance cares about your absurd views. 
I wish mine believed in it. Haha. He was just bouncing on his bed and laughing, then crying. Maybe he‚Äôll get it eventually.
"Not one single figure anywhere to be seen. Reminds me of auld Soviet propaganda. ""The harvest is up"" ""People happier than ever"""
What a legend this fellow is, novak the one and only
Your idea of what a nice entre or nice wine cost at a restaurant are... Interesting....
Seems like a strong negative reaction to something you say you know nothing of...
Please keep your head up, things get better, stay strong. :)
Bumble is also great!
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
Hey girl!! East Bay here!
Is your brother incel? Is your dad upset you came out ugly?
TRETINOIN. Get your Retin-A on!! Way down the road your skin will thank you, and your friends will be envious.
I‚Äôm sorry than happened to you and your family. Really puts things into perspective.. thank you for the reply !!:)
We should build a pipeline! Oh wait...
So many players from the current crop are going to end up on 300+ games, crazy to think how exclusive it was not too long ago
Thanks very much. I'm off work in a week or so. I know where I'm heading!
Libraries are usually a Freak Show anyway.
I'm sitting here as he has never even lurked.
has the face of someone that had one too many pain pills for breakfast.
Guy looks like he's taking a nasty deuce.
yeah what happened in this comment section... Hope these people are ok. TDS is very serious and real.
Miami is supposed to have beautiful people, but these camera shots of the crowd sure as hell aren't showing them.
I always thought that dent she caused seemed too real.
Great Scientists can keep you competitive even if you didn't get too much harassed in the early game.
It‚Äôs time to stop lad, it‚Äôs getting a little embarrassing now...
I guess some people just hate fun, lol
AKA great!
This is uncomfortably lame
"I like how it's ""unacceptable"" lol. The nerve"
Ah! I couldn‚Äôt remember his name!
Nah, life is too short to drive boring car colors. 
Reverse racism is just racism
Glad this waste of time is over. Lets get back to the business of fixing this team.
Yeah for me it takes me weeks to get over s relapse
I completely agree they got fucked on that no call. And I absolutely love it.
I hope your gaydar has leveled up enough to filter these out now
Create new holidays. We need a Ralsei day where we celebrate fluffy bois.
Is freedom of expression a right or a law?
Oh no that's so awkward, I don't understand how people don't understand how weird things like that are! 
Option 1. If I'm ever stranded somewhere the only I'll need to worry about is finding fresh water.
Seriously we haven't gotten a stop barely at all tonight.
He‚Äôs just behind [NAME] and [NAME]. Having 2 second rows on the bench would‚Äôve been overkill when we‚Äôve got [NAME] available.
Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
they just dropped KAP45. Free for 2 amazing guns but a pistol costs money? What gives.
Screw them. We do what we have to do to get our kids to eat.
Love how thorough this answer is. I think it shows you know yourself well!
Why stop there
I really like this play on words.
Interested in Carlton stuff.
Born in Jersey, live in Kansas. I love my Lions. I was also 5, hated the Giants and liked the Lions unis. 
They don't want to waste the script they used for [NAME] campaign. Because that was such a rousing success.
[NAME] is expected to be back after the break. That's 2 games, [NAME] will finish those up
You have terms where the other person can't hang out with someone of the opposite sex? How is it gaslighting?
Oh [NAME] that's terrible. I hope things are better for you now.
thank you it‚Äôs just odd it randomly showed up and hasn‚Äôt always been there
‚ÄúYou okay? I‚Äôll call 9-1-1 for you guys.‚Äù -guy in the van that was running
Well regardless if I don't completely agree with your weights and measures of people. Thanks your input
Yeah thats exactly what I said. Im too weak to do it.
Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this.
Also, they ruined Top Gear but that‚Äôs a whole other issue.
Well it looks like I am going to spend at least a year renting to check the city out
Focus groups thought [NAME] was too attractive and the brethren were experiencing a burning in their loins and sinews so we fixed it.
My opinion is that this person's opinion is stupid, fallacious, and bad.
Spa's Absolutely love a spa. A proper one with a variety of sauna/steam rooms etc. It helps that they're usually full of women too.
I love rational comments.
Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
Yeah they look very buff
Everyone thinks that lol
food/pizza delivery.
"I'm so disappointed you didn't include [NAME] ""I'm standing under the source of the bull shit"" [NAME]"
Man up and get yourself a date with a different woman.
Very thoughtful post and good analogy.
Same except I also love the taste and meal options of meat. I could never do the veggie thing.
And I'm sure grandmas in SC love the stereotype of the violent black man.
When I feel down I listen to music.
She‚Äôs horrible
> it. Just because they're not vertebrates doesn't mean we get to kill them for amusement. It literally does though
I don't believe you, but even if that were true it still harms nobody
Can they do the same to Tyrael while they are at it?
But if you go to fredmeyer, which is also Kroger, It's like 50% cheaper on most things. lol.
hes leaving anyway might as well trade him bro
A nightmare hellscape future where the living envy the hot dogs
Good for you. But ignoring [NAME] situation makes the article pointless.
Eh so much easier to drug her and do what he wants.
Now THAT‚ÄôS funny!
Eh, some people grow up, get tired of banging their heads and decide to start using them instead üòú
How are we going to get a high 2021 pick? Unless we lose a ton of games of course.
Sorry I thought you called me dumb. Long story. A misunderstanding. Sorry
I mean... I'm [RELIGION] so...
Thank you SO much! This is so genuine and so helpful. Thank you so much for your time and your thoughts.
Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
Mexico didn't start the war. Thats probably where you are confused. The US invaded Mexico in both occasions, Mexico only defended itself in both occasions.
Fear of powerful women cripples all logic and invokes hysteria in seemingly normal people. For further information, see [NAME] criticism. 
Or take FETO, most of those purged probably never did a single wrong thing in their life What?
haha ye ik i was smoking weed for a while before a had to stop. thanks one love
Haha I‚Äôm two edibles in and have shoveled twice...
Love this! I follow interior designers, natgeo, and Better Homes and Gardens lol. It gives me decorating and baking inspo! No guilt or comparing.

Ah. So cardboard. Haha
I think it's your choice that determines it
The Homestead Crater is fun. I also like the Crystal Hot Springs!
Oh hey this is pretty awesome! I've never seen such a concise itinerary on one page before.
I do prefer achievements to trophies though, but the platinum is the only thing I envy PS users.
It's not my cousin's fault. It was actually me who set up the whole date.
thank [NAME] it was returned
> Sleeping next to someone I knew my wife is trying to kill me!
Haha colluded? Do you and your friends collude to take pictures together? Such buzzwords you are using lol
**WAIT THAT WAS A REAL STORY!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK**
But asking kids he teaches about him and then telling us that. Weird flex
Yeah I was impressed with it too! I've to pay to see results of responses past the 100th one but other than that it's top notch
You know, when I think of democracy, the first thing that comes to mind is best 2:3... Errr... 3:5.‚Ä¶.. uhmm... I mean 5:7... /**S**

So what you're saying is that you r/oopsdidntmeantoo?

Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
I don't swallow toothpaste idiot
This has to be a joke...
SC6 has a colourful cast and is actually very easy to get into. So yeah man, go for it.
Galaxy flip already exists. Its DMT, MDMA, LSD, Ketamine, and Cocaine together :) Never heard of anyone doing it tho
Damn this is really uplifting.
all the more reason to not give a fuck about CFF
No one makes it through. We all die. Just some sooner than others.
This is so wholesome I love it
Can you even hide the racism anymore or are we throwing all dog whistles in the trash?
Write down the problems and how you feel when and after you have them. Then take that to therapy and actually get vulnerable with your therapist.
[NAME] is amazing, big fan of him. 
I‚Äôm far to antisocial or have too much contempt for other people to do something like that
To be fair, the world (especially politics) has been kind of a shit show since 2016
Only Ten more minutes of watching [NAME] drop easy ass throws
And if [NAME] had any impact he would likely be playing in a 3rd next week
My hunch is, this is not the first or last wedding this bar has seen
you're right, it's all very murky
I agreed with your first point and then stated a statistic. My bad, awkward wording on my part.üò¢
Thanks appreciate it
Thanks I got sorted here anyway.
At least they've got their hand-cry coordination down.
Ty! I was going crazy tryin it, canging things... i'l wait then :-)
Then getafe should have gotten their first goal. Ref is really bad.
Thank you!

I think it is interesting that so many people have done (Owl Hoot Trail, Star Wars Saga campaign, and at the same trime.
This is me today, I have to do a 1-2 MINUTE presentation and I‚Äôm freaking out about it
Someone should take this wall of text down to the border. No funding necessary.
I was kicked, and apparently don't care about oversharing on Reddit about it anymore
what time is it now? i‚Äôm definitely in a different time zone
I‚Äôm a woman
Thanks for the detailed reply friend, much appreciated. I‚Äôm a history buff and love learning about these things.

The jealousy is more akin to a little sister who doesn't like that her dad isn't giving her all the attention.
What's the Pi IPcam you set up? Link? Sounds interesting.
Struck a nerve I see. Press X to doubt
People who unironically call others ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù tend to get offended way easier than anyone else.
When are you and dad going to pop out a few baby-mammas for us boys, huh? And that's the *less* disgusting alternative. Blech!
Rejection always hurts, even just a little. Sparing her feelings may mean she doesn't get the meaning. Be direct, kind, but direct. 
I'm watching it for the first time now. He's perfect for the role lol [NAME] is a god to me now
I'd love him to get a pick6/scoop and score and chief slam on them
Thankyou! :)

[NAME] a fucking creeper. Doesn't he have some weird ass relationship with that 14 year old girl from Stranger Things?
NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE Those leggings lmao
Imagine getting banned from r/NFL for saying the Saints only SB win is tainted. Feelsbadman.jpg
The guy that started everything vs the guy who will end everything.

[NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
Fortnitecompetitive be like, cater to me instead of the people who make you billions.
5‚Äô8ish my guess. The one thing that blew me away I went to a COD event was how short majority of pro‚Äôs are
Pareto principle, 20% of the work done gets you 80% results.
With the rate we‚Äôre making some of these threes it‚Äôs just hard to imagine anyone keeping pace.
He's being serious but the man himself is a joke.
This isn‚Äôt a left vs right issue People say stupid things. Both the left and the right
[NAME]. Can't believe she went to Parliament nine-months pregnant just to vote on the thing. That's dedication.
He wasn't being a jerk he was playing .they are friends you can tell by the way they interacted
It would be hilarious if it was a pasta place too
5 make the football hall a year as players. It‚Äôs a huge event when we get the rare 4 man induction in MLB
I will downvote the hell out of any news article promoting ponzi schemes.
The person who got those wanted to stand back and watch people try and shove it into their mouths. Laughing ensued.
Gonna get a cheeky nandos with the mandem
Reminds me of [NAME]
Are we all just going to ignore the fact that [NAME] is doing haircuts now?!
Feeling good in the gayborhood.
Significantly better in my estimation. [NAME] = [NAME] [NAME] = [NAME]
An imaginary god won't make you feel better, that's right, just the one true Living and Eternal God of Great Mercy who loves you.
No TV Party for you üëé
This is exactly what I‚Äôve been thinking!
Can genes be altered? I feel like I‚Äôve heard something like this.
Omg so glad I‚Äôm not alone
He can‚Äôt do that! Shoot him, or something!
That‚Äôs really cool of you to do man!
Who knows. The source and medical journal is about 18 years old. So maybe more research has shined a better light on it since then.
So not a single MP wants Brexit to be canceled? You really believe that?
Seriously! Like can any foreign power just come in and appoint a president?
not at all lol. me and my friends are makeout sluts though
It's interesting that [NAME] said [NAME] was his teacher on playing doomfist. Actually in mid 2017 [NAME] was one of, if not the best doomfist in China
I never knew cringing could be so ...cathartic.
I got a good laugh at this one. I feel bad.
Right back at ya! Also love the username!
He's not even HC, he's interim... relax chief
The altcoin thread!? This is the first time I've seen it in 6 months.
Hang on, I'll see if I can find them and then I'll get back to you. :-)
It‚Äôs shame that despite the years of dedication, persistence, and hard work. His efforts are reduced because of his height.
It infuriates me how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
He looks like a genuinely nice guy. He doesn‚Äôt look fat and greasy

Same.... I'm just perplexed
And I call them alcoholics who can't hold a relationship together
Idk I always hear thing about them like they‚Äôre all monsters
I think you'll find there is only one big one, lasting less than an hour.
Maybe. The only other time both sites of players should be fully baked is just before a world cup but that's not a good time either.
Good thing I don't give a shit.
You should braid your pubic hair just to really piss him off
I keep hearing [NAME] is a terrible hire.
Yes it‚Äôs like passing around the donation plate in church.
I'm really excited for this. I loved the sense of adventure / danger in Sunless Seas.
This is borderline experimental
Hello. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. Why do you think it‚Äôs impossible to leave?
sorry you have to deal with things like that. i hope things are better where you are now
I just wished they took [NAME] with them.
I read the books right after season one, and so I had the reverse problem. I didn't see the show as the same series anymore.
Thanks for the recommendations!
Great! Can't wait :)
Are you afraid of [NAME]?
Thanks, Now I hate you, and will have dreams about this tonight.... Just what I needed
This is what it's like to have a heart attack in the Cars universe.
Gah sad high five. I tried once for a few weeks and will never try again. I need that support in my life.
Bugger them all
Well said man. I hope you‚Äôre doing better now. Love the username btw.
aye they buggin for no reason im just saying good job keep it up.
For me it‚Äôs the complete opposite. Complete dread in the morning and usually more hopeful in the evening.
I like were ur head is.
I heard some vague rumors but nothing as specific as this. Do you have a link?
And yet OP couldn‚Äôt imagine a world in which they kept their brownie at their desk ü§î
Now her child will walk around smelling like onion
Just like in Seinfeld when the waitress called the audible after [NAME] talked about how much he likes manure.
This, she's giving you one word replies because she wants you to go away.

Maybe this person only likes musicians with the letter B. Let‚Äôs see if they like Busdriver. Also, chanting for ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù is the best. 
I lowkey love the chicken and waffles from longhorn chicken. It‚Äôs a food truck in west campus.
Unless something changed I'm pretty sure you can't add flairs on the default Reddit app.
Honestly, that‚Äôs wife material. Get on that! 
[NAME] would get jealous easily.
I know I am still going to frequent Argonaut and my other neighborhood family owned liquor store.
They forgot the part where everyone started clapping.
The table actually hit her in the back of the thighs, breaking her fall in the process. She was probably fine long-term
So has [NAME] if you want to be very picky.
Got it!
"Its a mandatory requirement to be an accredited ""[NAME] da"""
I‚Äôm kind of scared to talk to my manager about it
I suppose it's better than [NAME] eating while drooling.
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop being greedy!
25 m from Canada! out for 10 years now! I'd love to make a new penpal!
Salaam, these thoughts happen. It is the shaitan trying to divert you from the path. May [NAME] grant you patience and the steadfastness to protect yourself.
"I misunderstood ""come back strong"" "
I like it!
I don‚Äôt even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
You now have 3 threads about this within the last 10 hours. Pick one and stick with it.
I feel like [NAME] had the right idea losing the will to live. Now if only I could learn this power...
Your smartly worded refutation of the whole of the rest of Christendom has swayed me completely, Rome is the only true home! Hurrah! Hurrah!
You seem worried, [NAME].

Nothing wrong with kayo
You are the only person you can depend on
So many questions unanswered. Poor guy.
glad you made the trip from a fellow austinite
My question is for [NAME] and [NAME]: What would be the one piece of advice you would give to aspiring Overwatch coaches?
Great deal for us, happy he's back. Up next, [NAME]! 
Someone obviously has not had a good experience with anal sex. But I appreciate your advice and sense of humor at least!

I mean, none of us think it‚Äôs an insult. You don‚Äôt need to explain that.
Looks like a good DILF look to be fair lol
Very true, honestly. Hopefully one day indiginous issues won't be a political career killer, and we'll have a PM that dares to do something.
Coincidence vs correlation vs causation
I just say I don't know shit. I'm just a ape man on a rock.
Your patience to find the perfect moment is... Please just let me slow clap.
Then leave, if that is your purpose.
Happy Cake day.
Thanks, I'll resubmit
Say thos: mom, dad, she's busted. Respect my wishes!
Lol this was cosmetic. Thankfully both of mine are alive and well.
They treat [NAME] like he‚Äôs [NAME] now, no wonder he‚Äôs so lukewarm to this market 
Can‚Äôt believe they actually got married. What a joke

Bumper is cheap, at least you alive. Perspective.

these people are holding our country back. Im happy natural selection is taking its course.
Ive seen that move no less than 5 times and I still get irrationally angry at the Harvard rich kid
hey at least you've got a friend group chat
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.
My office has very few personal offices. Its awful. Managers need closed spaces so they can talk without everybody hearing
Hopefully you will be ok.
Even though I didn't know you personally, but I just want to say that I am proud of you. This is an inspiration.
Would anyone actually pay close to $100? And how difficult would it be to do this?
Let's go pack!
Sorry for the delay. Nanaimo's a union/mill town, so no surprise the NDP won.
Yeah how dare the puck not magnetize to [NAME] stick. Not his fault at all.
Interesting, hopefully somebody might be able to provide you an answer.
i can imagine going to a job interview and the one of the committee just immidiately shouting *Audentes Fortuna Iuvat!*

There was a huge pervasive fear of nuclear war in the 80s among kids. I remember often waking up screaming from nuclear nightmares.
Awesome! Thanks! I'll start the process tomorrow!
Sure, sorry for late response.
I got mine at 21. The ex wife would have had me snore instead of wear it for years.
Not sure how anyone whos been paying attention could
Yeah, if companies really wanted to ameliorate the lack of programmers they could hire and train more juniors, but that doesn't benefit them much.
I wanted to know if there‚Äôs was another like meaning to the whole selfie thing not if she liked me or not

My cockatiel is sitting on my knee. I gave him a hug and promised no more pets.
Thank you. I needed someone else to say it. The unnecessary misgender as a parting shot wasn't my favorite either.
I'm really considering making this my flair
Your friend is an idiot. You were the embodiment of Be More Kind. [NAME] bless you
"""Meatball Mayhem"" would be an interesting battle royale game mode.."

I think a [NAME] government would be far far worse than Brexit.
I have his signature on my jersey. Lined up at Canadian Tire for it when I was younger. Happy retirement!

I love music but I haven't given a shit about the Triple J's Hottest 100 in at least 10 years
Smooth or chunky?
That was my first thought
Yeah, which is not helping citizens with continued attempted scamming. 
Ranked #3 edge defender in the NFL, 25 years old, and makes our division rival weaker
or just more competent.
Believe me when i say not having a job doesn't change anything. It's an endless nightmare being ostracized from people your whole life.
You must be fun at parties.

I will, eventually. Thank you for the kind words.
*dun dun* no but seriously, go full no contact with this predator. 
Why you mad bro
Who's we? Because a lot of people on your side don't seem to want that.
Death treats are for immature people, I'm sorry you received them. Comparing you to flat earthers is not far off though.
this actually made me LOL, thanks
Omg where did you get this?
People hate him? Why? Most call him the most dominant player in CFB this year.
He‚Äôs 30 freaking years old and is scared of managing a bank account. *eyeroll*

Hang on to all sorts of things just in case. Eat inexpensive food.
You too! (FYI I accidentally initially replied in a new comment, in case you didn‚Äôt see my other reply)
What kind of behaviour is considered unattractive? I'm pretty clueless when it comes to dating.
She‚Äôs a [NAME] also, but I doubt that means much in the entertainment business..
I remember it like it was yesterday.
alright, i'll be the one to say it. the tongue looks like an orange penis, congrats
toxic players will sure show you the ways soon enough. Hope you got the game for free.
I don't know who that is
That's awesome to hear. Now withdraw every dime from that website and never go back to it ever again.
The realization is pretty grim. Can't say I'm terribly happy.
[NAME] might be all those things, but he pissed me off canceling his appearances at Coachella and Gov‚Äôs Ball. Very unwavy of him 
For a sec I thought I was on NoSleep. I'm glad no one got hurt.
Thanks for defending your tribe.
That's awesome to hear :)
That would be awesome
"Love how the cop comes and gives him the old ""there, there"" pat on the shoulder"
FFS. I find very few things more upsetting than reading their vile, twisted thought processes.

Consider yourself one of the lucky ones. A. no attorney fees B. safe to say you‚Äôre dodging a bullet.
Hell yeah! Make sure you get your tickets in advance because we are getting very close to selling out!
It's funny to consider DMC2 had characterization
Well the last time we got a premier like this, the conservatives didn't get power again until [NAME] and only because [NAME] misstepped at the last second
>arent as attractive as their peers Except for the women who date older RICH men, those tend to be more attractive.
Dude don‚Äôt even trip. [NAME] is the shit. I also have a soft spot for [NAME] if you‚Äôre into her at all lol
[NAME] deserves better
Not sure why you got downvoted so hard when everybody above is saying the same thing.
Why do they always threaten with a block? Like how do they not see that‚Äôs not a threat that‚Äôs a solution?
Me too, whenever my friends get with people I dont feel happy for them. I just feel envy and rage.
Do you even watch Steelers football?

What does it matter we're just going to take another bust in the middle of the first round like always
Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. 
This is the single dumbest defense out there for aim assist. This shit is just retarded.
And also, turning someone's hands into spaghetti is cruel and inhumane and not a reasonable punishment for theft.
I hear ya man, it sucks that we live in a world where we have to worry about so much nonsense instead of just being ourselves. 
The younger one looks like she really gained some weight. I can't remember her name.
Cant talk about the a***a
Yes! I just wish that the good would be gone. It‚Äôd be great if he had his Injustice 2 look
[NAME] is fascist? Everything that isn't leftism isn't inherently fascist.
It was a customary practice of prostitutes in the Arabian peninsula.
Is it that common? Here on the tube on London there is barely room to breathe let alone spin so I guess we avoid this kind of crap
We dem boys.
I like it
I‚Äôm just doing it ironically to own the libs! /s
‚ÄúI do too. One of them is Hulu.‚Äù

This type of view leads to people like [NAME] being seen as untouchable
You didnt!
Now I see why it takes me 30 minutes extra to get home if I miss an exit.
It definitely has the best look to it. Also the best characters. Count [NAME] henchmen are amazing.
I am. He's the easy pick. Would be perfect for this franchise. I'm worried that he won't make it to us.
This comment has been removed for breaking rule #8.
Nah [NAME] gonna be an asexual for sure.
I once looked for my phone with my phone flash light
this kid is really good
Speaking of low percentage.. FOR THE LOVE OF [NAME], CHARGE YOUR PHONE!!
It's almost unfair. Time to shop for a sweater.
I just love the look of most benzos. Bars of course the most. But a handful of 10mg valiums or 2mg klonopin is also mouth watering :)
"I'm wondering how many players have ""PhD In Punishment"" -comment unironically."
Oh shit I didn't even connect those dots!
[NAME]* that would have been sliiiiick
He was only thrown in there so we could have [NAME] get heroically saved by him and so we would hate [NAME]
how do you think money is created? it is largely controlled by the government and is distributed to create certain results in our society.
Well I guess that solves it.... For you. I'll keep trying to make sense out of the evidence since you fail.
She‚Äôs so hot. Also happy cake day
But i like being the trickiest of traps üò£

You just don't know what phonetics are you lead covered life boat
Yeah. The defence is ‚Äúthey pursued her‚Äù so yeah it‚Äôs their fault.
I would have a similar reaction if she committed neck rope.
This is so aesthetically pleasing. Wow. And yum!
Haha. You are crazy. The world, and reddit world is filled with crazies and weirdos. You are a brave, brave soul. 
love em or hate em I think we can all agree that was blatant PI
Very glad to hear. Good luck. He has more control then he thinks!
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this too. But hopefully it helps to know you‚Äôre not alone...?
Yeah fair, plus this sub tends to go hard in different directions so it becomes extra hard to know if someone really is just that far gone.
Wow! This got far more real than I was anticipating.
Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
They've been banned. We'd like to start leaving up more comments though so that threads actually make sense. Capitalists will always be banned.

I wish someone would just run [NAME] or [NAME] open ice, it would be worth the penalty 
we can hammer out the details later .... don't worry, we'll nail her down on costs eventually
Lol i got bottled by one of them in a brawl with a bunch of the nazis
Or the damn Tremere.
[NAME] himself erased your memory of him screwing up. You shouldn't take these kind of things for granite.
Wow, that's clunky.
Nope, you weren't in the wrong at all.
One of the best and most consistent kickers over the last 5 years vs a guy who had a great season
Question for [NAME] the incentive to work hard?
You got this! Go easy on yourself man..
Does that work for the WSJ? I haven‚Äôt read an article from there in a year.
Yeah lets celebrate that only one guy (well maybe put dirk and [NAME] up with him) has come to play.
Didn't she also get people killed in Japan?
Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean. The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
Thank you :) it was hard to get back in the groove but now that I am, I don‚Äôt wanna stop!
Lol ‚Äúthis is my opinion and it is very true.‚Äù You said opinion, didn‚Äôt you?

Thanks for the laugh
She forgot about the Buttfor
If this happens in my dream then I will get up and do this.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend expensive brands in this subreddit. People get irrationally angry and condescending.
Your definition of a body is whats entertaining, laughable really !

I thought that was gonna be the Pelicans after [NAME] is gone(sorry Pelicans fans)
You need to dump him
Good idea, but unfortunately not running on the weekend. 
Also the reason for last year, playing him as a cb was necessary but proven to be a terrible position to be in.
The Chargers defense looks impossibly bad

Not enough that the median incomes for those without a degree to be close enough to those that did as to not be significant.
I'm ashamed that while trying to figure out what TKE stands for all I can come up with is Tau Kappa Epsilon.
Not me personally, but I do think it's an excellent idea. You never know when a stomach bug might hit.
I love this! It's nice to hear of a positive outcome on here.
Get your nose hair waxed. Trust me on this.
Do not diddle kids
Yeah, because it‚Äôs soooo arduous to look at someone‚Äôs profile for five seconds.

Empire was extremely popular at first. I think it gradually got worse after season 2. Those first two seasons were great though.
Because it‚Äôs more fun?
This happened to me too. Also how I found out my cpa is an exmo.

Brother, I am in tears, [NAME], I wish I had been there. 
Just a reminder that back in 1918, the Republicans were still the liberal party, and the [NAME] were the racists.

Shit like this is just depressing. Not surprising, but still depressing.
You can humanize and normalize everything.
Can you provide any evidence to your claim that right wingers are using this to smear her?
Youre right...shes one of my least fav characters. I think they use her as a straight foil in alot of episodes.

It doesn‚Äôt work as well as you‚Äôd think, but thanks either way
I think I should say that I am a student and have no income.
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.
As a bi bro; I have the exact same question
[NAME], she really is my least favorite queen I drag race history. Boring, try-hard, and busted makeup.
I love the way you wrote this. Outstanding
This 100%. [NAME] was a great enforcer, but him scoring a hat trick with the Thrashers was just crazy.
Sorry, didn't know where else to put it
No. Without getting into spoilers that ring is reserved for something else later in the game.
Ugh thank you everyone üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
I haven‚Äôt scrolled it down yet. I thought it was a woman then I saw the name.
So you want [NAME] & [NAME] to be like [NAME]? That would be so nice.

Happy Cake Day! I, too, have been a victim of cake.
Idk about that, but if you were being genuine I apologize. I just don't think that is the case in this situation.
The [NAME] work.
Exactly. It‚Äôs all about control
Not really, every other post is summit doing something. Gets boring.

It‚Äôs possible that the dog just escaped. Especially since it might be excited by the massive crowd running
Currently have 2 points. One is from when my cat died and the other is from a really bad migraine.
We‚Äôre honouring good King Billy. That‚Äôs also how we decided which [NAME] brother to buy.

I dont think a murder log that survived what killed off trex counts as cute, even if its only 2 or 3m long. 
Hruska is amazing. Their sausage kolaches or I guess klobasnik have the best sausage I‚Äôve ever eaten. It‚Äôs in Elliger, TX.
Honestly I thought it just meant any game where you couldn't choose Casual mode... which is everything pre-Awakening.
Funny that punches to the face are completely forbidden in Kyokushin competition.

Good kid.
"I do enjoy how insignificant the belltower looks in its surroundings nowadays. Still a waste of money. Thanks [NAME] of ""Wes-tern Australia""."
I was kinda just silent the whole time, we haven't spoken since.

Whoa. I appreciated this, thank you.

[NAME] has not played under [NAME] for a single day of his career.
[NAME] and [NAME] together for multiple games composed entirely of 3 on 3? This is a dream come true.
We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
That's forward heavy punch right? Sorry I'm pretty new to SF
The comments in there are so nonchalant I can‚Äôt help but laugh
Orange man bad is a much less funny meme than the actual image here.
As long as I have my plasma rifle and some combat armour, I think I can traverse the wastes without a ride just fine.

Gmod Wonderworld is a personal favorite and may be the most sadistic and hilarious thing [NAME] has done

State of [NAME] trying to be funny and spelling ‚Äòlose‚Äô wrong
Brain dead clearance. Honestly deserved lead. They have been better.
Ah ok well I have completed my bachelors degree so I‚Äôll look into subbing as well.
"Literally the reason he was discribed as the ""king of parries"". "

Who cares? I like fat people's opinions there.
I agree. That is a fight better left for later.
>Dude, nobody reads. That is *really* not true. 
Yeah I regret ever moving to Leduc. It's one of the most backwoods, proud-to-be-ignorant communities I've ever seen.
Sandwiching an argument between two insults. I like it - I might try it. Maybe that will get people to agree with me
Truly a sad day when you can get fired just for having a *heated gaming moment*. We really do live in a society.
[NAME] was my first Jersey as a kid blinked and he was gone
I love Big Brother, they make an appointment and come pick up used household goods and clothes. Easiest way to donate.

Time for a sit-down. Its important he recognizes that counts as an EA! Have him read How to help your spouse heal from your Affair.
A few years ago the offer for him would be like 21 million, not sure what it would work out to this offseason.
A part of my soul died from reading that. Thank you for making me dumber from this experience.

Hi everyone!
[NAME] is [NAME] and [NAME] daughter?

Ditto this. Happy hour after work is nice and low-commitment.
This is his website
That's what I can't understand either, what were they expecting by knocking on the door?
Wait what are the stereotypes? As a bi male I'm a bit curious to find out what others think in like.
Can‚Äôt wait to see this monster perp walk.
I pirated this movie last night and can confirm: it's truly awful. Not just lacking in good, but *aggressively* bad.
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.

What's up, man? I'm new to this but I will try my best 
Oops, just kidding [NAME], got you.

It's time to fertilize the lawns. A couple of 500lb bags should do!
I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/
I love having a deep bench, and being able to have really solid players step in when we have injuries. [NAME] was solid.

You sound like someone who doesnt know what ironic humour is.
Yeah I suppose lol, but either way yours is the best one I've seen so far 
Keeping his mouth shut? After cheerleading for the dictatorship, that's the least the scumbag can do.

[NAME] is honestly really badass and he has a great design I hope they give him something good to do in 11
when my friend introduced me to [NAME] i was only 7 or 8
One of my biggest regrets is that I never got to see [NAME] in person. Incredibly talented and the league is clearly better off for it.
not worrying about being condemned to eternal hellfire for it takes away one impediment.
that most of the fandom does not get that reference is depressing
No, but a cast member did talk to him after his yelling. 
Kratz and insertion in the same sentence makes me nauseous for some reason..
ive had a gedmatch account since 2012, i was just commenting that 23andme hadn't given me any more specific results than it had previously 
Thank you.
Both look great, but I like the second one better. I'm a dude though and I have no sense of what works for other guys.

The real joke is your grades dude
I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.
Who said anything about being confused? No disagreement here whatsoever. :)
[NAME], your uncle is not the hero you think he is.
It's like he saw it coming and wanted it to be close, so he kept his speed just to show the Xterra that they were wrong. 
These guys are playing hard to get. Gonna take off my bra, BLAST MY NIPS!
Your teaching disturbs him!

Old people look at me and see a massive failure, so at least you have appearances going for you.
My mommas homemade mac and cheese almost makes me cry on how great it is
Idk why everyone's being obnoxious. I thought this was a good post, OP.
Eh, loser. It‚Äôs sad how some people don‚Äôt care about their relatives.

there was some LPT about it, but i don't use those so i don't remember here it is : 
"""I'm a libertarian. I get attacked by both sides lol"" ""I voted [NAME] last election"" Uhhhh what"
I dated a guy from Steamboat Springs Colorado who used to do this. He had an immune system made of steel but it was absolutely disgusting.
I think, call before you come and limit it to an hour is reasonable if you have relatives that need to be told that. 
My phone was in the car while I was at the pool in NC and it happened to me guess I am actually in Australia

I think it's a r/fuckyoukaren joke
I‚Äôm still waiting for a sick dunk from [NAME]
"Lol I was just about to protest ""you can't know that!"" until I realized....."
I like how nobody else is doing anything to stop him
[NAME] is invaluable. Kawhi mama love him. Kawhi love him. His bow-legged ass is finally playing like NORMGOD again. He stay.
Puny god! Love it
"Whatever conclusion they reach now or in the future, the only constant will be that ""nothing should be done to stop it."""
He has a girlfriend. Unfortunately she is not thick. He needs to take a page out of [NAME] book.
I just call my girl and tell her I love her lol. Easy day.

Stop virtue signaling.
Forehead kisses, and any of the cute nicknames he calls me [NAME], best feeling being in his arms [NAME] I miss it all
I mean if she wants to create change has she considered changing her whole personality and just being quiet

The thin side and endlines are really throwing me off.
They're holding out for as much as possible... some mysteries arent that hard to solve
I fully support this
I'm disappointed [NAME] never plays guitar again.
Is there any way to force him to act? Sending more budgets or refusing to vote on anything non budget in the house etc.
My [NAME] it's a mad house over there right now. All of the posts are about letting boys be boys.
but but TIME IS MONEY right?
I'm three months old and I love Queen and Metallica, not the crap my generstion listens too.
And rock beats paper.
Sounds like you are the one with salty tears mate
I'm not a jealous person. That's not an emotion that comes naturally to me. I wouldn't try to cultivate it or maintain it.

IDK about you, but associating things with [NAME] do *not* make me want them more. Even delicious Cheetos. 
That‚Äôs how capitalism works
He looked like he fell in love
Shame is a powerful drug
Oh bless your heart. I found this so funny. Goodness.
MRW someone asks me what that new annoying app that's always advertising on Youtube is.

Too bad that's not the case. I'm happy I'll one day die.
Except [NAME] was actually extremely disruptive in college, and has some great film. [NAME] just doesn‚Äôt ..
Just rumors online, it most likely won't happen
Pre 1980 AC/DC is [NAME].
Kudos to you my friend. I'm so glad you are still here with us! <3
Stargazing with Vi is definitely my favorite moment of the season so far
That‚Äôs why I called them Turd Gen, haha. Getting a High Country/Denali with the 6.2 to replace it. 
Literally shaking, I hope you're getting the support you need with the ptsd this has obviously caused.
Good luck!
Yeah, but nobody takes McD's hamburgers seriously. 
I went nuts for a bit and stayed on them for much longer.
Wait, did they get married at the detention center? Why is she exiting with a bouquet? 
"The caption says ""tried"", but it seems she actually did get away with not paying. What really happened?"
I am just like this! Glad to know I‚Äôm not imagining it.
You got this! One day at a time.
This is a terrible tip. Please think before doing something like this.
Have a good night, mate!
He came flying out of nowhere for that. I was impressed.
You must be new around here.
I like all of them, depending on what I want to learn. I really like [NAME] and [NAME] style, because they are such trolls.

I, for one, am glad you didn‚Äôt. Happy you‚Äôre still with us 
I'm just trying to raise awareness at this point because I know it's not my system in particular.
[NAME] ain't all that. Sorry.
Must be a nice feeling...unless UDG is counted.
At home with a viral infection right now! Praying for death and to the god of paracetamol. Ugh.
There's an online service we had to upload everything to that checks it against all the other uploads it has received worldwide to detect plagiarism.

They were really supportive!
Ain‚Äôt that the truth. August is Hell!!

You don't need financial management when the government handles all your money and all your legal representation is also provided by all mighty government.
That sounds like a lovely time :D
Nah, you're nice peoples who eats pickles.
Bad luck you‚Äôre in Beckton
I think it should be a felony. Kind of crazy that illegally entering a country is such a minimal offense.
Wasn‚Äôt there a video of the exact same dude kicking down a fucking tree????
If he really believed those things, he was naive as hell.
That‚Äôs his dead cap to the Steelers. We‚Äôd take on about 14 mil at that point.
Wasn't implying that, just weird that a South African brand is so popular overseas all things considered.
Right? Seems like a nit of a reach imo.
Hopefully he will
Well thanks for sharing. I loved it. Do you know of any others from them that aren't well known?
Differently to whom? And in what regards? Most people are treated by others as if they weren't anything special.
You can replace the ram / SSD now on the new Razer blade 15 but ya razer sucks.

They are building a new Whole Foods on Smith and Elgin I believe

Absolutely no one was surprised at her choice to run in 2016...
American conservatism has been stolen by the neo Nazi, bigoted crowd. [NAME], [NAME], et al would vilify these hacks.

Doesn't stop you trying to hold court over on the US sub though.

[NAME] is the only one of those 4 to win a playoff game as a HC Keep in mind it was on a last second play, still counts
They can‚Äôt really do anything. Russia has far too much powering the organization for the un to be effective.
im actually really pumped to see how [NAME] does in Spain. hoping he gets some playing time to prove himself.
I'm in the Central Time Zone in the US so I have some time to go. But Happy New Year to you man!
Already I can can hear the screaming and howling of the neoliberal right. They will amuse me.
"""Why everyone hurts me?"""
Not a good time to make life altering plans like moving in with him right now. Good luck, though. [NAME]
I actually live in a place called Star City (ironically a really small town) so I thought it was the coolest thing to me.
He definitely is. Soon.
For the sake of football and this sub everyone wants [NAME] to win
So many of Pokimane‚Äôs fans are creepy 30+ year olds. I feel so bad for her.

At no point in the game has that been true
White Oleander is such a great book, I haven't thought about it for years!! Adding it to my kindle to re-read.
She was just trying out for the olympics guys calm down. [NAME] will be ok.
So more [NAME]? No thanks. Love the guys, but that‚Äôs for side projects. 
You made that up and are projecting your insecurities onto it.
I hope [NAME] bullies wittle baby [NAME] tonight, like he did last year!
Late-stage Reddit. I'm afraid it's malignant, there are only palliative care options available at this point.
Someone has already written [NAME] is the Aus Open winner on her wikipedia page. Haha
So I can‚Äôt do anything about it now?
She's slept with so many guys she's starting to look like one
Lol thanks for understanding that it's humor as a coping mechanism...there are some comments on here that don't seem to grasp the concept very well.
It‚Äôs all about the tech my friend. The person who knows how to control the modem has the power.
Well, my upcoming adverts are going to be interesting!
Maybe next time if you have 20K CAD keep it in actual bank instead of a crypto exchange.
Tee-hee. It's the same server side weirdness as in SWBF2. (This is probably my most repeated sentence in this sub.)

Did anyone catch [NAME] imitating him laying on the ice as the game ended? [NAME] as fuck
How did notre dame drop two spots when the played us closer than bama did?
But transit is amazing here.

Still waiting!
Mama [NAME] is not gonna be happy
And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.
Shaming men for trying to solve a problem on their own is actually an example of toxic femininity
It really is. I didn't know a thing about the feud and it caught me off guard how brutal it was. Enjoyed it a lot though.
Wait so did you permanently lose sight in one eye or is this just temporary?
I believe that you can search for providers here. Good luck and good on ya.
Because you deserve to live and be happy
Have fun!

Happy looking fella ain‚Äôt he!
You‚Äôre doing the [NAME] work.
Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene.
Yeah thats gucci man. You wander off into needy territory if she says no and you pester and beg her.
Yes, I‚Äôm sure [NAME] biggest concern is New Japan getting criticism on Reddit.
Oh thats weird. It opens the google maps app installed on my phone so i dont have that problem.
This is terrifying
I‚Äôm sorry but [NAME] has better memes
Awesome thank you! I‚Äôm sure it was fine to wear but new guy here not trying to stretch any rules quite yet
That's not justification to keep doing it. Also this would be the purview of the Democratic party since it's the primaries we're talking about.
Look at you, emotional.
I‚Äôm definitely leaving him. I have a 0 tolerance for cheating and won‚Äôt be staying for it to happen again
This is terrifying
I kind of want this win for [NAME] but I still hope we lose out hereafter
Well done, OP. Thanks.
This is great news. Congratulations!
He keeps saying this in my playthrough when that's definitely NOT what I'm doing. I just suck at hunting!!

That explains an awful lot about ICP.

Can't believe this didn't occur to me until now that [NAME] is [NAME] wife.
[NAME] or [NAME] could be a good trade piece. We don't have to solve every problem in free agency
The hardship of having the future meet the present. (or something)

Happy cake day
So because you are abnormal in you saving and spending habits you are unilaterally deciding no one else should strike when not getting paid.
You‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs a trap once you see the bill.

Definitely, too bad [NAME] is taking it as an attack on her when it‚Äôs really an attack on [NAME] and his behavior. 
It‚Äôs been good, made me able to function much much better. 
A video was just released showing this altercation. Within Syria is rarely wrong.
That fascist bigot!
They didn‚Äôt take it; you abandoned it. A TSA agent clarified that for me once. I hope you can replace it easily.
only Beijing? Forbidden City and national museum are great , $100 pre day would be enough to find a decent hotel.
>more money than you I seriously, *seriously* doubt that. >doing something before this guys are outta the country Prove it.
The word ‚Äòrap‚Äô was created by a guy who couldn‚Äôt pronounce his C‚Äôs. Fact.
My mom would go into those rages and I would pray my aunt would call because as soon as she answered the phone she was back to calm.
That young [NAME] looking dude is intense!
I was surprised the general public hadn't already heard of them tbh. They have been around for quiet sometime.
Weird, FBI did an investigation and proved that never happened. White knights make me cringe.
Why is it ghetto, though? You could've used any other word to describe the house.
*She. This was posted by a woman, apparently. Its just as disgusting either way though.
BECAUSE THERE IS A SHUTDOWN ATTACHED TO IT! HOW DO YOU NOT GET THAT?
It‚Äôs a metaphor. No one cares how big his anatomy is.
Ah, I see. Thank you for clarifying!
That is a very handsome dog.
Love your username!
I never understood the point of parole. Seems to me like an expensive way to increase recidivism.
Gee that sure is a strange way to spell [NAME].
Extend the compassion; go vegan.
Dude, calm down. Even a freshly arrived transplant can share in mourning the loss of a business that‚Äôs been there multiple decades.
Don‚Äôt think this was posted yet
yeah, it's basically Hillsong with sugary shakes pretending to be food. 
Hm... I can't help you then. I always go cold-turkey from any addiction I decide to quit. :/ That doesn't work for everybody.
I don't even find her that loud or that wild I think he's just no fun.
Seriously, compare the trash NRA puts out to the video that Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights put out on their FB on Tuesday.
Now it's a double birth stone, so it's extra special!
We can talk compromise, when they stop holding the country hostage. Until then, bye [NAME]
"What's the difference between ""Stop Zionist Gentrifiers"" and ""[RELIGION] Will Not Replace Us""?"
I switched to Ally and love it. 2.2% interest is awesome
Yup! She was also on a show called Queen Bees that was on the N network. I have never seen that show but I really want to
Two or three anti depressants before I told them a lie about how I tried my moms valium and it worked
thank u, thank u
*Busy hands bring clean minds.* Keep busy, time will pass, and you will have less anxiety about being alone.
oh [NAME] this is horrible
I am happy with North Sydney, Milson's Point or Kirribilli and happy with the 19th too!
One year non guaranteed That's what they meant by death star.
Weird headline. 2 children per mother would be expected to shrink the population.
That‚Äôs a great idea! Thank you :)
This sub has over 350k subscribers. How are there this many of us who enjoy this torture.
I ride our half-orc barbarian by clinging to his back. He hasn't seemed to notice yet.
I tried doing it but it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre Indecisive and always want to remake the characters design
One time on an early morning run I saw nobody coming down so I ran up it against traffic.
FOR THE LOVE OF [NAME] WATCH THE DUB. THANK ME LATER. You can watch it on Crunchyroll, Hulu, or Kissanime/Dubhappy clones.
A west coast NYE show consisting solely of sunset photos.
Nah? Sadness and wine don‚Äôt mix too well, my conception is proof of that haha 
[NAME] is there anything more depressing than being in a leafs gdt when the leafs are losing.
I love every bulge, scar, stretch mark and jiggle. Every single one tells a story I want to hear.
Happy New Years, sidepiece!
Oh that's lovely.
Was antisemitic rhetoric a problem in Nazi Germany? You're saying this question is the same as cheese tasting purple?
I love your honesty. What you wrote expresses fears and questions similar to mine. Thank you so much.
I second this. All signs point towards him biding his time until the next election and hopefully solidifying his place to expunge the filth.
Sorry for the bad formatting
Haha I'd like it if our parallel lines intersect *heavy breathing*
It‚Äôs shit. It doesn‚Äôt let you see schedule information.
Didn't u just say ur new to this? Why are you speaking?
I am not... Coast guard is not getting paid right now. I am sure they have families depending on that money.
It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
This is the only thing I care about from this entire season so far.
Your logic is pretty messed up and the pos assumption has zero to do with this. Centralized mining will cripple the ability to fight censorship.
I think I‚Äôm in that Facebook group. This should be fun haha. They‚Äôll prob eat you alive.
If too many medical professionals die then life will be worse as we cannot get medical treatment
I love making fun of social outcasts.
just because someone is born [RELIGION] does not mean they have not explored other religions too. Not everyone practices blindly.
Don't tell yourself those lies. They only serve to keep that weight in place. We're all lucky to have you. You're a gem
#YES.
FYI!!
It gives me hope as well!
Just be glad you‚Äôre not his wife
You are right and why you get downvoted?
You are a Filipino leprechaun
It‚Äôs because he so consistently lies and states mistruths. Why keep listening to a dishonest idiot?
Gonna use this on my kids tomorrow, thanks kindly
I can help.
I'm sorry to hear that things went down like that. Good luck with everything.
Happy Cake Day you barefoot bitch!
I'm confused. If she remarried isn't his income counted as support for the child if they intermingle their finances?
Dang, dawg. That one shocked me 
> The cold hard truth is that they are the source of most of the antisemitism in Europe. Citation needed.
Yeah you can either respond to something that I said or not, but don‚Äôt just pull up and start parroting [NAME] slogans
They have my favorite reality shows too like Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Survivor.
Favorite color.
If it also ends up with them meeting [NAME] 4 horsewomen pals ([NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]), that'll be interesting.
Its nice to have time to be able to get a job and a new apartment before having to start paying back those loans.
I sure could have used that during nursing home rotations .
reaper was getting self healing from dealing all that damage
Man, [NAME] really turned insane, huh. What a shame, man...
i‚Äôm cry laughing though bc she panned it the exact same way i did when i was 15 and got a naked palette
Best way to fight it is to fight it in every way.
FUCKKNG PLEASE üôèüôèüôè
He was supposed to go to a therapist appointment but I have no idea if he actually went.
No being around non judgemental people is a very possitive benefit to leaving.
i had a weird feeling colts were gunna win the SB, should have put some money on it 
"Yup. ""Tell that to [NAME]"""
I bow to the mighty OP, this is perfect
This never gets old for me!!!!
Nice try Gillette
>It's not FSA I am not going to discuss about something, which isn't even my point. 
[NAME] for comments on matches.
wrap it as a package and take it to a bad neighborhood and leave it on someones front door step.
While I agree, that doesn't necessarily means we should take those 3 in the first 3 rounds. It really depends on the players available. 
The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage.
> I'll check those links! Have fun with it, kinsman. √Ås√°heill!
Good luck to you darling. I hope you feel strength and happiness.
It's ok he was back running in training this weekend, he should be grand for the England game
Thank you! They made me stay six days. It was not fun but it made me finally realize I need to work harder in therapy
If anyone is interested, I did a play by play of my thoughts here!
You might be able to google earth it? I dont know that area very well so I cant help at all. But thats what I would try.
Central Business District. Its where main shops are located normally in very close vicinity.
Oh [NAME] another tmi scene
There is an ingame channel called ARAM, its pretty active. Its custom games, people pick the random hero and go at it in mid. 
I love [NAME]
Right? Remember when she requested evidence of pill testing being successful? Then the stats came in from Canberra. #calledyourbluff
Didn't know you're that close of a friend.. very cool!
It's in the news. I think I read it in SFgate or maybe mercury news.
EWWW yes. This makes me shudder. All wet and gross.
talking about [NAME] i think
"Redditor proves humans are only species to be exempt from evolution by saying ""hmm nah""! Scientists stunned!"
Um, no, it wouldn't be days before anyone looked for a missing kid. Hours maybe. Not days.
And people say they'll gladly pay their taxes. As if it's voluntary.
Dark humor is like food. Teenagers love it and prefer quantity over quality.
Oh [NAME].
Because you didnt add enough context
"""You look a little older without your clothes on"" - [NAME]"
I can't be the only one who's on this sub because I love it instead of being afraid
This means bisexual
This!!! This!!! Is the definition of a choosy beggar. You give a hand and they want your arm.
Would've Been Sober For About 2 Years Now.
Obviously has played on her mind for that long... glad she apologised
Corn shells are gluten free and vegan
Blow me you feckless moron, I was out of state. 
Hahha i agree but i still want him to say sorry.
I agrew. I have also had these many times and they always have a lot of ice cream.
Everyone knows a Sith would be called [NAME]. What a terrible fan of the franchise that poser is.
I love reading positive stories!! Happy for you, OP!
Exactly right about throwing $23M at Donaldson. I mean, are we going for it this year or not? Mixed signals...
You got a friend in meeeee...
Wait a second what? The asshat found the story? Can someone teach me how to use the way back machine so i can read this?
#LIES. NO STACY CAN BE A GAMER. #RISE UP
That‚Äôs awesome man!
Definitely not lol You could probably find a better boogyman than that
Don't let your high expectations of government disappoint you.
Not out of a trash can though, surely? That'd be disgusting.
I‚Äôm a crybaby now, but I‚Äôm so happy to see happiness
Media often loses me around the point where an incredibly depressed begins the long march to happiness cause I can't imagine myself doing that
Why would there be? HOTS heroes always have been and always will be BLIZZARD heroes, not Activision
Not just bad, but actively shortens your life because you have finite energy 
That‚Äôs not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that‚Äôs a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply.
I'll do these changes. Thanks!
Meditate. You may need to seek medical help. Good luck, friend.
2 is less user friendly but it can be fun. As long as you turn chat off. And hate yourself already.
So many abrupt and unnecessary transitions with undefined lane guides to make space for ...nothing.
[NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
Oh god, How I always wish she shows up to the lonely hearts party every time I watch that episode.
FUCK LES BRUNS
You k how it's bad when a furry is roasting you
Damn....poor guy
It's also surprising that Valve released a dud game. Maybe it's time for Valve to grow up and introduce themselves to the digital communication age?
You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
YES to all of this!
I am well aware of how immature and inconsiderate men are capable of being, but thanks for the reminder. Baby.
Well, it is generating them. It has a vector space (latent space) from which you can pick out a face.
I mourn for you anti-intellectuals
The smell lasts a half hour so maybe don't go to the Policeman's Ball right after. Rye and rhubarb sounds pretty fucking mint though
black bears will run off if you yell at it. if its a grizzly, you play dead and hope it believes you. 
Bisbee is a weird place.
I mean hard to get If you don't have These mental problems, I got some from a friend and they are very useful to stop trips 
Doesn't even make sense. You don't say dollars 5 so why put the dollar sign in front
Sadistic, but not smart unfortunately. 
I love how he does the [NAME] shirt-pull because he is captain.
I‚Äôm not gonna lie guys, if we help a team break their 9-game losing streak I‚Äôm gonna be pretty upset.
I probably should have seen that... I watched it without sound, and just thought the guy was drunk.. 
This is about as close as I can get to singing IRL. It's fun.
But I want to look cute as I eat myself into immobility and an early grave. /s
I am sad to hear about your cat. Pets become like a family member. I am glad to hear you are doing better.
I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm my opinion it isn‚Äôt sweet. 
Doing X deserves Y. When you realize X = Y you finally understand life.
"anarchist, bad branding word, many people like freedom but ""anarchy"" is associated with lawless chaotic bomb throwing"
so glad we picked this guy up. was absolutely terrified when we played against him. dude was in the zone.
Most important win of the season. Awesome
ya how dare anyone like live and breathe around you. another joy of life you must be in person
> for solo players Play. Mercenary. Playlist. :)
How about What's New Pussycat? With a playing of Its Not Unusual every seventh time.
Well. I‚Äôm sick and slept through the game, that wasn‚Äôt the result I expected to wake up to lmao. What happened?
That‚Äôs gonna be a no from me, [NAME]!
Joke's on u, I already have small penis!
Improved by removing the third panel, improved by removing garfield. What can we remove that doesn't improve garfield?
I wish I could cry...
Fair enough! that's useful and relevant (if anecdotal) evidence. I whish there where good studies on all of this. :-/
You‚Äôre right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them
Wow misleading title.. Ffs
Oh boy you‚Äôre really going to trigger the ‚Äúenlightened centrists‚Äù with this contemptuous babbling.
As a non-immunocompromised person I like their stance.
Might be an overestimate at this point.
Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you
Formal stays getting turned on Edit: Why y‚Äôall downvoting lol
She‚Äôs probably very traditional. Why haven‚Äôt you tried to kiss her yet?
I swear of all the people that dislike artifact, the gwent crew is by far the most obnoxious.
Sorry, I have plans that day, week, month. Watching TV while you peruse Reddit are plans aren't they???
I like the name mummied the best so far
Happy cake day!
Daddy issues [NAME]
Yeah she looks like a real [NAME]!
Its [NAME]! Love that guy, classic example of a Solo Slooper who just tries rather than complains :)
kinda obviously satire op
Thank you. I downvote all the lies I can, if I like them or not.
GG Bois 20 more to go until 90 mother of pancakes!
Yeah that does, actually. Most of this is news to me. Thanks for actually providing some articles
[NAME] is a cute woman, A Shyster, but cute.
Anyone have a clip of [NAME]‚Äô three?
The show paid for [NAME] surprise trip didn't they?
Guy got the looks
What is up with the phone tho
Was pretty confused about a random guy having dinner with [NAME] until I read your username haha Congrats for Arctic btw!
that's awesome-sometimes getting in the shower seems like an impossible undertaking but you did it
A hockey themed one with the Looney Toons meeting the Mighty Ducks would‚Äôve been the greatest thing ever
‚ÄúI hold that the more helpless a creature, the more entitled it is to protection by man from the cruelty of man‚Äù -[NAME]
I'm excited for them, but I can understand why anyone wouldn't be. They both use the fighting styles of characters who are already in the game
Gotta hang tough
That's a great idea!
I dunno. I like her.
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. This guy missed out hard cause she's smokin' hot.
After how badly the Patriots screwed CT, how can anyone like them?
Is there such a thing as a typical case? That seems like a somewhat dangerous attitude for any doctor.
This is legit an awesome idea. There‚Äôs a reason rifles are shouldered like that. Makes it easier to stabilize it. Stability is important in photography
What a buttnoodle. Glad that ‚Äútheir‚Äù cat has a new family and that takes care of them. Thanks for sharing!
LOL, had me confused for a second. Didn't realize you had responded to another comment of mine as well. 
One of my favourite [NAME] moments
im sure it's a real slap in the face
I like [NAME] :(
Sounds like he‚Äôs just cheating on you...
No there's only one emoji.
Who the fuck is that?
That isn‚Äôt a prediction that is exactly how Crisis on infinite earths played out
Stay at home dads are awesome gender non conformists.
I love your Grandma! Good for you for not just giving in.
I almost didn't finish this stranger mission because I just *knew* it was going to be bad.
"Scream ""THIS IS FOR OPTIC"" as you finish"
Electrical malfunction... suddenly exposed.
Considering how many of this involves hiding bottles, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
I‚Äôm glad to see [NAME] finally get the big screen presence they deserve.
...But I don't think you'll find that delving into the minutiae of criticisms here will enlighten you. With respect to my STC cohorts ;-)
That‚Äôs abuse and manipulation. She trained you well. I‚Äôve lived it, brother. 
Mate none of these are accurate. I only read these articles as an excuse to get mad at something
Was looking for this comment, thank you! Every so often someone will freak out over dilated pupils and post a pic here
When you have a fever yes
Haha this dude‚Äôs from the area I‚Äôm from. He‚Äôs a local treasure
I don‚Äôt get it. Does r/sardonicast actually believe that BP is highly overrated?
"Especially after the debacle with [NAME] on ""if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."""
That moment when you can't even get mad when you realise it's another sad boring troll with nothing better to do than creating alt accounts .
"We need an update, man. What's this ""Outside"" like???"
That's not her. This is she is in the movie:
*Googles what is the third leading cause of death* Google *updated*: Measles causes by stupid people not vaccinating their children
Ha, she was probably trying to hide hers! 
They can't even really articulate what has been so bad since [NAME] took office.
And then everyone clapped and cheered.
I almost wanted to ask him if it was worth it but I had to clean up his mess.
I would be so pissed if I was part of that coaching staff. That was unbelievable.
Seriously?! These [NAME] have no common decency or respect for others suffering!
"This feels more like ""Lofi Rock"" if that exists, or even Jazz. Very interesting."
It's not better or worse, just different. 
No idea, don't see the EU budging, probably some vague clauses that have no weight.
If you would like to know more about this plant
Then I find writing of us only eating it during winter strange.
That was so fun!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüëåüëåü§≤ü§≤üôèüôèüôèüî•üî•üî•üòéüòé
I love making peoples‚Äô names verbs related to things they do!
Beautiful song and great moment in the story
Maximum silly!
what a beast
Totally understand and love this.
OH NO! LOL That'll teach ya, kid. 
I think majority of people who made WarCraft 1-TBC, Diablo 1-2 and StarCraft are no longer there.
I'm a girl and got the belt for doing something similar with another girl.
Man it's so cringy. Can't I like Classic Rock AND hip-hop? smh btw he forgot the beatles, just sayin...
And that is exactly why I never got that shit done, even though it interests me greatly. 
Well, i really can not believe that in 21 century religion can offer solution for all the problems. 
A girl bashed my then girlfriends head in with a cane, she didn't even get jail time. 
Ya, he‚Äôs a lot better. If someone maxes dlo that will be the new [NAME] contract.
I'm the plane boy! I'm the one who flies!
"If he was stuttering the words ""I sell to others and we need to do your time on."
Less frugal, right?
If only I could bake a cake...or do anything productive when I'm feeling low confidence. I just lay in my bed and stop moving.
Well one would believe they have learned their lesson regarding nuclear
I like [NAME] and I've heard good things about [NAME] (I think his name is).
Calm down satan
This exact scene, as a matter of fact, haha.
Ive just given up. Learning to become selfish.
We created these beasts unfortunately. I don't feel right blaming the [NAME] for this one.
In the 1st quarter too. I love it.
Im retarded lmao Etiz/flualp
Excuse me?
She is looking like [NAME] to me in this pic.
Did you see on ig where HER MAN offered a fake [NAME] profile use of his pj üòÇüòÇ
Found [NAME].
Sex is not a right! Porn is not a right! Viewing naked female bodies is not a god damn civil liberty!
If you‚Äôre trying to find more rationale for why you‚Äôre different, you‚Äôll just continue being different 
>the ad, which has been both criticised and applauded Applauded by non-customers. Criticized by customers.
it's why it took us so long to sign him
If [NAME] played for Chivas he would already be in talks for the NT.
It's rare to see a wholesome post here. Nice to see them nonetheless.
Hypothetical: If you were a GOP senator, who would you want to lead the caucus after [NAME] steps down or is defeated?
Why was nobody driving the damn thing? They were all in the backseat. :/
I'm still rocking my Pebble 2SE.
I just call em like I see em, [NAME]
I get told lose weight but still date ugly obese girls after cause that's what a good guy would apparently do
Oh boy yeah
I don‚Äôt know her, I just thought it was funny how the titles of that post and the post under it went so well together. 
He is [NAME]. That's the twist this soap opera needs!
Nice bosses are still just bosses here to exploit you, just to also make you feel bad for, instead of afraid of, defying them
Am I out of touch? No, it's the [NAME] who are wrong!
I'm guessing you jumped straight to being offended too fast to realize that this is ironic. that's all tongue in cheek.
Undoubtedly offensive goaltending on [NAME] here. Pistons got away with one.
That's the death mark, Looks like you've been chosen for sacrifice. Sorry bud
That‚Äôs crazy. Depending of the state you‚Äôd effectively be obligated to work for that employer.
im here for blood only whether it comes via hostage situation or police chase. a peaceful ending doesnt do it for me anymore
ah yes because that is exactly what has happened in mainstream politics.
Her parents are raising her to be a terrible person. Fantastic.
No matter what, we can all listen to *You Shook Me All Night Long* during earthquakes. 
Is this supposed to be an ice cream sundae or mashed potatoes with gravy?
I remember thinking how smart I was then. /s
Fair enough. I would suggest practice but it seems you've got that under wraps. Gd luck out there.
I still like to think the combination of alums not donating and the TA strike caused them to reverse their decision on SS.
I like your enthusiasm and yes it would be hilarious.
I like that we get to see how varied artists are.
We should strip [NAME] of his Stoney badge for being so soft.
Or you just don't understand what fascism is, the role it plays, and the material conditions that bring it about.
And for those of us older 49ers fans, they used to be division rivals too!
A hell of a player when he was at Grimsby. Hope he can pick up some minutes and goals again.
r/nba will find a way to hate.
6 and he died of cancer iirc
Saint and Eagles was the only interesting game.
Of course they do, feminists are self-absorbed pigs that just want to control everything and never be held accountable for anything.
Dear Governor of Louisana, 2009 NFCCG That is all Now take the L

Anywhere skytrain wants to expand my tax paying dollars will be ok with it.
Right. Lol Then they try to gaslight the audience. As if we cant pause and rewind.
Fucking [NAME]. It's always [NAME].
"The OP is basically saying the sb is a product on a shelf with a price tag, stating her time and body are ""commodities ""."
Lmao I‚Äôm so sorry but yet intrigued as to how it contributed to your breakup?
He dunked all the time with us. Loved the reverse two hand slam
That is really valuable thank you. Supplying stats definitely will help my writing, so thank you for the feedback
I got the unblinking eye, the one with the ribs in the dead eye slot, and the one with the hat takes a headshot
Averaging 12-14 off the bench isn‚Äôt nothing
She ate too many porgs, they‚Äôre high in fat.
This is a beautiful reply with advice that is spot on.
Exactly. You make anything happen for the sake of your kids. Nothing should stand in your way.
Thank you to share your opinion and I‚Äôll appreciate this (=
The fact you have to explain this at the third grade level is pathetic. People think somone preventing his own murder is a tragedy.
I hate that I was young enough to not remember this but old enough to remember the next Super Bowl....
Didn't watch it. I assume the invasion plan dead in the water because the UK has nukes.
here we go Mr. Detective u/Jakurton
Damn... somebody got told.
Yet, here we are, a whole sub full of people who seem interested in the stupid things incels say and do... ü§î /s
Ok what other characters is her gameplay similar to?
We will welcome you with open arms <3
Perfect dynamite moment. Rank up those buckles.
You're not [NAME]. [NAME] not Asian You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. 
Z-axis...? You mean the spontaneous propulsion system or is it something else?
Btw- I love your flair!
Someone tell [NAME] to report on these threats to journalists and the first amendment!
Wwwhhhhyyyyy do they keep forcing [NAME] down our throats. [NAME]!
I love you, brother. 
I knew her in high school- she's awesome!
So guys, we did it
Ironically, a lot of these guys don‚Äôt have skulls that racist-ass phrenology would smile on. 
Oh that‚Äôs crazy to expect that much. 10/5 years is nothing.
He doesn't know who leaked it. The guy filming it isn't the same guy that leaked it.
Absolutely nothing can go wrong.
Yeah, the robber in my comment was also 'emotionally attached' is what I meant. I don't get what your comment means lol. 
I mean New Orleans is really fun even with little to no drinking. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
Beating OSU some how lol
That would have been cool for sure
I know üò¢ it‚Äôs one of my life‚Äôs goals to see a moose in real life despite how terrified I will be lol!!
The SJW community. I hate it too cause they are the ancestors of the Civil Rights Movement who where absolutely awesome
If the alternative to you being single is with this guy, stay single.
Lol 3 likes and 15 dislikes.
my sentiment exactly
Pretty certain it was already reported a long time ago that Japan was getting the censored cut of the game.
He's so handsome
This sub can be so ridiculously cynical. It's just a pretty picture of a sign!
I secretly hoped we would lose by like 70.. 35 is not enough
I‚Äôm super proud of him. Great guy!
Thanks!!
What in the actual...
It was believable until the ‚Äúalmost got beat up after class‚Äù part
Mmmm looks like some delicious asbestos tile being rubbed there.
[NAME], WHY?!?
My hope is gone, too. Sounds like we've both tried over, and over, and over again. When do the realisations hit you?
Nothing gets by you
READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.
Immaturity at its finest
His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
I remember that! She crashed and they asked her to leave lol. That was one of my fav moments.
"Mostly shit paying jobs with more openings + older people rejoining the workforce. Ofc they will spin it as ""good"" news..."
hooooly shit thats gross. this fandom is the worst
Time is a great equalizer! So is death...but yeah let's not go there. We like things to stay alive!
Enjoyed pulling moves, if you can find it. Was a comedy very Belfast centric though. 
I figure that if it was that easy, they would have given the task to somebody paid less.
Thank you for asking questions and recognizing that there may be things that you don‚Äôt know or understand about police tactics. Seriously. Thank you.
If you abuse a dog don‚Äôt be surprised when it bites you. Something something reap what you sow.
That‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôll read it, thanks.
Wouldn't it be great if [NAME] went down with charges?
I have the darndest feeling you already know the answer.
Curious why the option is even allowed then.
Lol not gonna happen. He is just in love with [NAME]. He fell in love with her when she gave him the hand of the Queen.
"""it doesn't count if you're drunk""? Wow.. Imagine that being used as an excuse in other situations."
What kind of advice are you seeking here? I'm confused.
Sheet cake did *nothing* to you, man
Thanks dude!
well, what else is there to say other than: she truly snapped.
I feel you mate
You can't choose what genes you pass on.
This is Brokeback Mountain, isn‚Äôt it. A very different kind of smashing. OwO
I‚Äôd think it would be well seasoned. Others prefer adding black pepper too.
He‚Äôs cowering in the corner. My only pet!
Lol, I‚Äôm surprised more people didn‚Äôt catch that. Thanks for the med check! 
Women are more neurotic.
Haha just loose all your libido because of dysphoria nerd
We haven‚Äôt heard from you in a while. Hopefully you and your kids are doing well.
She is :(
Congratulations!! How are you feeling/doing these days?
The only thing wrong with her is her face. Maybe she has a giving personality?
A 31 one year old woman hitting on a 21 year man is just as grossm
Logging is pretty dangerous.
"Witness tells police he heard suspect scream ""OKAY I'LL CATCH YOU LATER THEN"" while running away from the crime scene"
My guess is that we will get it done at $9.1 for 8 years. Slightly high number now that will seem like a bargain in 4-5 years.
Stay busy with good things, hang in there. Just take it 24 hours at a time. You got this,
Alright bud, I'll be sure to do that on my nearest panic attack. Cheers
Those people don‚Äôt really write and speak like that, do they?
Thank you so much! Yes that‚Äôs what I think I‚Äôll do wait for him to make a move... the waiting part sucks. lol
He looked so sad when he was talking about how it feels to be getting criticised üò¢.
[NAME] bad, [NAME] good, updoots to the left.
Ugh. This is horrifying. Thank you for sharing.
Good luck.
I dealt drugs like FIZZLE ROCKS to help my sick mom.
That what a highlight reel moment that will be played for years and years. That game is on my rotation of games. Great game all around.
[NAME] did a YT vid and now everyone trying to be like him. Sad!
I'm pretty sure you killed me. I got killed by a pounder on a plane on that very same map 2 days ago or so lol
Hell turn you into him.
Im so hype for this game, ive been waiting for this for awhile
Orangeman = cuck

They cant see me, bc I cant see them!
I am so blessed to be a lesbian.
A beautiful poem for a beautiful thing. Happy cake day btw!
"*Not wearing makeup the next day* ""Are you okay? You look sick."""
Have some more faith in him, it sounds like your husband is trying his best.
[NAME] is way more straight forward than [NAME], she doesn't have tons of mixups and stances etc. Her strings strong but simple with limited options 
It‚Äôs perfect!
Goodness, If you carry on saying mean things like that you might just hurt my feeling.
I have no clue either
PS. I love my aunt! She‚Äôs one of the reasons I went into ‚Äúnursins.‚Äù
How is it? It was consensual. They are practically adults anyway.
Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho

[NAME] is a good basketball player
Just curious, how many supplies did you take?
it‚Äôs a 3 year cegep degree (college
[NAME] thanks dude
No. They can go through the same legal process my wife and I did before getting in that line, so they don‚Äôt get turned away.
That‚Äôs dope nice job
I wish I could too.
"In recent news [NAME] hangs ""funny clown magic man"" for sorcery and disrespecting mother Russia. "
Comes from [NAME]. I love the seduction community.
This whole thing is ridiculous, I love reddit sometimes. ... and I'm sure reddit really loves this ridiculousness too!
This is scary!
This is one of my favorite details/hidden views in the entire city.
He's transcended fuck-you-money to fuck-me-money territory
bruh literally same
I was totally expecting this
Oh sorry, i thought you were having a dig at him lol. 
[NAME]. I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôll feel the same way when it hurts to open doors when you‚Äôre 35.
yes:)
No no, you don't thank a bot you say good bot Also happy cake day
Cop: We do have a strict leash law here so you're under arrest.
This is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve read on reddit this year.
This. And Dr. [NAME] told him that he was probably the heaviest person in the entire world at the time.
MRW I'm just trying to make it through my day and someone brings up Brexit or [NAME]
Hey it's been 2 weeks, are your friends still stuck at 60-ish ranks, just gathering info on MM and such.
So for you, consent and coercion are not mutually exclusive, correct? Are they ever?
Idk why you got downvoted but heres an upvote
I especially do with with the last chapter of books. I need closure.
Lol you got us there hahahahahaha way cheaper too
From a movie point of view, [NAME] works much better, with [NAME] as their adopted kid. [NAME] dating [NAME] of course.
It's highly optimistic of [NAME] to imply that [NAME] has a plan. He must be a 'glass half full' person by nature.
Same. I want to play through it to get the platinum trophy on PS4 but it's not worth the time sink.
The shitty taste is what keeps you awake.
Huh. Didnt know the HD edition had online multiplayer.
I get what you mean but still that's like mixing ammonia and bleach, it's not gonna go out well.
I can't believe that you trusted Napolean and Kip to feed Tina.
It always felt like musical chairs in the desperation to just have a seat.
And once NYC is finally underwater, ALBANY SHALL RISE!!! MORE COAL FOR THE FIRE JETHRO, OUR DESTINY AWAITS!!!
How do you know he likes beer. Did he ever once state that he likes beer?
Marry her!
I went to a destination wedding being the only single person. Promised to never put myself in that situation again.
What does the buzz feel like?
Don't make me run! I'm full of chocolate!
Couldn't agree more.
Lifesite ‚ÄúNews‚Äù doxxed him. That website is just pure hatred distilled, it‚Äôs disgusting.
Nope, real serious disease affecting real people, including the person you first replied to.
This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
Are you kidding me? /r/subsithoughtifellfor
"Yeah seriously! I saw the controller and I thought ""don't do it, don't do it!"""
I agree with the last part. Stop getting stopgaps and sign [NAME]...
Ours go insides and zones random isles.
>complain that government can't do anything right >get elected and prove it
Worst dad ever!
I wouldn't be surprised if their confidence is so shot that they lose this control and lose 3-0
Not sure if guys like that are better or worse than regular Incels.
Thanks for taking this on. My daughter's extended family on her father's side do nothing but indulge this crap and it's undermining everything.
Wonder if it‚Äôs possible for [NAME] to engage with a polite fan in a magnanimous way.
That's what I'd hope for! Retool the D day 1, if we could find a gem at QB day 2. 
[NAME] would benefit if he could help end the broken two party system.
Of course not, but the purpose is to look a bit alien, so I'm ok with pushing the limits woth PS in such cases.
In Canada, we got rid of the penny a while ago.... I've heard few complaints. 
Petition to smite BuzzFeed and Vice off the face of the internet for the bs they post Thank you
Pretty dangerous for women, too. 40% of cops are domestic abusers. Stay safe. 
Hopefully she lives in a very vaccinated area that will protect her baby. Hopefully.
Thank you for the thoughtful advice. I was thinking of getting him a mic for his gaming habit, so your advice is timely.
Yes, he did. 
"Just sit her down and say ""are you okay? You seem to be having a hard time lately."" See what she says. Communicate. "
That Pixel art yak is so cute tho.
says you, too bad you're totally wrong.
Just give him a chance!
There are a few high cost players that will likely be leaving this year. This team could easily afford [NAME].
Ok I'm pro-vax and totally uninformed, but 7 shots in a 2-day span seems like a lot, is that normal?
[NAME] damn I love [NAME].
I hate text speak . Do you really want to dumb down your argument more than you need to?
You can likely deposit this via mobile app if you bank has one. Or an ATM.
Bottom right is the cutest
>Is this battle the fate of the galaxy or not? If nobody else cares, why should we? Nailed it.
Keep in mind that being frugal is the best place to learn about all of that.
Impact? I'm merely interested in how low you will sink.
[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] all at top tier make me happy
It's the infection trying to fight back against the antibiotics.
Figured since [NAME] is expiring and you guys are tanking it didn‚Äôt really matter
love that they're giving Spicy P a chance
What dose are you taking and how long did it take to help? I've been trying the Lazarus 50mg/ml. Not seeing any obvious improvement so far.
Yeah i miss lectures for this exact reason. Its pretty bad, but what can ya do :/
My dad has an irrational fear of the dark.
I would point to [NAME] razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
Well thee are some things we know are coming next patch. Like improvements for the bipod

it's horrid :/
29 and 39. Didn‚Äôt get to see my fathers parents for too long. I definitely got my condition from my Father.
Ouch! My hear sank. Don‚Äôt do this to me.
I'm afraid I'll pick something else.
Hoarders unite! 2388 stars here, 19 rewards, 20 by tomorrow. Highest reward was 23. No Visa card. Too tired of playing credit card roulette.
I have never seen a dog more excited than when a sled dog is about to go to work.
Why does [NAME] rarely wears his armors if he can wear them whenever he wants and as long as he wants?
I though [NAME] was the offensive guru? Why would he get an established guy who has an offense?
Sick burn. I like it.
OMG - you're my freakin' hero. And your last post had me absolutely weeping with laughter.
Did you miss the other guys link? I noticed you didn't make a comment towards him, even though he posted it around the same time.
...and? 20 year olds aren't incapable of not being hypocritical shit-stirrers?
I'm guessing [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] needs to remove that stick up her ass.
I've unlocked the wrong company truck at a truckstop.
When are you going to meet?
I'm suprised I didn't see more of these. Thanks for the support :)
i don't really feel comfortable posting there. i dont really have much reason to
Goat sighting!!
Winter isn't even that bad here.
disappointing click of the day
[NAME] doesn't really look hindered by the way she's playing and hitting. I hope she doesn't retire. [NAME] just playing amazing.
I‚Äôm downvoting because it seems like r/iamverysmart material.
This guy looks like the real life [NAME]
If there‚Äôs a pattern, yes.
Thank you! <3
Everything in here I want but all we can do is pray to [NAME] for our wishes to come true
I hate when these crooks say it ain't so cuz it isüá´üá∑üò§
It's 538 what did you expect?
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
These leaks are actually very credible. It's sad that you guys let Hate and anger blind you from enjoying the experience.
"Maybe it needs to be ""Hall of Shame"" instead of a museum."
r/vaxxhappened. Fuck you Jan.
This coming from a cleric of a religion that declares that anyone who doesn't follow it is inherently immoral...
I hope you get the job, friend. :) Best of luck!
My gf is a huge TSwift fan and loves Friends. R u tryna steal my girl pal
No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
That first one is quoting lyrics (with the addition of potato) by Dire Straits, Money for Nothing. Prooobably a troll.
if your paraphilia is public facing at any point in your life I think it's reasonable to assert that there's something wrong
I love how you worded this comment. It's like a proverb.
[NAME] was not a candidate in the presidential election.
Damn you and your facts.
Well that's hardly this other woman's problem. You come across as a bitter, immature incel, so maybe sort your attitude out before trying to attract anyone.
I am glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one. I thought wow they‚Äôre really gonna get it for this one
Of course, life get‚Äôs better. Just keep on keeping on and I hope you do change your mind. 
Yea that show was cool, unfortunately the NFL thought it was bad for the league. 
No idea at this point... found in the garage from my wife's residency many years ago... (she won't let me say HOW many years)
Om [NAME], who kets their dog fight a croc? 
Is that program reciprocal for the University of Minnesota? If so, that's pretty cool.
[NAME] is still mad at [NAME] either way.
I'll take a window seat for lmao at this.
You seem slightly sensitive... I was actually thinking we had been infiltrated by the normies
Yay, congratulations! :D
I‚Äôd like him because he is very good. But he‚Äôs not a necessity.
BUT GUIS I THOUGHT [NAME] WAS PRO GUN? This should put the final nail in anyone still foolish enough to think that.
Can you try rewording that?
But that rookie year was sick. Such a Slash fan when I was young.
No problem! I've been chillin in capture the flag for couple of days now and she is super strong and fun in this mode.
If [NAME] comes out of his cave and sees his shadow, does that mean 4 more years of [NAME]?
This is just child abuse. At least the whole food withdrawal and beatings.
I was so sad when they took SG1 off of Netflix. I guess it‚Äôs on Prime now? I need to rewatch that show.
[NAME], give us the opera album we deserve
It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
I thought he was #25?
I agree with you, I just don't believe it will happen.
This sounds nice, but then with what urgency would Congress have to end a partisan gridlock?
Let's go!
Sorry, is Russia depicted in the cartoon?
Oh, the irony,.
Thank you. I realise I have to start from scratch
Memorialising is fine but he is just spamming the sub
He literally looks like a potato
Bdo is love
I highly doubt it man. You should be in the clear.
You really get it. Your SD is a very lucky man!
Primary is what she has to worry about.
I'm sorry, do people NOT listen to [NAME] 9th while driving?
Whenever I hear about someone I haven‚Äôt previously and someone says wow really they‚Äôre a YouTube ________ I physically twitch
Because we feed the shitty ones so there is no incentive to put in effort
[NAME] has been listening to this sub.
What in the hell are you talking about? I've never said that
This made me laugh, have an upvote good sir 
That awkward when
The moral of the story is obviously you should only engage women with whom you have a prior business arrangement. I.e., whores.
He's a garbage person. It's very disappointing. I liked him so much before.
[NAME] what an asshole.
[NAME] wept.
It would be pretty epic if [NAME], the artist that did the San Bernadino '17 poster, did the cover art for the new album... 
I was scared of my room and even when I fell asleep in my bed I would sleep walk into my mom's room
Awesome comp ! What a nice treat on a winter night !
Then am I correct in assuming that you categorically oppose the ridicule of all public figures in society for the same reason?
Good luck!
I'm missing something
Yeah this bothers me. Family should be off limits, and this scene was really sad
I've been watching it recently and it is such an amazing show!
When will [NAME] learn that recycling his old favorite beliefs and takes from 2008, will not end or age well. 
I wonder if that was the original plan or if [NAME] just realized what [NAME] talked about and threw in that note to explain it.
Someone else suggested netrunner which is a card game like MtG.
Fuck the cubs
It‚Äôs like you didn‚Äôt even read the comment you‚Äôre responding to.
I like the new colors significantly better. Old ones might have been some of the worst in OWL.
damn it I was holding out for [NAME] to carry the game
Turkey bacon is some worst processed food. Enjoy
GINO!!!
here's a nice little introduction video for
The Babylon Bee article makes me worry for [NAME] comic tastes.
They're killing themselves
The perfectly timed dessert, and delicious looking, too!
Thank you! We feel hard. We just don‚Äôt express it the same way feelers or maybe just most people recognize.
Surprised there isn‚Äôt more of this lol
That is a great video
Benzos stop working after a few weeks because they‚Äôre very addictive and tolerance grows quickly. I use them occasionally but never more than twice a week.
I will let my nonexistent child die, thats all right with me!
Sounds like fun, actually?
[NAME] has some great videos on the guy. He's definitely a piece of work.
I don‚Äôt cry enough.
Damn man that‚Äôs a lot of progress. You willing to put forth another 2 and a half months getting your new character back up there?
Sometimes, a shirt is just a shirt. Do you have any reason to believe otherwise?
Ah ok, will do, and thanks!
Some graffiti can turn that really bad
This made my rainy day
Well I am happy you believe that.
Actually pretty :(( as [NAME] since the Hair is one big abomination and it could have been sooooo cool.
More along the lines of ‚ÄúI could stick that vein with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back‚Äù lol
"Will I get banned if i say ""Boy I sure do love *collapsible bed word*"""
At this rate we will be.
I stand fully corrected, thank you!
Thank you, I need it. I am currently trying to learn French, would that help ?
I find porn disgusting and boring, could this be a sign I'm asexual?
I think what's more gross is you taking a picture mid stream....
Weird flex, but ok
Woooooooooo it took long enough but the UYU boys finally did it and made the league
Back to formula!
I heard your dad went into a restaurant and ate all the food in the restaurant and they had to close the restaurant.
Sadly the minimum wage in Virginia is only $7.25 an hour so that definitely would not be enough.
Then go in loud. I did that my first playthrough
After the car already cleared them. Watch again.
you never wanna hear that but sadly people will say they love you when what they really mean is you are convenient.
Thanks a ton again, and honeslty haha im so ready to get out and have my own life for once
Cool! Glad to see some cooperation.
These look fantastic. Please go and work for the Suns, they need you more than they know.
PD would probably get us [NAME] so we would all get pump faked until you realize he got the wrong one. Exhibit A [NAME] -_-
Yep, whole different story if mom finds her favorite vibrator buzzing on the floor still.
ok, im curious to the origins of this gif. what live performance was this at?
Doesn't like hearing the truth
It didn‚Äôt even compare to migas lol. Might have some in the morning.
Man a 29 year old broner can't beat a 40 year old pressure fighter, broner sucks 
Thanks!! :)
It's not *literally* the same investigation.
Have you seen Lord's and Ladles on Netflix? It's not a competition, but the scenery and the little facts are super interesting.
Yeah that‚Äôs a bit odd, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something.
The stigma is justified. I dont care how you got it, it's still disgusting.
Wow....while I think I knew this already, I can't quite picture it. I'ma have to go rewatch those scenes. 
excuse me IS THIS AN ANALOGY
Just the name of it gives me anxiety
No, we both know you are liar. Thanks for convincing me to block you.
That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
Doordash pays less than minimum wage, no money even to buy cheesecake from the cheesecake factory after paying rent and Bills üò•
Should be best right now. Speculating on what might happen in the future is pretty pointless.
I assure you I probably didn‚Äôt.
I haven‚Äôt actually watched it. Who got featured?
I can't believe this team beat Winnipeg last week, handily too. That effort hasn't been there since. 
I have many a screenshot of blatantly false posts that my older, conservative, religious relatives share on Facebook 
Yea no shit wtf
Do you really want to bring up the Menstrual Blood Baking again? Because shit like this is how it comes up again.
You can see the regret in the eyes
That is why the us needs to repeal birthright citizenship. For national security reason.
haha I didnt remember that Rampage was there live commentating for that one, good stuff. 
The joke here is that [NAME] is the ‚Äòbaby.‚Äô
ALLL THE WAY DOWNNNN!
Don't feed into it. He knows exactly what he's doing. It's on purpose.
First impressions don't need more then a day. Not to Mention 10 raids and tons of pvp I'll be fine.
He had 2 years with full control and couldn‚Äôt get it passed...just remind them of that.
It's like calling [NAME] because he's a liar. He's waying the people are rats.
You don‚Äôt have AIDS. Put those silly condoms away!
She was so excited, oof the comment hurt
When you feel nervousness, tell yourself it's just excitement. Makes a world of difference. :)
Haha enjoy your life sweaty. Haha
[NAME] saying she works all year. Most people work all year that‚Äôs normal!!!
I wonder why don't we share this planet together as human beings instead of slaving and being like robots... [NAME]
>The only way change will happen is when the national media actually focuses on them. Precisely what a protest is aimed at engendering.
It is January after all. The yard in my house is looking horrific right now - I haven't been out in 4 months!
Unrelated but wow I‚Äôm so proud that I can read like 70-80 percent of this because I studied Chinese for 3 years. Âä†Ê≤πÔºÅÂú®‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰Ω†ÂÅö‰ªÄ‰πàÔºü
Lol. Well, I enjoyed our heart to heart either way 
Thank you so much
Im done talking to you because i can expect better response from a wall. Feel bad for you. I hope it isnt too cold in your moms basement
We dont want or deserve to win this game. Sloppy sloppy sloppy
Hahaha! Yes.
I mean you should stay subbed to Pewds for obvious reasons.
Well if you don‚Äôt enjoy fishing, lucky you, there are various other activities in this game which can net you decent cash. 
Don‚Äôt you just hate when they deforest the Sahara desert?
Wait so I shouldn't try to sell my shavers by telling my customers that they aren't good enough and could do better? Damn.
You missed Satire Saturday by 2 days
The stadium isn‚Äôt a draw, it‚Äôs using space that would have otherwise been available for more housing 
What do you mean by delicate flowers?
I used to get messages from neck fetishists a lot because I have a long neck lmao I didn't even realize that was a thing
Same thing happend to me, I still sometimes fix their things if they are polite but say screw it when they angrily shout to fix their crap.
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt expect that to be real
Weird I can relate to this but in the same time I can't relate to this
Brutal piece!
That's cute. Sincerely Nepal, 7.6
I see a 14 day old reddit account angry at liberals.
Ah u/The_White_Baron... I didn't read all of it, but glad I know the reference now
This is where the run starts boys!
Our future overlords are learning how to walk and help out around the house. Growing up so fast they are. Remember that I love you
I love it. I love those melts they do that are croissants inside out and toasted
I will upvote any gif that has [NAME] as Dr. [NAME] in it. I loved her performance in Maniac.
I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.
Oh look - it has started to snow!
My first Hawks jersey was #81. Praise be.
Holy fucking shit
A Buzzfeed article about 20 perfect pairs of boobies
Holy bait-and-switch, [NAME]. I‚Äôm so sorry, that has to be incredibly stressful to have to be around and deal with.
So we need a jewelry store and a tv show. Bet lol
ha ha LOL guys aren't we so QuIrKyyyy
good point, hadn't thought of that, thanks
"A ""kicky switch""? I'm not sure where to use that, but I'll find a way."
Start an initiative to take away cops guns since you feel so strongly about it
play chaos control if you want demolition then come back here and complain about getting spawned trapped.
Mr [NAME], tear down this thread!
Isn't this from [NAME]?
13 year old account, this guy is ancient. 
Excellent! I hope that EU countries will issue statements of support themselves too, soon. Prime opportunity to really piss into Russias breakfast for once.
Braindead people blocking lane is pure cancer. But the most horrible part of your story is that you got stuck in checkline line for 10 sore minutes.. Wow.
When I am outside for daily errands, then it sometimes is inevitable, unfortunately 
I completely agree
Some seriously embarrassingly bad fan fiction too
Thanks, the date went really well! I feel for you, it will be a while for me too. 
Stop believing everything you‚Äôre told.
 a thing, and I‚Äôve had my share of Whistle Pig Pie. I hate me 
I don‚Äôt understand the point you‚Äôre making sorry
"Now I'm just picturing you going up to another kid and going ""MAA!"""
Why not use one pick and get help needed to advance to playoffs rather get late 1st player who will be 2-3 away from roster ?
Started as regular when I was younger but has since developed into full on macro. The internet will do that to you.
I‚Äôm not attractive but thank you.
Please seek medical help
My darling, have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet? We are very worried. 
Yeah you better hope. I just switched to combat pro from standard and I gotta say my builds are üóø
Update us?
We are on the same boat mate. Im pretty sure many people did.
Assuming it is manufacturer defect, sure. A lot of times, it comes down to the owner not properly caring for their gun.
she has a fetish is my guess.
movie sucks do yourself a favor and watch the Infernal Affairs trilogy they bastardized
That +8 really made the Bucks lose the game today.
Love when [NAME] goes for those big hits
When you describe a human being as ‚Äúa walking hate crime‚Äù, good people stop listening to you.
It's probably an obvious answer, but it's bad around major cities and okay in the countryside.
Post removed. Post appears to contain or link to misleading or inaccurate information.
The real problem are all the people on the ground saying the same thing to the guy holding the sign...
What did he say about [NAME]?
Abstaining is dumb, she should‚Äôve voted no
good one. 2 one liners so far.
From what I've gathered it seems a dose is about 10-30 mg of THC, so I don't think you'll feel much.
You‚Äôre right. Thanks so much, appreciate it. 
I WILL NOT OBEY THAT ORDER, GENERAL! 
Bring on the mosquito to destroy those tired legs
Keep going! Every day you stick with it is another victory you can cherish!
It didnt fuck up his career at all. Hes got thousands of ravenous fangirls and still makes absolute bank.
Thank god I'm not dating anymore. I wouldn't want to risk some girl I'm trying to bang seeing my reddit history.
This may be one of those 'pick your battles' situations. Him not paying tithing is HUGE. I would take that as a massive victory.
Doesn't matter if hes in this sub, hes sliding into your girl's DMs rn!
Not in the slightest. Who would have guessed the [NAME] would do this LMAO.
i cant i have asthma
Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she‚Äôs just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
They claim religious persecution and no lawmaker would want to deal with that can of worms.
[NAME] is also a Vikings fan. I'd love to have him on the longboat.
Because different characters have different advantages. Why do questions like this still get asked?
Damn mods are just trying to offend everyone!
>[NAME] in a confusion night, Um, she kissed him.
Jeez I just did those for fun but good luck
> is this big news? Not really. The primary use of vit D is different.
The kid you're replying too is a known [NAME] stan lol, he's gonna argue with any narrative that [NAME] is close to [NAME].
Running a company will be the same disappointment. Your problem is unsolved.
They want to live like ordinary [NAME] and the superior suburban mainstream way of life, not like a bunch of downtown elitists. 
> Still hard Phrasing. O_o Sorry, I couldn't resist.
Just tagging along for the screenshot. As you were.
Call me biased but St Kilda's clash jersey is the best thing they've done on and off field in the last two years.
Don‚Äôt get your hopes up for new armour
To be fair, actresses who are famous enough to be stopped on the red carpet get that question at almost any formal event they go to.
This comes to mind.
deliberately getting in someone's face while they are in the middle of what would qualify as prayer is disrespect.
BOOO THIS WAS RIGGED
Honesty!! Rare
Fuck you my fortnite k/d is better bitch
That's what I was going for, but I felt like replying with /r/woooosh was too much of a cookie cutter response. 
So... I guess I'm the only one who thought she looked so much nicer after that trip to the salon?
Probably. Wouldn't be surprised if our current generation essentially lives forever...or well until something like climate change puts a stop to it.
I never said it wasn't a fighting game though in my comment you replied to I specifically say it is a fighting game.
the libertarian to fascist pipeline is real
I'm pretty sure this is the classic case of spending the time between sets laying on the equipment and texting/chapchatting/facetiming
Lucky, when I did it my nickname ended up being [NAME]
At least she's not a dirty little hamster.
Everyone started making remakes. Here is my favorite Lineage, too want, but why? People who love this game will also play it
Thank you, manüå±
Not at all. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't understand what a strawman is.
tyvm for this advice actually, i was totally bamboozled on this topic
When people protested the ACA by calling it socialist, it moved the frame of reference a bit.
Dont think i can find them in -15C but would be cool
It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone
Iunno, looks pretty Western to me.
I'll take the downvotes and agree with you. Some of the ugliest looking things I've ever seen. Absolutely disgusting aesthetic.
Ooh sorry, I didn't reread the article. I just remembered seeing it on Instagram. I'll add an edit
My bad sorry, what I meant to say is ‚Äòfor our winning season‚Äô not ‚Äòin our‚Äô.
Still, anytime I want to have sex with a man, it would qualify as a sin. 
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough to make a canon implementation of Cyvasse but it looks like there are some fan-made ones.
Well that makes sense.
I wouldn‚Äôt call Sargent Peppers underrated by any stretch of the word
"[NAME], the ""launch more satellites or threaten to sue [NAME]"" one made me lose it."
Phone calls are the ultimate nightmare !!
I passed the aftermath of this wreck on the other side of I-20. What a tragedy.
I took a nap with my boyfriend this evening. It was really sweet of him to just let me rest, you know? I feel you. 
What's the streamer's name? I want to find the aftermath of this
Good luck with that one
I really like [NAME] and [NAME] on the court together
did she actually drive one of those to school? my doubting-ass would've checked thru the windows to see what she left in.
I didn't know that newborn babies eat and breathe through an umbilical cord. TIL.
Do you have a source for this? It wouldn't surprise me but I'm curious.
We don't know for certain but every public comment has stated they are amenable to an extension
Yes, I am 100% superior to [NAME]. If you're not, I'm sorry 
You think the game is unfixably bad but since you paid $20 you think it is worth your time to follow the community?
Without the skill, or body, like seriously, not to sound badass, but I'm 14 and look bigger than this [NAME] wannabe 
TBH I would definitely wear this with my denim jacket, but I wouldn't buy a huge lathe and carving tools to make it. 
That‚Äôs how free market works
Then much of the advice here is terrible because it congratulates him on doing the entirely wrong thing.
Can anyone tell me what happened to [NAME]?
Interesting. I‚Äôm wondering if nutritional therapy might help her.
Why are the campaign finance violations ‚Äúinnocuous‚Äù? Because you think the charges are fraudulent or because your chosen team is charged with them?
It‚Äôs almost def happening and there nothing you can do about it lol
Lol looking through old posts of .53 being the year of release üòí
Fuck [NAME] for blocking funding for this for years and years. So glad it's being used to help people now
Or just use a fast weapon. He's pretty predictable once you get his patterns down.
Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.
Grammar guy, sorry, but vicarious doesn't work like that. Did you mean various? 
Apples to oranges. Your perception doesn‚Äôt automatically make it wrong.
Whoa you are on a big brain level!!
Yea I guess I did. I forget how popular the bulls brand is overall. I just hate when people call others dumb because they talk/tweet in slang.
‚ù§Ô∏è you are a strong individual and there is an amazing amount of support behind you
A crossover I never knew I needed
Silver is deadly to were wolves, witches and certain other beings. Steel burns the shit out of [NAME].
that's horrifying
You're definitly an asshole, or a troll. Maybe both.
My parents died. I wish they were someplace warm that I could visit them with their grandchild, and they could visit too.
"""Don't be stupid and be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party !"""
Why would you do something so controversial and yet so brave?
Do not defend yourself.
I ate 2 lots of rice a day, with chilli. I also had a bowl of high carb cereal. I lost 4stone. CICO, is real! 
Oh nice, that sounds convenient!
No one gives a fuck about your internet points guy
Thanking people isn't manly.
And the purse tacos!! Need that midday snack!
I'd say [NAME].
Honestly rams are my second NFC team. I wanted you to win it all since the beginning of the playoffs and I love the team even more now
Made my day!
That's interesting I can definitely relate. I ask going to ask if people are cis too but I didn't wanna confound gender with sexuality
Much appreciated comrade!
As for myself, I've very rarely do I make my day! And it's not like I do, and do it try your best.
u/-adamsmith perfect troll account name, but at least he united all of r/MLS. Thanks for teaming up, everyone.
Love yourself and be patient.
Maybe 5-10 games in the g league would help knock some rust off?
I love how defeatist we've all become.
#THIS!!! andalsothat
Mixed drinks are tastier. And I hate raw clear spirits in particular.
Still makes no sense how [NAME] beat corrupted [NAME] while [NAME] and [NAME] couldn't beat his normal version
I'm scared because we don't really have any isolation scorers right now.
Can confirm, I have 2 (but be careful as you may still be allergic to their saliva)
This makes me so happy for you ‚ô•Ô∏è I am glad you are getting the right kind of support you need!
Most non immigrants won't do farm work for peanuts either
too bad nothing came off it
[NAME] is pretty fucking scary
Yheaaa I always gave me till 35 to decide if I want a kid or not. [NAME] kicked in sooner than expected.
I love her doctor. You need to send him some chili and cornbread
Fingerprints not [NAME] or [NAME] red is [NAME] don‚Äôt just make things up now that is sad !
Are you being stupid again?
"He looks like he is GTFO after that. ""The tiger shark is second only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans.[7]"" "
I love the 90s for all the same reasons. It was so comfy and effortless! And yes!!! All evidence can remain hidden!!!
I got the feeling too. It's possible, or the ground is just rough. 
Aw no. Don't tell me you are out of epic quips to rek the trumpist incel fascist nazi?
>While Austin is a great city that should embrace its first major pro franchise, What is this conformist nonsense?
He‚Äôs better than [NAME].
I think they meant r/socialism_101 (needs an underscore). r/communism101 is also a good one.
Which guy is that again? Theres also [NAME], hyper pro military special ops guy. 
The secret is you have to ice them for ten minutes.
A bash that doesn‚Äôt guaranty anything? Isn‚Äôt that a bad thing I mean it‚Äôs one of the complaints of heard about lawbringers shove
My seven year old usually wants to change behind closed doors and her decision is respected
>The left doesn't need this kind of public displays. >i never said that explictly or implicitly **thinking emoji**
I LOVE BASKETBALL
>big dumb rodeo Them's fightin' words
If my buddy was getting his ass handed to him like this I'd laugh too. Sometimes people just deserve a little ass whoopin.
Thanks brother/sister. If I wasn‚Äôt so poor I‚Äôd gold you
Whales have excellent hearing. I couldn't imagine how it is hearing loud ass sonar.
This isn‚Äôt true right? That would be incredibly funny
Everything is a red flag to reddit. I swear you people just hate relationships
Or they saved their mom from a lifetime of fixing him... ü§ï
No. Everyone going through the temple that day -- living and for the dead -- all got the same name.
Really hope the best for him. Couldn‚Äôt stay here but hoping he keeps that girl far away from him and gets it together.
I don‚Äôt really mind pickles, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre warm and soggy and there‚Äôs 1000 of them.
oh for fuck sake [NAME]
"Man ‚Äì I love how [NAME] really lights up when she asks about [NAME] .... ""that's my boy for real, for real"". Love that."
Why does he take offense to something that you did to YOUR body? It's YOUR body. I think it's blatant disrespect from his part.
The app trio is the only thing worthwhile there. Won ton tacos +boneless wings + spinach dip and I'm a happy camper.
Tastes better? Or maybe totally worse I don‚Äôt have experience
Well poops. My friend and I want to wander and look for such things but we can't. Boo!
I watched my team get deep dicked in the natty. I understand
What an abusive piece of crap. Those poor boys won‚Äôt know how to be adults. I hope their father is in their lives.
Aw, I missed it :( . I really need to spend more time outside of the roundtable thread...
[NAME] will get injured after today or in the next one or two matches. Death, taxes and [NAME] injury.
What the fuck are you talking about
Dive into that sweet sweet goodness, buddy. View the meetup the woman being lucky to be around you, and it gets much easier.
Yeah it looks like it
Perm what? Seems like it‚Äôs like permanent virginity with a haircut lookin like that
I love the RDS.
Dude has come up big in big situations time after time. To doubt his talent and clutch ness is dumb.
Besides the fact that's it's funny she also looks like me witch makes it .5% funnier
I wish I could buy one! So cute!!!
One does not simply Steal kidneys on my watch
Not sure why [NAME] didn't foul to stop the fast break there
when all I want to do is relax and chill and all she does is bounce off the wall yapping their mouth too much.
Tell him you're scared. Tell him you love him. Get professional help for you and for him.
WHAT A SHIFT!!! Can't stop that zone.
My [NAME] accuses me of cheating all the time too when I‚Äôve been nothing but loyal. Makes me wonder if she was cheating on me too...
If your partner is so consumed by his addiction that he chose it over you, you know what to do.
Cheers, i was out of date. Things change fast!
Unfamiliar with **[NAME] neighbours** Still I live at least 75' from 2 very nice quiet and respectable peeps.
I'm starting to think you're just an idiot.
What's the point of marching for life when you don't respect those living in front of you? I'll never understand these schmucks.
Alternating between verbal abuse and neglect, nice. Why aren't you rushing to make this man a grandfather and include him more in your life? /S
Well, to be fair to this person, even though he/she sounds like a jerk, that doesn't mean any [NAME] exists or not.
yeah [NAME] was reminding [NAME] that he should remain calm and not go crazy on the last 10 seconds of every round
that sucks, good luck next time!
There's a bus to Windsor that I walk by after every game and it appears full. S/o our Windsor fans!
That's the longest dimple I've ever seen>
Massive overlap. I have been vegan for 10 years and anti birth around the same time for the reasons you note.
Does she sleep with them all at once every time they hook up?
He is sacrificing himself for our sins. [NAME] bless.
My turn should arrive this year. At least this place will allow me to leave my last words.
Great video, not the same as the gilette ad but still full of a lot of information. 
They have a huge problem with rich freaks diddling kids, that's pretty libertarian.
Never seen this. Thank you for sharing
Thanks I was wondering what the sparks from his head were about.
For the love of [NAME] do not ever link that again
Even down syndrome is a spectrum of severity. I've met several adults with ds who are more than capable of relationships and employment
Chronicles of Elyria seems interesting
How's Suzuki been so far
This is painfully fake
Or saving cows
Well I mean technically it‚Äôs not healthy anymore
Thank you soooo much üòç
This is a bad post and you should feel bad for being the author
YESSSS!! The schtick with cameras never failed to delight.
Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
I've been watching him rant about it on twitter the past few days. I'm curious what his opinion on the game is outside the minigames.
There is something wrong with a man that finds a pubescent girl attractive.
To bad they didn‚Äôt SHOOT the low lifeüò°üò°üò°üò°
You are what's ruining America
This is straight up depressing
I agree! I loved him as [NAME] and I wish the writing had been better. He's amazing.
I would really love to hear you expound on your idea of ‚Äútruth‚Äù.
When everyone is lying who are you supposed to believe ?
Wow that's not how you resolve things. Escalation is the last option.
This stressed me out
And I‚Äôm not going to wait for League Play cause these clowns at Treyarch think seeker drones and razor wire are competitive.
That one guy barley touched the car and it stoped
your mom likes to copy me cause she has no creativity just like you:
This mode is dead. Sorry :/
I‚Äôm really glad to read that ex-spouses are friends after. Good for you all!
The original Halloween movie is still the scariest film I have ever seen. Being chased by [NAME] in this game is terrifying.
5 hours late!!!!!!!!! omg.
Nah no offence taken! Just trying to keep things civil HAHAHA, it‚Äôs all good my man. 
Oh that‚Äôs actually seriously a relief, how do you know that though?
That's not really libertarianism, is it?
"Thanks to me, my grandma now refers to to [NAME] as ""the lizard""."
If your argument is that we shouldn't build bike lanes because of rare inclement weather like yesterday then you just made an argument against roads.
I want to learn this, but booze seems to make me even more silent.
Oh word. Thanks for the heads up!
This is a symptom of the main reason I don't drink or do drugs. F
You were. I gave you away to see Tool in '06.
Ain't that the truth. It has turned into one old big propaganda/commercial machine.
The Democrats do not want to give [NAME] any victory at all that is a simple reason why they oppose the wall now.
How is it racist? I fail to see how.
Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help.
Mechanics institute Joes juice joint Alabama song Helvetica
You should find that for us. Also normally higher profile guys like [NAME] don't actually participate in the senior bowl
Yo I love that game too it‚Äôs great
Cancel as soon as you can it‚Äôs far more enjoyable!!!!
So we are really going to miss the playoffs in the same season as the 10 game win streak... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE !
My new favourite bromance
Me IRL :(
I love how they all state the stupidity in the quote and the person saying it, with only a few realizing it's something [NAME] said.
You share your team-mates pain.
Haha Thank you. It got hard to choose who is with what after OSU, PSU, Michigan and Rutgers
you got me [NAME]
You assumed that I complained about wl charge. Gg. I never said anything that might help you deduce that. Dude just stfu.
What camouflage?
Lol, it seems like your projecting your own problems on me
I live in southern Ohio and my WV based phlebotomist was literally was just telling me about this today,
Lucasfilm never once said he was ancient or all powerful. [NAME] did, but that was an actor trying to build up hype for his character
[NAME], he fucked everything up so bad.....and I love him but, damn
nah. YOU will get it when you're about 20 years older.
I said that weeks ago
Nice win! Good luck on your future tournaments!
Ah yes, the United States Mutant Ninja Turtles. They would dominate every sport.
Dirt, glass, poop whatever you dont want on your feet.
better yet. cancel your subscription to Netflix and go for a walk. much better for you anyway.
[NAME] has an amazing track record. I think some people forget how innovative and unpredictable the [NAME] era offense was.
True.. but it just seems weird that of all the ways [NAME] could have died in that throne room, he was killed by being cut in half. 
This country is an absolute shithole. Our police are no better than the filth they should be catching!
It‚Äôs beautiful
Hahahaha I love this man
Wouldn't wipe my arse with it.
I understand. Sorry that happened to you. Stay strong!
I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven‚Äôt had a single complaint. I‚Äôm half way through now
No, that isn't possible. Discord hosts the call, which means any attempt at using wireshark would just show Discord's information, not yours.
"To whoever entered a flamewar with me a few months ago for saying [NAME] was dangerously underweight... Yeah. That ain't ""healthy""."
Yeah I‚Äôve also experienced that with work friends I know what you mean. Thanks! Hope it gets better for you too :)
all the time :(
Thanks for posting this.
I can‚Äôt wait
Yea that makes sense. It seems like just another ploy for attention on her end ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Imagine that rattle.. all the way back to Michigan. Enough to drive you mad
I only read the first sentence then came to comments to confirm that something about the author would be the most upvoted comment.
You literally changed someone's life for the better. You made the world a better place. Thank you for helping change the stigma against autism.
Thanks I'll give it a go. Nothing used for randoms at all? Would it be better for me to find a group to play with?
How is the JC-01 with juul pods. I've heard mixed reviews.
It's in case he suffers from amnesia and forgets his name.
It was like he suddenly realised he couldn't claim that a product both had no effects and beneficial effects at the same time
Another racist foul by the Raptors on [NAME]
Because learning another language is cultural appropriation. This people are pathetic.
RIGHT?! My mom would literally never forgive the bitch üòÇ
> that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?
MassivelyOP: really new, but can't say it's not news.
I would say the answer is better education, not disenfranchisement based on socioeconomic circumstances, but you do you I guess.
‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm missing‚Äù
Deep blue eyes look weird to me. The rest seems pretty good.
It‚Äôs going to be a very long and exhausting election season. I just hope we make it though united.
I like in Iowa. The weather part is true
Its a weird thing they do south of the border... they throw flour at each other. No idea why that's a thing.
Good job ignoring [NAME].
Woof thank goddddd I changed my flair
not having periods for sure
I should call him up so we can talk about our mutual problems.
I have a sudden urge to delete my reddit account
Didn't know it could get that cold in the US (I assume).
From barrel to a tank! Great job! :)
Sure. Let‚Äôs start with the terrorists with the biggest guns. How about Israel, or Saudi Arabia? 
Good job homie üëçüèª
I am so excited for tonight's episode! It's barely even started *_*
Oh, that makes sense, I just mostly think of janitors as employed in the private sector, even in government (independent contracting, etc.)
Hey, Is this in Portugal? I recognize the francesinha sauce. (greetings from Porto)
Op you're fine, anyone who's actually been in your situation would have reacted the same. This commentor is just trying to make you feel bad. 
Icing on a cake of sadness.
Devastating to hear of any news like this :(
I like [NAME], but this entire sequence was hilarious. Poor guy. 
Victimless crime? Fuck you! Sounds like your unrepentant for being a crippling alchoholic.
Haha I had to use an analogy that rang with the older generation as well as the connection it has to social media.
Cant you just say no when it doesnt feel right? Sleeping in same bed can help heal...after the initial shock is passed.
I know right. It feels really good when someone acknowledges your existence. I hope more moments like these come for you.
He has no side of the story or we would have heard it already.
"It the equivalent of ""stop liking things I don't like."" You don't get to control the world. Lighten up and move on. "

This girl is really hot. tight biker suit and all that.
This is a new complaint I haven't seen before... I like it.
Yep, all the mentally light-lifting folks will flock to that instead of her cautiously pushed out 70% tax rate.
Which one had to shower outside with the hose... [NAME]? That one was so sad to me
Do i just need to watch just 'some' or all of them, oh and what about his books? I gotta buy them too right?
üò°this was a scam
Dont worry, as you get older that will stop working or possibly even cause anxiety. 
I actually really like [NAME]
This is more like yesyesyesyesmeh.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need no more sisters, I got enough last year‚Äù *cut to shocked mid drag faces in the werk room*
Gotta love our *progressive* neighbors
Shootouts aren‚Äôt our strong suit. Happy to get out with a point though
Bullock and Warner are the only two dems (without an F rating from the NRA) that I could see running.
I opened reddit to masturbate then I saw this. It's hard but... it's the right thing to do Thanks! Take it easy :)
He's just getting kicks from pushing buttons. Keep fighting and never give up. It will get better eventually.
I love and stan Manila , I always will. BUT the fan base worshipping the ground she walks on is getting so irritating ngl
It was more just ‚Äúwhere did all these airpods come from?!‚Äù It was weird to me.
It's my monthly luxury. I don't go to Starbucks or eat out, I instead go to Disney lol
lol I was thinking the same hahah
Interesting, but I can't imagine it will be there long until someone steals or destroys it.
Da real MVP
what i dont understand is WHY the media hasn't yet picked up this story?? Especially with [NAME] in the zeitgeist.
I‚Äôm just here for the historic screenshot. [NAME] is going down in flames!!
I was never a huge fan of her, but if they replaced [NAME] with her that would be the best thing to ever happen to this show.
Mob mentality makes it worse. Four man SWF groups are generally, by far, the most toxic people in the game. 
Burn themall!!!!
Love her positions but I think she need to get some experience under her feet before she is ready for that level of a position.
Good thing you didn't call your niece obtuse, that could have been bad
You had sex with multiple different people on acid? Lucky mf
Ayyyyyyyyyy. Fellow INTP-er!
>They split up 5 years later after an extremely messy situation with Dr [NAME]. Very very long story. I would like to hear this story
Its not just kids being kids, stop being so naive
Our sour union
Depay being a flop at United comes to mind, so good now.
He has 3 years as first team manager, he signed the contract in November, but it doesn't matter
So having a baby you don‚Äôt want is [NAME] will, but having a baby you do want is going to put you in hell? 
Aren't we back where we started? I'd say that if you're OK with animal torture, you're a pretty cruel person.
Neither are those 6 other pairs that I am wearing!!!
Okay, thanks. Dont wanna get banned want my rewards from commendation thing.
Makes sense as [NAME] was out the last 5 games. The first 8 of the season [NAME] was sacked or pressured on nearly every dropback.
Do you not commute to work? It's still like that during rush hour traffic.
No particular sauce, I'm just kinda tired of having to search that tiny lil speck of pan for at least 2 minutes before I find it.
... and no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair
this is so niche but i still felt that shit in my bones
Apart from the flashy plating, it's probably the most famous dutch restaurant and has 3 Michelin stars. I hope they don't serve mediocre food there
It would hilarious, but also kind of sad.
shaved definitely makes things more swampy for me. I need the hair to soak up the swamp
I honestly would've sued anyway. You could have died, and all you got out of it was a guy fired?
Stick with us. If only for one more day. Then let‚Äôs try again tomorrow.
Kiss your homies good night
I like the pig because shes stealthy
I noticed that too. Maybe it pumps them up too.
Scripted but funny
it‚Äôs amazing how he is already just about my favourite skater ever.
Someone who will probably harass you for not having as much money as him.
WOW I love this photo so much! Is this recent?
Yeah, that was in Episode 1 i think when she came to free him after he got captured by [NAME]
But it is! People totally shame you for only wanting one!
She didn't need that spine.
Interesting article, terrible author. Plagued with grammatical errors.
Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence.
Not super subtle with my water tool on top though. Thank god for my backyard!
How many of you just tried to take their shirt off like this... Be honest.
Most important!!! ALWAYS AIM THE HEAD! [NAME] arrows are pretty fat woodsticks, so keep aiming on the head on long distance. Thats it
"All of your examples are legal entities established as groups. The [RELIGION] Church and LULAC are a different concept then ""the [NAME]"". "
Someone had to do it when [NAME] got cut
That‚Äôs what I think as well.
Match highlights for those interested, it was a very fun match
Dang ol Mega-Low mart on frye!
He killed... YOUNGLINGS
Because no one in this world wants to see you happy and satisfied man!
Damn i guess people shouldn't steal. Or smoke
Why do the people there lose their jobs? Not doubting you, I just don't understand those rehab centers. 
We all love to read into data without actually reading the data.
Yeah, it‚Äôs interesting how I‚Äôve had conversations on the overground but not the underground. 
Fixed That For You

might be two people on their phone. I'm guessing they had a green light at the time.
Pretty unlikely as those polls are worthless. Also there is no way GOP/Trump would have supported [NAME] over [NAME] if they thought he was the stronger of the two
Ah okay, I'm sorry lol, I'm dumb. Thanks for your response.
omg this is so cute, thank you u/Skraxx
Yes - 21 of the cases were kids
Isn't it awesome. And then they get praised for their problem solving skills and dedication.
the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity
People are idiots....sheep don't magically become independent thinkers just because their food source changes
Calm and chill
I would LOVE to be on the show!
Just a friend, chill
I hope the saints can finish this, although i think they‚Äôre gonna choke üò©. Man i hate philly
The Remini series. I love it. Horrifying and karma and righteous indignation.
Glad I'm not the only one
We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
You are not to be truffled with!!! Good luck to you!!
Its not exactly what I thought it was gonna be either, but its okay, there's a lot of food.
"I have never heard the term ""glucose guardian""! Where did that come from? I'm stealing it."
I mean, its not like they gonna ban the Donald for a while 
I wanna see [NAME] too at the ASG too!! He gotta show that [NAME] Magic with [NAME] as teammate
Getting AB for anything less than a 2nd rounder + something else definitely isn't realistic.
Another episode of idiots with guns
oh no
Oh cool. Did everything else that got listed not happen either?
Philosophy and Psychology
Seriously. The only thing that gave it away was no spelling errors.
This explains the recent uptick in bots.
Oh right I forgot [NAME] was on the show
..how is he not? better == good
Oh god yes. Top quality cringe. Thank you for sharing
Wow, that landlady sure is a piece of shit. I'd be interested in knowing how many people she has discriminated against or harassed in the past.
[NAME] thank you. Someone with a rational mind.
Imagine being upset by this
it looks like a vase to put things in!
It got tired
Think the word you‚Äôre looking for is ‚ÄòMaori‚Äô
I live in Wyoming and I had WiFi once
Totally disagree. I love this look.
I‚Äôm glad you do feel genuine, unconditional love for your own child :,)
Where about sis this it‚Äôs gorgeous. I‚Äôd love to have a piece of property with a creek. That‚Äôs my dream.
Hi, female prostitute for sex work here. Can you not with this angry and condescending attitude? Not good camaraderie, comrade.
Don't be so hard on yourself. Often, things need time. Don't beat yourself up over it. 
[NAME] was barely established waaat she really had a generic design in mk9 and we already saw this look in the comics and it looked great
Thanks! There are so many resources available. Thank you for telling me about one that actually helped you
[NAME]. [NAME].
I‚Äôm at a loss for words
Oh my [NAME] please no
Honestly this type of support sounds very shallow. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre gonna support women in any way when their babies are born.
Thanks. I‚Äôm not sure your response is a proper attempt at answering the question.
Cant you tell how sad she is from her face?
Yep, they expect you to revolve around them, but think they‚Äôre exempt from returning the favour. 
That is what we love to hear. :) We hope you enjoy the game and that we see you again soon!
I appreciate the honesty
I miss when prequel memes was ironic
Tbh I couldn't tell if he was serious or shitposting
Seriously, I‚Äôve been catching and loving this one since it first came out.
He looks like he was crying already about something and hes reacting to realizing hes on camera crying probably not his proudest moment
gotchu lol, in that case sorry you got downvoted to hell for this lol
The denials is crazy in here
This sub no longer has much in the way of standards, sadly.
What a unit
That‚Äôs an insult to special needs people everywhere.
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Either way. Lol
back to reality
This is a really lovely ends to a crappy means. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed yourself and got something out of it.
I'm shocked, shocked, to find that redditors don't read sources and stay with the info they get from the misleading titles. 
"If people think that the current migrant/refugee crisis is ""bad"", they have seen nothing."
We have the same feelings
[NAME] looked great!
One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!
My first thought.. Girl your eye makeup!
Awesome! I'd love to see some if you ever post pics :)
But aren't they the only people? Also, that's a damn nice rack and it makes me feel kinda off. Idk why.
Is that a kid directly beside her?
Hopefully this loss rejuvenated him. Im a conor fan, and even though I like khabib as well I admire some of his older philosophies 
[NAME] would say yes I think but that‚Äôs a hard pass from me
Good retort! Thank you for your contribution to the discussion.
I haven‚Äôt made a choice yet. I like them both. But why do people not like Link?
Congrats!!! Thatll be me in May and I cant freaking wait!
A 2-day old account, and this is how you decided to use your time? Trolling the teacher subreddit? Ok dude...
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Approaching doesn't work unless you are [NAME] or something. I've only seen 2 approaches in my life and both were rejections.
If you‚Äôre going to be willfully ignorant, we have nothing to discuss. Good luck clinging desperately to these antiquated ideas.
Haha, I didn't know that station existed unil I was working in E Ayrshire one day and one of the guys tild me about it.
Oh, awesome!
It didnt last long sadly
My bad, second time today I have been pulled up with have* after should. My bro slang coming through in my grammar. 
Heard Sale players yelling at the refs and nothing has come of it, seems odd to suddenly have an issue with it
So now it‚Äôs a habit to live in a country without a running government I guess!
Is this [NAME] working in retail?
This episode also had the segment where a paralized [NAME] communicates by farting. So, yes it is the worst. Lisa Goes Gaga is a close second.
This is absolutely the stupidest mock I've seen this year
> I'd love it if [NAME] called for it when he's hot but he doesn't. And *that* is the problem. That what [NAME] was saying.
Some of my fraternity brothers came over, but I‚Äôm not sure if it makes a difference 
Haha penis.
Haha! I realized that after your comment. Definitely not trying to walk in Loubs with a peg leg LOL
I'm humble.
If so, then LN payments are *not* safer than unconfirmed TXs.
Guys this team is SOOO FUN THO!!!! LIKE OMG
Loved dropping in from the crack in the ceiling and going out in a blaze of glory.
Give spanish your best effort. Youll meet girls who speak english even if its pretty rudimentary. Dance and be confident
just when you think it can't get worse...
I did that my first day of middle school (got off at high school instead) but that's probably because I'm an idiot
[NAME] why you doing this! Put that on frame buddy
Hahaha. Oh [NAME]. Way to ruin the fun lol
Sucking [NAME] pecker! They're no respect for your dignity! Suck it!!!!
Hahaha thanks. I didnt notice the spelling dammit. Edited now.
New Theory: [NAME] wanted the decoder ring so he could finally figure out how to bond with his father.
What's wrong with your cousin.
They didnt watch everton leicester yesterday. Pretty sure everyone was still drunk
"""don't protect unconfirmed TP"" ""Claim Crus day 1 so TP will be on you"" "
"I pose you this question, ""How do you know [RELIGION] is not the right religion?"""
What does your statement even mean? It's a game set in WW2, not the war itself.
When [NAME] dated the nurse just for drama with the STI....
ah maybe next time
I like the head bounce. He can ask the concussion to hold his beer, it will be strong...
lol wow missed that, it stays
Talk is cheap, let‚Äôs see it on the court. [NAME] has been an awful offensive player this season & awful is kind. 
Lol, nice try. 
Yeah. Lots of clearly marked pick up and drop off areas and still people stop in the middle of the road. I dont understand it myself.
Thank you. English is not my first langage.
Okay well we should move him to wherever he gets the most opportunity to blitz from LB while our new signee can cover behind
They gonna be some big books, don‚Äôt you worry. 
Don't tell us. Preaching to the choir. Go to the mommy subs were everyone thinks it's a great idea to breed.
Fuck your husband

I'm in phoenix today for work. The weather here is great. It's all rainy and cold in seattle this time if year.
I can feel that man's feelings and I'm crying
A Mass Effect tarot deck would be awesome! That was exactly what I thought when I saw this.
the laycount is legit buds @IAMTHESmoothOperator
So TD tried putting an invisible downvote button for real?? Didn‚Äôt stop me from downvoting their idiocy.
What a goal
Its fun to draw in an empty space.
Reality is often disappointing
Still not as bad as [NAME] not being able to figure out how to push a god damn button.
This is considered being successful at this point in their lives if you live downtown lol
I honestly loved her performance as [NAME] in Scott Pilgrim. But then again I also love Scott Pilgrim so...
Just want to say you are not alone, I have all of those same ideas. You will succeed again, without her.
As a millennial, I think millennials are childish entitled humans. 
How dare u/Reijka92 disrespect [NAME] like that!
Should of just stabbed her up tbh why let someone steal from you
Right. I‚Äôm surprised everyone thinks he‚Äôs so cute...
Couldn't happen to a nicer piece of shit.
It's super funny üòÇ
Hangry is real and it comes with a horrible vengeance at fast food places and restaurants
We'll try this... I love you man. Whoever you are I know you're good. Most of us are.
I‚Äôm doing my part!
I went to the theaters by myself just to go see it lol. I rewatched it last night too. If anybody needs a link, PM me!
I was wrong about that one part. I've edited my comment to reflect my mistake. Thanks for posting the relevant bit of the bill.
Right, but you could execute it without receiving any sort of item or skill from the animal. You could just do it.
yes. to the above number i provided :) hope it‚Äôs helpful!
Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child.
It would be interesting to know what you've learned about other sects of [RELIGION].
>a Thursday night rampage that killed the 22-year-old officer and shot up a surrounding downtown neighborhood. Not exactly a constitutional standoff with the government
do you think sanders will be back at 100% after a torn achilles?
Money can‚Äôt buy happiness, but it can make getting there a hell of a lot easier.
Ah ok, good to know thank you much!
It says new, but I feel like they should call it 'used.'
Lol did you just take the experts picks that they talked about on Action Network?
Oh shit. You‚Äôre that bet welcher aren‚Äôt you?
where else would one buy the ingredients from? Like are their dozens of ice cream suppliers?
Shutdown. Singular.
Well done! Keep it going mate. If you‚Äôre struggling reach out to whoever you can!
It's a beautiful thing! Good luck!
well, that took a dark turn
Why do people procreate, only to bring to earth a clone of themselves that's not attractive in any way. 
Sounds like there is market demand for this service. Some innovative rideshare company should take advantage.
Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
What was the first insult from [NAME] to [NAME]? I think I missed it
Yeah thank you. I think I would want to know exactly what they didn‚Äôt like so I know what I can improve on.
is your friend.
Calm down or we need to call the Senate to take further actions.
Only 5 more years to go. Can‚Äôt wait!
Happy birthday, [NAME]!
Hello there!
"Same here! I thought too long and hard about whether or not la jolla/Encinitas was known as the ""treasure coast"""
Well first, im against government period, and second im conveying this under a layer of satire to make the ideas spread more easily
Really I like the new fatalities
Aww now I can‚Äôt listen to falling down
I mean, DC metro area has ***three times*** Pittsburgh's population, so. Again, relatively, Pittsburgh's is worse.
Almost in tears watching him celebrate, true captain ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hahahahahahahaa (Sorry, that is all I can say, it does not require a more intelligible comment.) 
This girl is my hero.
That's true, and I love pitbulls, but a poorly-trained Chihuahua isn't going to rip your face off, nor are they naturally disposed to aggression. 
Screams in boner
Great shot!
I don't drink at all specifically because the next day is sheer terror.
Holy fuck. Best idea ever. Thank you.
Why the fuuuhhh
Maybe he doesn't know the tailgate fell, maybe he forgot he's an idiot.
This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
...yellow?
Not even surprised by rudi, the man has been a beast since we got him.
Lol, good luck! Hope it goes well for you (I have no idea how it‚Äôs working at all for me)
I feel like that's what they both deserve, though. Thank you for the support <3
That's the perfect intro for a panic ult.
Looks like something you'd eat in Monster Hunter
No problem, glad to help.
It makes sense to me. I am a republican in that sense but hate the GOP for the most part.
Because in a world of fake people you need strangers being mean to get an honest opinion.
No!!! I love emojis üòéüòéüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüíñüéâ
When he formally announces, that's when my big donation will drop.
Unnecessary. This was painfully obvious
Thanks, now where's eyebleacher?
Saw a video on Instagram from my friend that lives in Longmont. The snow looks so pretty. Do want.
 anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad.
My response would have been, If [NAME] sees me as unworthy, then I do believe that [NAME] would have more use for my tithings.
‚Äú[NAME] = [NAME] = [NAME]‚Äù ü§£üòÇ It truly takes a DEVOTED moron to embrace that nonsense.
Damn, super glue and band aids stat!
I'm sorry to tell you this but your mate probably touches children too. That's the only logical conclusion I can come to here.
Honestly it sounds exhausting being married to him. Maybe it will be better for you in the long run.
Let the bourgeoisie draw first blood. Let there be no confusion about who shot first, and there will be no question about who shoots last.
Pac Med building. Amazon‚Äôs headquarters was there once upon a time. Not sure what it is now. Probably medical.
When she gives you the 10 minute hangry warning
yeah you're right. i just glanced over and thought it was a swish haha
I honestly never heard about the furniture. Goes to show how much was made of it.
Now let's sit down, relax, and have a nice cool glass of turnip juice.
Is this Engraze?
[NAME] 3!
I really wish this wonderful person would run for president! <3
Do you think the kid was crazy or was the mom crazy? Or do you think it was a bit of both?
He has like a million jobs though
Good read man, sounds like a crazy time, its the worst vomiting red in front of ramdom people lmfao üòÇ
There were rumors for a long time to work out and I ended up making it smaller.
That‚Äôs not cool
The only life that needs to be ended here is the life of the guy that raped your daughter. Abortion is just medicine
want* a source on that, sorry.
OOGA BOOGA [NAME] BEHIND YOU LOOK OUT
Every single war fought on US soil
The reason I play quickmatch. I wont feel the shame..
Maybe you should fatshame him and see if the results will come full circle.
So clamshell and do massage and x-clamp? Right sided injuries are not a contraindication to resuscitative thoracotomy.
No dude! Don't you get it?! Women are like cats! /s
Everytime I get to hug someone.
Don‚Äôt worry about the baby but yes worry about your mom...
i thought you were and [NAME] too?
I just use undercrackers or crackers. Knickers/panties sounds weird when I say it
i love casual racism
The Leafs weren‚Äôt mentioned once in this article.
Naw man, I think they were everywhere in Glasgow. The trams in the City Centre had the same colour scheme aswell apparently haha
I was once married and now I live alone. Some weekends, I don‚Äôt speak to anyone and don‚Äôt go out. Pure heaven. 
You mean the festival up in the domain?
Baby, You get all the credit with your excellent research!
Having sex with a child in the room is often difficult and boring.
Thought i was already there with the terrible title.
This is fantastic
Yes, always during exam periods. And she was saying to everyone she was supportive and letting me focus on my stuff.
...And what's impressive is she managed to sell two internets before she was so rudely interrupted...maybe your Land Lady should consider telemarketing. :P
I looked closely, his left ankle does not get run over. it just lands behind the very last tire. very lucky.
Well that explains why [NAME] was able to win
[NAME] is gorgeous and so are you.
I am a 22 year old male... i hope to give mine away to a amazing girl someday...
Thank you. [NAME] killed it, earned his spot. Love my packers but sometimes people in this sub are ridiculous 
You‚Äôre gorgeous girl! üî•üòä
I haven't been much on this sub recently. Is this a common theme?? If so that's just freaky.
Ballroom Blitz. Thank me later.
Thanks, I understand what you mean, this made me feel better :)
You're FUCKING JOKING
Totally fair. All I was trying to remind everyone is don't fall in love with your crushes.
Lol I‚Äôm not a [NAME] bro. Sorry man.
Back in my day, we didn't even need language to survive! Animals just roamed around, making different sounds depending on context! 
I like picking beans with grandma.
feeling like im not normal and that im shameful and wrong and other people telling me those things are what have done this to me
Ok but what if you hire him into a management position. He makes women feel uncomfortable and a discrimination suit waiting to happen.
great pass wiggins
"Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky ""shadowban"" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh"
If you need a friend to talk to, I am open.
I was scared for that white building.
And suddenly the UK join doesn't look so bad.
Contracts & money in rtts mean absolutely nothing. Just one of the many missed opportunities year after year
She knows you only want them vaxxed so they're weaker and will be easier to seduce!!!!!
That‚Äôs so cute I wish I was that talented at drawing haha. I love art like that it‚Äôs adorable
Yes please! OwO
Not me, blue text posted it on fb airing out the guy but yeah she really handled it well 
ya - but I think the question is about using infusions to treat acute pain; not about giving dissociative doses for procedures.
That made me woozy... My head's autopsy turvy.
All I want for Christmas is a broken home
Why the fuck are you smiling for? Fuck you.
lol eat your own farts Trumpkin
His Fairy Godparents are just a hallucination created by his mind as a coping mechanism to deal with the hostile world around him.
the NT-242 is my favorite battlefront weapon, by far.
Besides the fact that he hasn't announced that he's running yet (to my knowledge), there are CONSIDERABLE problems still lingering from his last campaign.
>Ruthless Lol, only in these people's minds, she's fine.
"Tell him to run over to the patent's office and copyright the name ""Green Goblin"" and I want a quarter every time somebody says it."
Some people are so closed-minded that calling them pea-brained is a compliment. That's an original one-liner inspired by this thread.
[NAME] is happy
If I'm enjoying some fresh produce, and I hear you say >app-uh-LAY-sha Rest assured im throwing this apple at'cha.
Welcome <3
This is more what I was looking for, that‚Äôs how I figured it‚Äôd feel but I‚Äôm not super eager to find out 
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
Watching Shark Tank makes me wonder how so many people even made it out of childhood with their thought process.
Look at it this way: it's the Millennium Falcon, everyone still loves it. It's part of it's charm.
It was balanced by also adding relics , you could have some pretty cool variations in your games if they added a system similar to both !!
Reminds me of that iCarly episode for the recycle project in science class with the nuclear reactor
[NAME] who voted for [NAME] I voted for sicko mode
Signing [NAME] and [NAME] is not fucking around? Lol
I didn't find it too bad. I always favoured the 1500m and my wife is from Abu Dhabi
Don't make me talk about [NAME]... ...
Teen spirit sure ain't what it used to be...
So time to trade [NAME] for a 6th round pick then eh.
The prevailing thought is he'll be too expensive to resign. I love him as a piece on the team but he's a deal sweetener.
Maybe you can't, but plenty of other people would be able to.
[NAME] was selfish as hell. Stop with the revisionist history bs
I would vote no to a United Ireland because the Republic doesn't have a free health service and no free prescriptions
[NAME] chatting with a kid while waiting to come out for the stars of the game. What a great guy.
[NAME] is a gold digger but she‚Äôs actually a pretty cool chick
Wasn't there some sort of human Cylon orgy in The Plan or am I misremembering? Because I have bad memories of [NAME] and sexytimes.
you are delucional.
Could you make a ten hour version? I‚Äôm tired of having to replay this so often
Boy it sure is a hot one today, huh?
Just out of curiousity, how does 4:3 stretched look on a 21:9 monitor
as superficially as possible. i cant go deep with a guy, only with girls.
This is weirdly funny to me
Epiploic Appendagitis. Although it‚Äôs almost certain that you‚Äôll have to affirm that you aren‚Äôt talking about appendicitis.
None that I know of. Any mental health issue needs to be cared for like any other health issue. Doctors and medications can help.
What a shame... she was passing really well too...
I always wondered what turned the deer albino. Must have been from fright.
Love your username
Funny enough, I'm a Braves fan from CT whose main football team is the saints... So I don't like this post one bit. 
I love daddy long neck and crew. You won‚Äôt be disappointed when you look it up.
But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
I've never even been to these places much less actually done this but i feel personally attacked
Adapt and overcome
Isn't this researching online?
So did my fat closet racist uncle in Nevada.
The temperatures in Oymyakon must have slowed down that GIF
What's a stream pack? Something river related I'm sure.
So she's basically repeating everything they paid CTR to say back during the primaries.
Or if he *is* you on another account... Your online self-flagellation isn't doing anyone any good.

I have started my 30 day vacation and I plan on relaxing the whole 30. Please do not make plans for me. Discuss them first with me.
Nice Map. I love the fact line 6 is pinkish red rather than silver
If hes there in the third he might be worth the pick. His tape looks atrocious tho.
I love when you get the text afterwards - my last donation apparently saved a life in Cairns! Really cheered me up actually.
Surely you've seen weirdo then? It makes me laugh Everytime haha
I‚Äôd posit that there‚Äôs a difference between espousing generalised problematic views (as [NAME] does) and directly targeting individual children
Didn't you just post this and people told you it was dumb and not meant for this sub?
The King of DoorDash. Great work as always.
If you're making a point I'm missing it
lol why would we leave the PL‚Äôs top scorer on the bench
Very interesting video. Thank you for sharing.
You sound scared
It's the only way to stop the ache.
Funny thing is, I got mine today. Maybe it'll stop tonight?
Mugging is just how we show love around here. Respect our culture.
ooohhhh when he look at the camera at the end it's the cutest shit ever
Burn it! er uh give it to your priest to burn it!
I think the fan base is mostly past that at this point. Almost everyone has MASSIVE problems with some of the decisions Nintendo makes.
[NAME] is so cute! And [NAME] is a very dashing name.
Man, KFC just ain't what it used to be. Crowder got it right again...
You‚Äôre looking at clocking out of work two hours after you should have been finished, lol.
I didn‚Äôt like him before this, now I really don‚Äôt like him. 
Arguably this post is [NAME] favorite post on Reddit one hundred percent. Lmao #muglife
In this case, I don't see a problem. OP's post can stay.
No. Or at least that‚Äôs what I suspectü§î
it's simple, it's stupid, and I can't stop laughing. 10/10
He's already dead!!!!!!!
I mean.. there's only like a million...

Spot on with the gunshot though. Just like intense temporary tinnitus.
Lots of words and said nothing. Cheers.
Good pick. I love Dream to Dream from the sequel Fievel Goes West.
It's a beautiful video of family and [NAME] finally accepting [NAME] as a brother is one of the highlights of the show
Done, good luck with your thing.
You did it!
>However, we're leaving waswas and inmoral behaviour with it! Amin and amin. 
Agree, I love her so much
Yeah me, I'm blaming my medication tho.
Loved his wife.
RemindMe! 3 weeks
Smh people aren‚Äôt seeing the real issue though. That‚Äôs the woman‚Äôs bathroom. ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Alright grandpa back in your room now
My 7 year old was so stoked to find out that there‚Äôs a place called Castle Danger in his state.
">""Fuck it Im on my way out anyway"" ""Fuck it Im on my way out to Seattle"""
Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
OHH this is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation.
The end was kinda meeeehhhh. Like Season 9 AMIRITE THX
I wish there was a way to separate the moderation function of karma from the ‚ÄúI agree with you/I don‚Äôt agree with you‚Äú.
yup, you just gotta expand the family tree with your most convenient sibling.
Let's hope that they don't miss, huh?
Native deciduous tree species or gtfo!
Having grown up at that dog park, it's definitely crowded more or less at all hours. Lots of retired folks in that area. 
I've heard how hard it is to get into nursing programs, congratulations!
Get outta here and delete your post cause you're sure gonna look dumb in front of a lot of people other than me.
I‚Äôm always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.
I am really disappointed in everyone today. Not a single murmur was mentioned. People only murmur in [NAME] world.
That guy talked bad about his haircut I guess
By all means explain to me, after reading all of that above, how I don't know. Go on... I'll wait
An Alabama DOINK!!
I expected the windows to burst. Definitely not expected THAT.
What a manipulative, child of a man. Jeez, grow up.
Mother, Grandmother, Aunts. 
Shut up, [NAME]. 
i swear on ford that the crack squad thats about to break into your house and gas you with [NAME] will make you think correctly
I love you raccoon go blazers
If there's less than four employees, this was not illegal discrimination unfortunately
aha, guilty
Wouldn‚Äôt doubt its for good reasons, just didn‚Äôt understand what the were.
Man that was a long of run on sentences but whatever.
Just in time to get excited for a mediocre Twins season!
Wow [NAME] went cold... can‚Äôt wait to see [NAME] find out why!
I can‚Äôt stand [NAME] but that was heartbreaking
Let's do the same to the throwing knife then
27 too many
I wish someone were there to scream this at me every day.
I really don‚Äôt think [NAME] will leave him. Regardless of if he‚Äôs cheating or not.
What a comeback! I was jumping around the living room the last few minutes
Don't be fatuous [NAME]
Trusting readers is something we cannot afford in this day and age.
Also the people there would love our scarlet and gold colors (I'm Chinese).
It was a dig at OP not you ahah, this video was posted there over a year ago
Ayee it made it ! Enjoy
Very sure they are metal.
Wow, you people...
You, I like you 
35k? That's just crazy. Mine was less than 2k, and that includes the wedding dress.
It seems like the problem predates the current administration, which makes me think it has more institutional roots.
Tribe member? They aren't native so that's annoying. To me, because I am. 
Really confused how every comment with more than 1 upvote says this isnt cringe and yet the post has 1.3k votes...?
My Ping Pong Queen looks so happy! I cried lol
I like you. Yes, you.
Yeah the last one made me laugh
Which views conflict? That's a really important part. Do you still consider yourself Orthodox? Do you want to be Orthodox?
Ok, thanks for the clarification. I don't find it compelling but I appreciate your time and patience.
Oh. Great
If this is real it‚Äôs just the best thing I‚Äôve ever come across. I‚Äôm still crying laughing after 10 minutes!
Oh same! But with [NAME]!
One of my favorite war movies ever. The cast and soundtrack are unbelievable
That would involve reading, and redhats aren't so good at that.
also Appendix: i will explode whenever i feel like it to cause you pain
Not quite sure what was really dickish about my comment aside from the seems fair part.
I'm crying right now, I don't know why. Doesn't even make me feel anything. 
It most definitely is! You‚Äôve gotta pick some up!!
Why did she get married if she did not love him? Aren't you afraid the same thing wil happen to you?
What a save!
at sunset i want to bang my wife there on the rock
It's such a relieving feeling to know you're finally gone. You never have to go back. You are so strong you got this!!
Is this coming to ps4 at same time?
How convenient /s
Maybe she recognized you and didn‚Äôt want to hear your (obviously) stupid comments.
I got news nephew, this isn‚Äôt unpopular. 
Happy birthday [NAME]!
Thought so, that kind of overt bullying disappears when you leave school, although there is still homophobes but they're more discreet about it.
Can't wait to see her looks in S11!
It's a pretty old and actually funny joke, just converted into a ragecomic. 
They used it as a political insult. Nothing about his sexual life.
If the fan doesn't work, then I'm fine with it.
You are reduced to attacking men for their biology.
of course everyones for sure ML isles lose in the S/O lol

Except it's the NFL an he can say fuck it an demand more money at anytime and I wouldn't put it past him.
Meh. If someone wants to find me, they will. Of course, they may not like what they find, or what I can do in return.
It's got what plants crave.
"lmao dana just like ""i fucking hate my nephew"""
Thanks for the info! Fellow dry eyelids , I guess I'll just keep using my usual.
The weird eyes.
Lol nice grammar
Try to be rational instead of angry.
People on Reddit barely know anything about law but they love to get riled up about the little that they do know
Could you give an example? You're basically saying that you do MC but don't really say how :P
Now you're thinking, 'I hope that's shepherd's pie in my knickers!
Sicko mode is on a whole new level, it cant be compared.
What a garbage post
I'd very much doubt many people believe there was no awareness or complicity.
What a cringeworthy load of kak this is. Wow I have no words.
Good thing I don't watch porn lol
You could have the sweetest peach in the world, and there is always someone who just doesn't like peaches.
Bruh. Same I‚Äôm sitting here wide awake barely breathing outta one nostril.trying to blow my nose every ten seconds and I thins happening
Oh [NAME] imagining this tween screaming yaaass queen at a poor drag queen made me cringe into a ball
I want a [NAME] podcast. Doesn't have to be weekly, just once in a while let him ramble about something
I have 35 children with 42 different partners and I used condoms every time.... But ya raw is heaven
This is honestly hilarious and will remain hilarious.... dare I say, forever!? Well done [NAME].
Git gud. jk Mobile sucks sometimes. If the Zebra/POA cooperate and it's a good day you can breeze through though. Keep at it.
Of course he gets you, he‚Äôs your brother. j/k
I like [NAME] but I disagree with him here. Then again it's not much surprise that a mega rich globetrotter that lives next to [NAME] would hold such views.
Not alone my friend
Where is this video on Doesn't seem to be on any of the pages I loaded.
That kid is beautiful
No problem People repost and don‚Äôt credit, so it‚Äôs a necessary evil Thanks for the feedback
Uh oh. I think I love Calabro. That was a hilarious call. Gotta love it!

I agree with your statement.
I'm a little sad that there's not actually a video called Dance of the Hillary, virus or not.
May [NAME] bless your efforts. I wish I could be there. De verdad soy Paname≈ào.
Left or center is more aesthetically pleasing than right justified.
I hope this leads to [NAME] empire going down.
You people are awful. Those are *Haggisus Australis*. They're a protected species!
58 and I still live at home.
I think this is one of my favorite Aquaria looks ever!!!
"""IT'S GET YOUR GAME ON! SAY IT RIGHT!"""

"""Thanks for showing me your red flags within the first 10 seconds of interaction."""
Does windows xp count as odd or even?
Thank you! It has its perks, but sometimes I do think to myself that I‚Äôm not where I belong haha
No way!? Ugh this just sounds painful
> Is it weird to have more sympathy for animals than humans? It's frighteningly common, so not *weird*, but it's definitely sad
Winnipeg Jets regularly have whiteouts, though I don't believe anyone paints themselves.

Lol, the delusion is strong.
Haha my cat does that as well. Had to get round door knobs.
>@teamYouTube ok and thanks
Then [NAME] insults [NAME] and he cries
She should be FIRED
Thanks, I hate constant reposts.
Why is that a concern? Their not language students nor are they part of an international language program.
Its very popular in the not comic book demographics.
Poor [NAME] doesn't deserve that!
Of course it's going backwards, people generally don't want to acknowledge men as the people that hold society on their backs.
Sometimes though, I wish I could be sad for a whole week; that would be a blessing. 
i still have yet to see one of these strawmen in real life that conservatives continuously blame for everything
Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. 
Because he/she is prejudiced.
"To be fair, it is a wild sentence. ""I have genital herpes and a BMI of 31."" As if they're related lol"

This was 90 for 7grams
Thank you so much! That‚Äôs a helpful list with a great variety!
Look at their post history, they're just spouting nonsense to get a rise out of people. Dont be the guy that falls for it, its embarassing
They probably didn't know.

Wait did he‚Äôs married with a family and tried getting in your pants?!
May [NAME] bless and keep the President... far away from us!
40's French movie girl. Bold look cotton, let's see how it plays out 
I would agree, but at the same time if it pisses off [NAME] supporters enough to keep them home in 2020, I'm all for it.
Thank you!!!!
The hat is necessary, not sure about the rosy cheeks. Maybe he went full 19th century transient cowboy immersive and has scabies or something...
We like what we like.

What a wonderful post. Such love. Thanks so much.
How does that work? If in every measurable way, its bread and wine, how can you claim its actually [NAME] body and blood?
Her parents are all for it, I made a good first impression and they're just happy that she is. Thanks :)
I think I get this reference, GradeAUnderA?

"Yeah. ""HEY ARE YOU THE DUDE FROM THE SCAM WEBSITE?"" [NAME]"
They can‚Äôt allow it because then the left would fall apart. The only way you can truly be a leftist is if you believe in lies.
Eh, 3. I don't know why. I told him this but he's afraid his life is ruined.
Huh, I wonder why the NFL doesn't have the umpire line up there anymore?

Uhhh I want someone to do this for me!
"""I wish I could just be whatever my online identity is. Where's our internet singularity, scientists?!"""
Unsure if OP is serious or just being sarcastic. I can't decide?
Sign my name to it too lol it was so awful we deserve pain and suffering for that!
[NAME] is completely delusional. She‚Äôs in extreme denial and only hears and sees what she wants to.
Mountaineering is more technical than hiking, and requires ropes and other equipment. Hiking uphill is part of hiking.
Underrated comment, my friend! Know that you made me genuinely laugh!
Omg. This is just the best ever. üíúüíúüíú
I like your honesty
imagine if this was a league youtuber. HOW TO GET FROM IRON 4 TO PLAT 1 INSTANTLY, ABUSE THIS BEFORE IT GETS FIXED!!!
All the time, and the excuse I get is that I need to visit more often otherwise I wouldn't have found out at all.
I'd be a lot more excited to see [NAME] flash the leather at 3b.
Have fun getting arrested for child porn then! Check your DM‚Äôs üòâ

This is everything! Congrats for being brave, cause I know I wouldn't be. Keep us posted on what happened
I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
That‚Äôs always my worst fear when the idea of leaving during January comes up. I wish you the best of luck in unthawing them!
No I didn‚Äôt think that, it was the way the information was presented
Yes.
But it's especially tough when its state-owned oil. A lot of Scandinavian countries had hiccups.
Why not just bring the county governments back? Let them decide where to establish regionalized schools.
I don't think WI is lean red, after 2018 I'd argue for it being either tossup or lean blue.
Your comments are nothing but rhetorical ways of telling me I'm wrong. Zero substance.

Unfortunate for him, but I'm bringing up players. >AND they can just stop being a support.
> Why create more jobs when no one is available to even take them? We could always import more people to fill those jobs.. :)
[NAME] receive the maximum sentence and her jail mates know that she kidnapped a child.
[NAME] did nothing wrong
No it's propaganda we because r/politics only presents info, true or (usually) or otherwise info that is designed to hurts conservatives and help liberals. Propaganda
Posts like these make it more and more clear how creepy [NAME] is
Another why [NAME] is so valuable moment. lol Let's go [NAME] And [NAME] has a small penis
The worst part is that neither party appears to have learned anything from this dumpster fire.
I believe this would still be a ticket if someone else sees you.
Does it have to be a pharmacy I‚Äôve went to?
Wow, I was JUST wondering what the bit characters on the show make. $250? - that‚Äôs it?!
This is honestly amazing.
He‚Äôs a coward, but no need to ruin his life. You should feel sorry for him.

Since you seem to have posted this twice, I would recommend you take this down.
I agree that all people deserve respect and to be free from harassment, intimidation, or assault.
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
The best ad placement.
You have another new follower üòä love your work!
I can appreciate that but snitches get stitches unfortunately
Conservatives never believe a word they say. They only believe they do.
As a killer main that sounds like bs, and makes me even more likely to treat 3v1 as a fun round
First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out...
What is normal? It should be tho....
Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
Those backpack leashes suddenly don't seem so bad
"""If you don't support no go zones, you are racist!"""
So glad I have a 20 minute walk to work up in the Bay Area.
Worst bit is that it keeps snowballing, and growing and suddenly it this mess you can't make sense out of or clear up
But it'll hurt
2013 was Dunk City, right? Because that was incredible 
Well ya but it's kinda too late for that unfortunately
That's way dangerous to keep then together they may break out and start feedig on the other ear buds to gain heir strength

Pffft right, next you'll tell me America isn't a representative democracy, or that England isn't a monarchy! Don't be a fool! 
The EPA allowed DuPont to use a chemical that literally kills people in their nonstick pans. They can be bought too unfortunately.
Yes, but assuming that our government right now wants students to do better might be a bad idea.
But those rich kids get to save an additional $600!!! /s

i love these wholesome stories when they appear in this sub. nice one, OP!
smell that? desperation. You can smell it.
Tread carefully , my friend. So many red flags.
The fact that you have to ask what other good games there are makes me think you don't take competitive gaming seriously in the first place...
Ahh, alright. I'd no idea hahah
He's ridiculous, I've never watched out west when he was on the Spurs. But damn. Hope He stay.
The only way this works is if [NAME] is doing the Bird Box challenge and cant see the terms of the contract.
I've learned that guys are dumb and to not listen to them about women's beauty stuffüôÑ
FREE STUFF!
i love you.
If we weren't going to sign an outfielder or [NAME] for some reason, we should have just signed [NAME]. 
Yes! I love their responses to anyone who comments. So much shade.
> The only concrete rule change was to limit underage players (usually students) total daily play time. Is that a good thing really?
True enough. I'd love more LGBT friendly horror.
Okay, that sounds like a plan, I can handle that.
sadly it would take wayyyyyy more than this to ever change custody agreements. documenting it for her own sanity is a good idea, though.
Even if [NAME] didn‚Äôt play we wouldn‚Äôt be winning sorry Just enjoy the ride and pay respect to the man who gave us our only championship
But then you missed their officiant who looks and sounds like [NAME]! ü§≠üò≥ü§£ 
Excuse me I am a very important person and I now think you're gay.
Oh my gosh!!!!!! üòÇ you poor thing! Thanks for sharing!

I gotcha, I knew you guys have still played some bball games, but I just figured your rivals were mainly Fresno State and Nevada.
Thank you for that ! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs just not me !
Well duh, he‚Äôs a scientist. So he‚Äôs probably smarter than the average anti vaxxer
I never knew this! Nuts are a total fear food for me
[NAME] was our second best hitter, [NAME] was the best
I'm just still numb.
Let's wait and see what punishment they receive before praising Israel.
O cool noworries ya I don't actually hate [NAME] he's now my favorite player for Vegas.
I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs playing the live action sonic the hedgehog
Forgot what it's like to actually not dislike one of the patients
Missed that part, but now I see where you are coming from.
[NAME], I love the Expanse so much. Next to Mindhunter, Daredevil, and Breaking Bad, I've never enjoyed a series like those 4.
Not my opinion either, but the soundtrack is easily one of the best parts of the game. It‚Äôs incredible.
Literally everywhere. There's nothing especially Texan about any of this. I heard all of this in freaking SCONSIN.
It's hard to not love guys like [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] though. 
MAKE A MORE DETAILED STORY OF THAT. ALSO MAKE UR OWN SUBREDDIT (r/amusementparkshenanigans). UR A GOOD STORYTELLER
Damn, we need healthy PGs.
What kind of dog is that on the left?! He looks like a sweet pup.
Hey, you can make baseless claims if you want. Don‚Äôt expect people to just believe you though.
I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips
Marry her....she's a keeper.
No, she is my ex from a long time ago and we are still good mates
Only good ones.
Your gf is cheating on you and your relationship is dead IMO.
Yeah no, I don't support people being questioned by police for any opinion actually, a sentiment I expect many people on here share.
Borrowed time is stupid
She clearly was too afraid to speak up.
What ocean are you on? Around these parts they are kind of barren.
So now we know what it takes to get a wall
Replace that friend with a whole pile of desillusioned friends and you might as well @me
[NAME] is scary
Don‚Äôt worry I did not disappoint your mother
Thank you! I remember that now.
Thank u!!! Im gonna try this one bless u
Another horror story - just getting on your train at the time it should have been arriving at the end destination 3 hours away.
BUT WHO WILL BUILD THE ROADS
Season 3 onward, pretty much anything with [NAME] makes me laugh. My fav character for sure. 
I hope I have your chemistry knowledge one day
Maybe it's not over for you. Is there a gym for social awkwardness?
"Throw them for a real loop and make them confused; ""We're not related just twins."""
Abusive family nice. Been there.
Really? Everything seems pretty in order to me
You da real MVP
Plead not guilty and try your luck in court.

It's good to know that I'm not the only one lol
[NAME] wanted to pull an [NAME] there! Good flashbacks!
Wow? Thanks so much for the knowledge, sir. We owe you one. 
he left his briefcase... hey, it's full of shredded newspaper!
I work in customer service, so it's inevitable.
Another day, another destiny! 
I love how there isn't a single legit trade in this thread
That's pretty much what you signed up for when you had kids.
I saw at least one user on this forum talking badly about [NAME] for missing playing time.
Oh, those dreadful things. I gave those away.
That's quite an arrangement
thanks i won't click
While we appreciate trying to help with the report function, next time either block them after or ignore them instead of getting into a fight. Thanks.
I am confusion.
Please no.
As a lifelong single person, [NAME] offends me. Feels like I'm apart of some demographic that they can live without :(
Why everyone mad i think it was a joke .people these days over sensitive my [NAME].
One can only hope this is the worst issue you ever have to deal with in life. Sheesh.
Best pen in baseball, even though I'd still take [NAME] over [NAME].
Noooo no more NEXTs anymore! They are obviously just a kid who is excited to discover music. Give them a break! :/
[NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
Thanks, i have to wake up early tomorrow ish.. i cant now but if i think of any other questions i will, ‚ù§

I don't even know. Fyi I have this disorder that made me even antisocial day by day...
Not surprised, damn that sucks. Concussions are awful.
i just came to make sure she was safe cause she said her parents gone. It can be dangerous ya know..
I love [NAME] and [NAME] we are so lucky
Looks like the map didn't render for him
It was on a washed out road in the at 2am. Which makes it even worse. They never should have been towing that vic.
It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
Child labor laws are ruining this country
Oh, I saw it. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt to see if he wound up saying the quiet part out loud.
[NAME]: I want to be where the people are... I want to see, want to see 'em dancing... 
And there I was blaming the poor black lads
He also had bipolar depression, which was a major driver in his mental states...
Yes, I've noticed it too. Or the photo of the item won't load. This company is so shameful
Did you really upload a video you took, of your own cat, to whyweretheyfilming? Seriously?
Yeah no.
I had an ex like that. I know why I couldn't function with his way of life. Totally unproductive.
Pretty good, yourself? Edited - Saw the link, hahaha... How you doin? ;)
The fact their team is stacked makes me hate them, along with [NAME] being a dirty player. Also they are in our division 
Lol I collect them too!
Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder.
I downvoted your original comment, but you've redeemed yourself with this one, lol. Have this upvote!
Thank you, I will tackle those too!
If they are [NAME] supporters who are now reaping what they sowed, the laughing is appropriate.
Hey. As long as the person I help is better off than when I first saw them, I‚Äôm happy.
Thats absolutely disgusting.
So, can we not customise weapons anymore? These all look like the ugly unique weapons in FC5 I would never use.
This just in: we‚Äôre all FAKES because of [NAME]
Her playing with fire, and getting burned. Stay strong. 
True story? Haha
We've actually got scientists working on that. If you're 23 right now and healthy, you've got a fairly good chance of not dying.

Bah! You should get it the old fashioned way! By shitposting.
Oh sorry- to be clearer, I meant everyone not on the APP looking for a scooter will get sick of seeing random scooters. 
They actually quarantined the whole subreddit damn...
Sorry man, you‚Äôre a great person and all. But margarine??? Downvoted*
Cruz Azul let go a young [NAME] because they had [NAME] higher on their goalkeeper pick lol

Keep it going. Love your hot takes on this sub.
I just wanna use all those fancy shields I keep yanking out of hoplites' hands.
Okay, but your other comment didn‚Äôt even make sense. Wasn‚Äôt sure what you were complaining about 
Didt know he was a point guard and should have 7 assists a game .
You dirty abo
I‚Äôm not sure what to make of any of this but stay strong, friend. You‚Äôll get through this eventually!
Thanks for sharing. You could definitely post some of your other tales.
*Whispers* ... ‚Äòthey are everywhere.‚Äô
Oh now that's receipts.
Where is he spewing hate? I follow him on twitter and have never seen him say anything hateful unless you consider criticism of [RELIGION] hateful.
Thanks! Tbh I just set the limit from true to false, didn't want to mess anything up by changing it. What number what you recommend?
What about fuckboi from DR? [NAME] ex. She was frauded if anyone was. Naive, but frauded.
I'm sorry. I wish I could give you more hopeful answers.
Really? Cuz hella 18 year olds with bad grades from my high school seemed to do it with ease.
That's awful. If I were a celebrity, I would probably do the same.
It was still controversial at the time which was my point.
I imagine it would be helpful for little kids who cant reach the faucet.
thank you for this, i feel less alone now. i‚Äôm glad you overshare on this stupid website :)
I wish ours was like that.

That explains why the dude in the back reacts the way he does... thank you!
My heart,,,,,,
Thank you! And i understand that one too.
It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. He did every day of his time for it, has expressed regret, and has not repeated it.
So we ARE paying him, but his 8.7M cap hit won't apply right? We should have pretty good amount of fun money for FA. 
*Agrees in [NAME].*
What are the odds it isn't someone on this list? I don't remember if the [NAME] hire was totally out of the blue or not
Of course! You deserve the recognition and exposure. Your work is extremely comforting !
I listened to this song the other day for the first time and... oh boy yeah
Kids are like pets. They just sit by a locked door and howl.
Good idea!
Should people be taken to court if they are suspicions about them killing someone?
Thank you - you may call me daddy.
It's not the thumb it's the nail I hate gahhh I can feel it catching and tearing back aaaagh
Haha I can drink to that! Cheers man!
IMO, cheaters are only sorry they got caught, not because they betrayed their spouses and had an affair. 
Better late than never.
>continually push that as fact I never once did. I responded to the corrected statistic that YOU provided.
Oh [NAME] üòç
Because I suck at lying and they will have to find out about him eventually
You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.
No, though they've been criticised for an alleged anti-gov't bias. 
This is the most fucking sensible comment I have seen in the this subbredit. Have the exact same opinion.
There are Germany radfem groups on FB? I'd love to know some names. Danke! (Can anybody PM me?)
It'd seem weird being around a handful of other players and literally everyone has a pet dog
We should move our business to India. I‚Äôd rather see us work with a flawed democracy than an outright police state.
Not predictable enough to ever pull it out at the beginning of a round
[NAME] so good. What a gem.
[NAME] was 1,003 pounds at his heaviest.
I noticed this last night when rewatching [NAME]. Her daughter was easily 400 pounds.
[NAME] I *swear*
And I barely said anything üòÇüòÇ
Sounds like a standard room and board agreement. Nothing communist about that at all.
Note to self - Stay out of the water.
Please let [NAME] live üôèüèΩ
Now, this is epic! 
It is physically impossible for [NAME] to get bad skins.
Huge office fan and I agree. [NAME] and [NAME] are annoying.
Only season 1 of sense 8 is worth watching.
Is there some scripture you could quote me? I'd like to read up on it just to be sure for myself
In the sub's defense, this guy is clearly a minority opinion being downvoted.
Waking up covered in blood is terrifying but thankfully it was just a nosebleed
How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s
I repent. I repent. Oh [NAME] [NAME], I do repent.
No prob, glad you asked the question -- hope the response above helps fast-track folks like you who are interested in donating. 
This is amazing.
He‚Äôs from Long Island
They all clapped.
Good times, good timessss lol
The classic gothic vampire. They have a certain flair and panache.
How awesome ! Of course now the baby has THREE sets of grandparents. Extra bonus presents !
This is great!
Change the channel during the NFC Playoffs? Hey did you ever pay that ticket? No? Just wondering....
Which side story? Thanks for the info!
hate to say it but nobody outside of saskatchewan has heard of [NAME] either
What exactly is the point of stating something as being a ‚Äúright aligned opinion‚Äù then?
Thanks for this.üòä I like to learn new things. #experiencematters **Themoreyouknow**üåà 
Probably has to do with that fact that she is, predictably, a [NAME]. 
Come for the [NAME]. Leave with [NAME].
Don‚Äôt let them get you down man. Nothing wrong with a cozy night at home by yourself.
The problem is not getting new players but keeping the current ones.
My favorite thing about this is that OP doesn‚Äôt clarify which item he‚Äôs so excited about.
The song must be thrilling
Tyl has got to be the most cringey, condescending thing I've seen on Reddit in a while.
Because you didn't realize MEPS was an acronym? Yeah, definitely taking anything you say to heart. Piss off depper. 
Oh I didn‚Äôt realise, sorry for my ignorance 
I remember seeing the trailer for this. I was lit when I heard [NAME]. Great movie
[NAME] was a strong candidate. I think she can win if it's an open seat race.
I had 3 last night üôà this rant was after glass #1
That's why I specified 'current attack.' I know it's gone on for ages.
Very, but I also never really liked home to begin with so it's been more of a relief.
This team is so untalented.
That was [NAME] not Slacked.
I'm not surprised to read this within the sub it's in. Bunch of knuckle dragging storm troopers WOULD be angry to see people liberate themselves. XD
You need to lable your factors or else this is indecipherable.
Definitely debt-free.
The only cringe is some of y'all obsessing over every little thing Eureka does.
It's just the reliability of a Honda. But I don't know a whole lot.
And offensively boring!
Maybe you'll get lucky and it will fall apart before they go through with it.
The guy on that wouldn‚Äôt let [NAME] touch his own boat
The username seems like a dead giveaway.
Not the point, and also I'm sure this means raider can dodge gb it.
This has already been posted on this subreddit but thanks.
[NAME] will love [NAME]. I wonder what the deal will look like if it happens.
I can finally play 'Kabhi kabhi aaditi'. Only hindi song I listen to.
Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
Next time I'll quit for sure though, just don't want to yet. But next time... 
They lost because they didn't run a leftist at all
Holy crap OP this is genius! I‚Äôll be doing this from now on as this is a big problem for me, thanks!
It‚Äôs funny how people use one good game to dismiss an argument against a player. They do the same thing with [NAME].
Greetings, fellow resident of a rectangle with a pointy bit in the corner.
This is trying way too hard. Ease up on the carefully sculpted one-liners and I might start to believe this was even partially real.
Oh yea [NAME] from Danganronpa 1 is great too, a cute hacker girl and one of my fave charas from the franchise! ‚ú®
Weird as I do know I've seen CoC waste/recycling services trucks picking up bins as early as 6:30AM.
I'm a dudes, he's a dudes, she's a dudes, we're all dudes!
Well then his whole argument is a straw man itself, because nobody advocates abortions of fully formed babies
Not really, just wanted to know why specifically you thought he was on gear. (Because I honestly don't see it)
Are you high? People go for walks while wearing clothing all the time. It's when you go without the clothes that you run into problems.
He hatet [NAME]
Hahahah this is one of the dumbest thing i ever heard. Thank you for sharing and giving me a good laugh
What a gutsy, huge win. This might be the most important win of the year thus far
It‚Äôs... METAPHORICAL!
It's so easy. Fill out the form and email it in. No bother.
No point in getting rid of Keemun for another Keemun.
‚ÄúYou‚Äù. Netflix. Thank me later. Hang in there <3
talking and words turn circle / Lens of observator bias : I m aware of it Who get me ?
Wow... congrats
I think he's probably (hopefully) more interested in the URL of the page... :D
I think the comment is highly relevant, thank you for posting it.
A too little too late comeback in the 4th. Where have I seen this before
Oh man, I forgot about that! Which episode was that from?
This hits a little too close to home
HE CAME OUT A WINNER. LOOK AT ALL DAT MONEY FOR DA HOOD. 7-0 WHEN IT COMES TO OP
getting signed by a team just because youre a girl is advantageous what do you mean?
I always find myself wondering where people are from, sometimes it is obvious though haha.
/r/nocontextpics is the truegaming of pics
Death by snu snu
I agree a million percent. People on this sub are way too emotional about ghosting in early stage dating.
His name is [NAME]. He's kinda funny, you should check out his other work.
Similar to seroquel?
Old people sure do love their cable news history
All I can say is.. good luck bro
How did limewire make money?
Actually surprised it's still going. It was fairly fun from what I remember, albeit a bit rough around the edges.
I get through a pack of tennis biscuits a week at work. Coconut bliss
Many a prick, as I recall. You could track them down but then it'd be pointless. 
I bet she‚Äôs gonna bring it. Hopefully they spend more money on the production of the season versus that Schei√üer RuVeal.
Bruh fox and heild look like the same dude
Oh gosh, I can‚Äôt wait to see how much you‚Äôve accomplished Mr. Not Retarded Criminal 
Mad respect to her for being honest. I like how they consulted a dietician for their article to confirm a diet of cocaine and tapas was unhealthy lololololol.
"""Here's your fucking well done with pink in the center [NAME], jsut like youre stupid fucking table wants!"""
I think this qualifies as r/prorevenge, honestly. Dude needs to face consequences more often, otherwise he will keep trampling over people‚Äôs boundaries.
I knew you had kids, i didnt know they were old enough join the military lol. Well happy bday to your son, dad. 
that seems like more of a food fetish considering its already cooked.
Ha, that would be a novel experience. He'd better let me deal with it.
Normally drop n roll. In this case I would remove my clothes because I doubt rolling would help.
I miss [NAME]
This is truly terrifying.
hey, that's me. Glad i'm done with the class, so much work
I like the assignments.
I come up and hug her and say good morning, usually joke around about the dog or something. Nothing negative really
Beyond nightmare!!
Hopefully they got a chance to see [NAME].
AWESOME!!!! I'M GONNA TELL MY MOM HOW EPIC THIS IS AND MAYBE SHE'LL TAKE US TO CHUCK E CHEESE!!!
Unite us. Unite the clans.
The username makes it even better, sucking a dudes toes, who is [NAME]. Man I'm jealous 
This is absolutely perfect
Happy Birthday!
Great, but we can't just assume that that's the case and allow everyone to DevientArt the whole subreddit
Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!
I love it
Welcome to the club....
This. Literally this post. This post is a good start. :)
Thanks for the info, appreciate it. 
Sorry but I don't keep up with YT celebs or drama What happened to [NAME] ?
I'm so glad you're annoyed.
But [NAME] is fine
I will not be preposition shamed. but yeah, you're right
Didn‚Äôt realize they lost it. Loved their Cooperstown collection figures.
Honestly i'm fine with any picture as long as it contains at least one dog
Because it would be beneficial to her cause if he were. [NAME] scapegoat mechanism in action.
Ah I didn‚Äôt think of that second definition of end. I like it!
SONNY-TATER!!
Really liked your law and dragon ones man. Good stuff.
Delete this. Not relevant.
Even if she was 25 this would have been weird and creepy af.
Of course! It's all good buddy! Pretty cool if that's really you!
Fiction isn't an opinion, it's a story
You asked if I verified. You set the goal post, not me.
What about white supremacist? BLM called [NAME] a white supremacist terrorist, that label is damaging and in the same lines of a neo nazi.
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
While it is unfortunate to hear that he is no longer interested, I hope that this brought some level of closure to you.
Well fuck my kids then
I always thought [NAME] wore the most adorable outfits.
We would leave ours up a long time. Cooperate decides when the come down. Maybe that's why.
"When it gushed out I caught myself saying ""ooof"" out loud"
Lol this ockanikin! I used to love coming here for summer camp when I was in cub/Boy Scouts!
He‚Äôs not going anywhere
Yeah I agree. I've seen Jacob's Ladder multiple times. Only Stay twice.
I didnt have a single black teacher in my 15 years of schooling. The area defenintly plays a part in that but it's still a bit shocking.
People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr
You can't vote here anyway so it is a moot point.
This incident happened a few years ago, before the angle. So it‚Äôs really establishing a pattern of horrible behavior. 
Yeah, [NAME] was doing a fly by at the top of the net and [NAME] stuck his head out... 
I've done it everytime never had a problem
I used this one just last night. Worked like a charm
He played in the [NAME] and [NAME] era so it‚Äôs hard to get the spotlight for those years.
Very astute observation.
"""It's not true!!! But I DETEST [NAME]!! Reddit help meeee!!!"""
The line the reviews were not positive made me laugh for some reason.
Is it Amazon brand? Genuine question as I didnt even know those existed
Of course it does. Wealth is relative, wealth means more purchasing power for you and less for the rest.
No lie I was just fucking watching the office but I paused it and am know listening to graduation and browsing this subreddit
I do have a drain beside the water heater, thanks I'll look into getting a drain pan.
Amazing, thanks for posting.
I like how she calls him racist, when he didn‚Äôt actually say anything racist.
Was that before or after the Sulphuric Sphincter show?
My grandparents were holocaust survivors. Seeing things like this and trying to comprehend the horrors that they had to endure really helps put my problems into perspective.
Cows should only be milked by their calves. That‚Äôs kind of the reason why cows produce milk.
The effect has Tyus has on ball movement for us is remarkable
"""You might feel some slight discomfort"""
What a finish
They both do! Like wow!!!
They just want to give you hugs mate.
I totally thought that this match would be a draw due to [NAME] interfering. I should never make any picks in the pick'em contest ever again.
I wanna see a video proving it's fake though
he is. he will make the Browns proud!
Were lucky we were able to get this much money back for him wish him all the best in spain
I feel attacked /s
What does /s even mean?
Is that what it's called now?
I‚Äôm sure someone in the lions thread already posted something similar. They love shitposts haha.
The drop is the best part of the rollercoaster! :)
Well for the relative dying, they can think the problem of evil is a contradiction and therefore not believe. That's legitimate
Thanks. I'm contacting them now.
Oi us cancers don‚Äôt want him either! We respectfully pass his birthday to April
That's a lot of commitment there. 10/10
Oh no.
Sorry, [NAME], but [NAME] beat you to it.
Oh what a day! What a lovely day!
Plot twist, they're all looking at a mirror because everyone there is a beautiful student
Trust me man. Don't see it. It's scarring.
Realize that no girl is perfect for you if you're not perfect for her. I feel for your disappointment tho. Keep on truckin'.
Gotcha. Given how contentious even the top-tiers are, I wanted to play it safe.
Oof that hurt
Thank you so much for all this! Nobody else seemed to understand the situation and just tell me to eat better, which I already do.
This is just where the usps facility is, i live in a completely different state lmao
Ah, the movies are fine. It's pretending they're a profoundly trascendental form of art that I find ludicrously funny.
Thank [NAME] some people are still willing to thrash brain dead idiots in the comments.
So basically the union would be a legal fiction to simply elect federal representatives jointly and nothing else? Hmm. Anything more than that would be an implausible boondoggle.
Remember, we still have freakin' Alaska
[NAME] best girl
"Without fail saying ""moist panties"" makes every woman cringe."
Kinda sad but... Okay then
At least he tried
When you insult someone you might want to start by insulting them to where they can understand what you're trying to say...who givES A fuck .
Post the shaved [NAME] bro! #1 guard all over!
lol you think you can get 21 back.
"I am truly sorry for you because that ""song"" is so awful"
Nah I‚Äôd use this so the government doesn‚Äôt know things about me or my family.
No.
Nobody is really on about anything.
Whoa, wasn't expecting a rational take on this here on reddit. Well done.
If you have a bad memory, you have to train yourself to take notes
Insomuch that I'll probably avoid any Stahly products in future :|
Playing with my friends
Oh, I see what you did... Trying to confuse me.
So the person reached over the gate from the wrong side? Is that right?
The Get Shorty show when he subs in for the guy at the table reading and destroys everybody with his skills is so good.
This was amazing
To be fair, expecting sex twice a day, every day is a little ridiculous.
Last time I tried exposure at the grocery store I ended up with eight weeks community service.
I saw this entire movie on YouTube and loved it! But it doesn‚Äôt seem to be on YouTube anymore :/
[NAME] are proof of this.
The automatic double action loophole.
You seem very angry. Maybe you should.... go jerk off.
Penis who, now?
I don‚Äôt. I only know about it from the internet. I had no idea.
"republicans and their hatred of Nordic countries are hilarious. ""Oh no some place has a much higher standard of living than us let's bash it!"""
Just explain that you stopped at Costco on the way to the ship and they only sell in bulk.
He actually broke his foot/ankle I think. Happened going down Mt. Lemmon in Tucson AZ a few weeks back.
The best reason to watch it again!! That scene with the ants was fucking fantastic, award winning worthy.
What the hell does metaphysics have to do with this? Also it‚Äôs a meme, get over yourself. 
I appreciate that you care about me. I've been thinking about you as well.
How you walk when you're in work and you are the boss.
Agreed. Reverse the story so that a girl makes her boyfriend shit his pants before going out and suddenly it's funny.
Unlubricated is the best unicorn there is :)
i got kangaroo from the meat guys over in U district at University Seafood and Poultry. they have tons of exotic stuff
Hugs hugs hugs. So many big hugs and good vibes. That's the only thing I know how to say right now.
You can't be serious
I have secret Reese‚Äôs, too!!! They‚Äôre hidden under the healthy snacks that none of the kids can see/reach anyway. 
I like [NAME] suit less the more I see it in action.
Yeah I read about what happened last week
Some people have no shame or sense of self-worth. It‚Äôs sad.
It was his time, even though I'm not complaining about how [NAME] should be avoided. thank you very much!
Wait project players magically become great without showing any improvement who would have thought!!!
He had doubts but no matter, the baby changed his life and he wouldn't abandon it no matter what :)!
That was fun
Apophenia is a symptom of mental illness and makes you prone to believing conspiracy theories and seeing connections that aren't there.
It was worth mentioning anyways, the Packers are a special kind of awful.
[NAME], let‚Äôs bring down the system faster.
Everyone makes mistakes tho... at least he only allowed 1 mistake to go for a goal
Here's a great essay by [NAME] regarding the Skripal farce that I've just run across:
What Subreddit?
Society has once again falsely made men look cold and emotionless. You're normal.
It‚Äôs a problem because that box of apparent bone fragments could literally have been found anywhere.
Damn [NAME] is KILLING it
I live here! Apparently I need to be keeping my eyes open.
You're dad's favorite? No fair!
Ah sorry [NAME], I was going to join. But your desperate posts scared me away!
It *was* pretty public.
Ah thanks. Well hopefully he can do better with [NAME].
Then getting irrationally angry when they don‚Äôt see it your way.
There's a surprising amount of [NAME] in this thread.
"Reminds me of when women get upset for ""looking at their chests"" when they have writing on the shirt... ACROSS THE CHEST...."
This should really be a libertarian/socialists for gun rights meme. I genuinely think there is a lot they have in common.
That was a sucker punch.
[NAME] was sneaky and he had to being 5' 6' at LHW, very good list! [NAME] was nasty as well!
Nice glad to hear man!
If [NAME], upon becomming Premier actually funds solar, wind or other renewable energy projects with Government of Alberta money I will eat my tuque.
Looks like a poached egg.
Thank you for ruining the [NAME] joke.
Have they nerfed the [NAME] at all since Vegas?
Let people be into things you don‚Äôt understand.
There's no doubt that [NAME] is entitled, but I don't think she's evil like [NAME]! 
Waahha, ohh, they massawaaa... STOP IT. YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN.
So good.
Welcome to non union states!
Any rap song because I hate it
I failed with my play on words. Oh well, can't win them all
Very excited for what could come from his presidency, very much not excited for the primaries.
[NAME] is super happy. Nice.
Considering I only play in a 4 man group across most games. I'm good thanks.
Sadly, the military is archaic about non-conforming relationships. :/ I wish more of these decals existed. 
I was expecting the surprise birthday, not seen this twist on the sister before. 
Ive read his and [NAME] further response and feel curious on the GoFundMe creator's authenticity butnthats just me, yay for positivity
Tell him he needs to go to rehab or he‚Äôll be kicked out.
Yeah this is what im currently witnessing with my nephew and nieces. I wish i can do something about it.
Don't read, it just gets worse! 
Happy cakeday your username is fun
These videos are legendary
Had to upvote just because of how wholesome this comment feels
Marijuana dispensary ask for thc ditalite cartridges and they might have different brands but all of them are good
Funny how the whole rape thing just vanished once he was appointed.
And get amazingly toned calves in the process! [NAME]
Finally something nice
Yeah you‚Äôre implying that someone holds the shitty opinion you just made up. Which is basically an attempt to make them look bad. Character assassination.
Happy new years!!!!
The problem is trying to find that middle ground, where there is just enough to prevent anarchy while still allowing people to pursue their desires.
> Obs streamlabs Thank you buddy, I will take a look at it now and do some testing
fucking seriously.
Love you, [NAME]
Yep. Cool story troll.
Literally every team sub says this when something negative about them is posted They dislike the hire because he wasn't exactly popular in Seattle.
And they wonder why they don't seem trustworthy. Maybe someone should tweet about it and they'd notice.
I never said yes, I just said ‚Äúthey this is vague and hard to give a response to‚Äù ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I wonder if she unliked you? That'd then make sense for the rest of it.
I made you guys say it, didnt I? Now you all can have 72 virgins inshallah.
I'm shocked. You mean to say the economic model adopted by every single financially successful country on the planet actually works? /S
Haha me too! I just told my husband they were my favs and I never thought that would happen with BOTH of them.
It's been 2 hours since OP posted the comment, hope OP alright
Yea the flash fan combo‚Äôs purpose is literally for killing one person. Idk what he‚Äôs talking about. Lmao
I'm sorry but I would've have pressed charges on the guy who kicked me in the ribs while I was being held down.
I like this man.
No. It‚Äôs creepy.
The truest.
Ayyy i‚Äôm on an antipsychotic and the weight gain is crazy. i do not have a baller myspace though :(
You have no recourse. You can always start your own fb group if you'd like.
How cool is it?!?!
Yeah. If you're a woman.
Wow. So I figure you two are both at least considerably older than me (24) and ...wow his response
It still amazes how many people on this show and family by the ton can do perfect splits lol
2015 was a year where either player could have won, and they'd have a pretty much perfect case. 
What age would that be?(I am not from the USA)
I confirm, my increased by around 20% every year for the last 3 years.
5 years for a guy who will most likely break down physically before year 3. Awesome move.
"That's encouraging. I have similar amounts of ETH and some LTC that's ""pending"" withdrawal from monday. Hoping I get it soon."
He wasn't beat over the top all season. I think the longest pass he allowed was around 20 yards.
Thank you so much. ‚ô•Ô∏è that means a lot.
Sorry this shit is happening to you. Thanks for capturing the first [NAME] in WWII. Go Coast Guard.
The angle makes it look like he's 15 feet tall, but otherwise, very good.
And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
Does it contain like 5 members like the real one? lol.
Oh no! That‚Äôs my favorite! Nothing like losing an organ to get you to eat healthier.
Bro. We‚Äôve been cursed since way before that.
Well, you've spent two hours.
Ohhh, thank you for correcting me üòä
Are you hoping to dm or play? I won't say to to a new group!
What a shit twat
I love those moments
Super glad this is now all nice and official! Really looking forward to working the NGS peeps!
If it‚Äôs so in demands why are you posting that you can only get unpaid internships
SWOOOSH!!
Haha I love this. I used to give mine phone books and my room would look just like this in a matter of hours. Crazy.
Here you go:
[NAME] getting off beat the dribble is hurting me a little inside /: Edit:words
Good for [NAME]. He deserves it.
Theres no clonazolam in that bottle that vendor sends bunk shit. Im considering suing that vendor for scamming me
Says who? Comedians can joke about anything as long as it's funny to their audience.
Wait do they really have 500 people? I've always assumed they are an indie developer group of like 20 people.
Lmao good luck tryna convince anyone you‚Äôre not just a brain washed redpiller tryna start shit just for validation :/
Oh of course!
OH NO, PARENTS ARE SUPPORTIVEüò±üò±
I'm legit posting this everywhere. It's hilarious. I've given you many chances.
And it's stopped. Training cancelled :-)
the tears of unfathomable sadness ... mmm yummy!
My 35kg ball of quivering nerves, which I am currently wearing like a tea cosy, would like to register an objection. 
An experiment.
I love it when drama comes home to roost
It's like 20,000 words about a teenager. Fucking insanity.
"Lol. I'm gonna try this with my wife. As I always have to tell myself: ""Don't 'should' on yourself."""
Damn. I'm sorry. What misery.
I'm sorry you felt alone. It's a terrible suffocating feeling of dread. I hope you are feeling better and that you are in good health
Good lord I can only hope so. Time will have to tell.
thank you maybe its just best if i forget it.
> like a fucking peregrine falcon, her and him beeline straight for her bedroom. Are they falcons or bees? Alphas don't mix metaphors.
It's so simple. Problem solved.
Dear Lord [NAME]...... loving those numbers!
Moonbeam was trash but I am sort of biased because it's 16-17 a gram in Alberta
The Guy just wanted to Make a Joke and I liked it
the 12 steps of AA are not the only rehab programs in the world.
Has any news been confirmed of whose playing [NAME]. I hope we see him soon to grasp how charasmatic he can be
Does negging ever actually work?
All of season 6 is terrible
You know what you‚Äôre right, not with risking my CC info. Good thing I was too lazy to do it right away. 
r/rantsfromretail would also like this.
Upvote for [NAME] by far my favorite player of all time. [NAME] has a top 10 hits just for himself gotta love the best part of hockey
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) you know you are. I bet its its awful being totally destroyed and embarrassed on the internet hahaha ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Why is [NAME] out? Is it a rest thing or a minor injury?
Jurisprudence fetishist gets off on technicality.
I mean, yes. But in terms of real dollars, they will still pay a lot more taxes than before.
I think he's in it. I know [NAME] is killing me on my fantasy team right now
One of the 10 most expensive buildings ever constructed in the world - is that acceptable to you?
Dice LA also has Dice Sweden employees on the team but we are wasting our time pointing it out.
I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve been having a hard time. I hope that tomorrow is not only better, but amazing. 
A pencil skirt is tight around the hips with a slit in the back, not swishy. Does that make sense?
[NAME] is a queen and y'all better treat her like one.
These are some of the lamest threatening letters I‚Äôve ever seen. She‚Äôs a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
Will do. Have a good night man.
Yup that‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt seem to realize.
It should be infinite since it was gonna link it but still chose to take around 155 hours to make.
Yeah I thought presses when I seen those too.
Good luck! If you do need to get her, you just gotta fuse together a Bicorn and a Jack Frost.
Oh my [NAME]. The hand mixer instead of forks. Shredding poultry is like my least favorite thing on Earth
Lol the fact that actual fans can't afford tickets is why there are let's go heat chants at this game
I'm sorry. Does Scholomance exist in the World of Ice and Fire?
Love that car
Thanks for the reply! I appreciate your input. Please keep me in the loop, I‚Äôd love to be more active with this if possible.
Bad angle, but ya got good features and clear skin, pretty gud
The title made me laugh so much after reading this. Glad things are going great with your wife. Many more happy years to you three (:
You've got this. Hang in there. Please keep us updated. I'm really sorry that you're dealing with this right now.
Makes no sense. What the hell are you trying to achieve ? Sound like a dumho
Shit, I guess I accidentally bought a Pay-Per-View boxing match
WE can't always have what we want. I see them losing.
Best song about [NAME] honestly, what a bop 
That looks disgusting.
Oh, right -- hospital scene faxing the sketch of [NAME]? I just realized.
And then he calls the fans crybabies for saying his movie sucked. Just take the L dude.
LOL. The one in the bed, when [NAME] is walking in with the candle. It was just awkward. 
Citation found, dumbass.
How autistic.
Happy New Year to you, too!
If [NAME] goes back to the Nationals their lineup and rotation are going to be nasty! I'm still hoping he lands outside of the division.
yo STOP going on your roof on dxm man you don't want to fall and hurt yourself
[NAME] did that to [NAME] and let's just say that didn't end to well for anyone
Emotions are temporary. That's why we have multiple different ones. If you were permanently happy, you'd never feel sadness or envy or anger again. 
It‚Äôs embarrassing to share a license with them, that‚Äôs for sure.
Yeah? I‚Äôll believe it when the Packard plant is a bigger version of the Factory at franklin
Haha that's so true!
The timing of the run
man remember when it was 1996 and I was zero years old? good times
Congrats!!
It's not even that... just string in the water.
I mean...I'm not saying they did, I'm just saying I would have...
Lol I‚Äôm sorry for your dogs ears
The two most talented receivers [NAME] had, [NAME] and [NAME], had their careers interrupted by injuries and nonsense.
Thanks, saved. Will watch it tomorrow morning :) 
I‚Äôd love it!!! Can you get it to Long Beach?
I‚Äôm tired from working hard and I want someone to snuggle me to sleep
1. Divine Speech by [NAME] and [NAME] 2. Also [NAME] book on the topic
What?! And you‚Äôre not a vegetable?! /s
Those are old concepts from either MK9 or MKX, can‚Äôt remember which.
I used to think that too, before I got over Trump Derangement Syndrome and took the red pill.
> And I can‚Äôt blame you. Whyy? They are beautiful little bugs
That is so relatable! I used to be amazing at hearing whether a parent was coming upstairs.
Because [NAME] has been active for 4 years and every time he makes an appearance at their police station [NAME] is somehow conveniently not around.
Looks like the nightingale armour from Sky rim still pretty cool tho
Great sign! We‚Äôll get them next year!!
So much lonely
The parents are ‚Äúretards‚Äù for not watching their kid near water.
People who had theirs stolen or bought a base model with crappy wheels
Thank you for the explanation! ü¶à
Don‚Äôt forget that he‚Äôs only 23 years old üëëüî•
Furthermore the kids are staying with you and wife can move out of the family home and back in with MIL.
Look at downvote_me_moreYOLO's posting history. Looks like a UofT student from the GTA. Judge the source and throttle your anger accordingly.
If you find it I'm definitely sending it to my sibling. There's a special love for the weird in my family
Lucky it wasnt a prosthetic leg, those abnormal body parts are how they get you
A jellyfish. He purposely stung himself with it.
Rare? HAHAHAHAHAHA
I need like a drawn out visual or something
I like it, but it does violate our images policy. embedding it in a standard post would be OK.
I love Dlo lol
Not only does the overbooking hurt the customers financials and time, but violations like this one put lives in danger.
"I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
There's no excuse for him not reciprocating it's pure laziness. What about a 69?
Well the non mainstream media isn't saying he's doing a good job either, just that his opponent who should be in jail. 
He drives to the basket like [NAME] used to. And can shoot the 3. And he's super clutch. Love the dude
People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
Oh cool, the new sign is up :) 
Correct but Reddit won't admit that as the reason.
Creepiest building in Chicago. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine the number of gunshot victims that have gone theough those doors and came out in a body bag.
Was he in your butt?
I draw with a wacom tablet, and I want to be an animator, maybe some game stuff down the line
Omg I am so grateful for attending your TED Talk. (Not being sarcastic, btw. This is great)
You have nothing to lose by going to the police now. They may help with the restraining order, shelter, etc.
[NAME] insists it went off the glass, i trust him!
Interesting. See, that seems much more adult. And actually makes sense. The things we do in the US man...
Okay, thanks!
I'd let him destroy me with facts and knowledge üò©üò©üò©
That's ma'am!
Even when drinking, I would remember that D is 13, not 14. Semper Nerdalis.
I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
But if I had a right to it as a member of society then I have committed no wrong.
This is a terrible idea
Hahaha, that's true for all their series.
I see why magic fans want [NAME] off their team.
The amount of hate that [RELIGION] people get in the world is absolutely staggering.
my mom caught be masturbating to dominatrix porn (i was bored of vanilla shit) LOL But porn addiction is bad because it can stop you from approaching women etc
Everybody uses your back lane. You're famous for being the local bike.
Don't attend. Don't engage. They want validation, don't give it to them.
seriously where the fuck do i find vegan motorcycle boots. its like looking for a unicorn
Google Tom Green sandwiches. It isn't the kind of thing you explain.
So the watering down continues. When will the democrats stop losing the battle before it's fought?
> But, President [NAME] can just hand out pardons for anything federal. Presidential pardons don't affect impeachments.
LPT: As soon as you wake up make a repost, your virtual internet points will make you feel better.
I have a feeling this is 99.9% of us.
Don't worry - Twitter isn't the only place I (or they) browse.
Thanks... Some days are harder than others
> Portland seems awesome from the outside, not so much once you're there. big fax here folks
He, like [NAME] and [NAME], are better in the latter halves of seasons. Let's see if he can do some damage.
It‚Äôs only missing a line that says ‚Äúwho was born in June‚Äù for absolutely no reason
How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as ‚Äúmeta commentary about the sub‚Äù and blocked.
What a complete and utter cunt.
Watching [NAME] cry made me cry. That dude worked his ass off his entire career for that moment. So well deserved.
By taking it as a nonserious game you don't need in order to enjoy and have fun with it.
He hide his tears behind that fedora
Aldi is awesome. Low prices, efficient processes, and treats its employees like people. Corporations actually done right.
I'm not sure what you're speaking of, but I suspect it may be specific to your state.
Well what is she gonna do, climb over the wall?
Ah cool. I thanks for clarifying.
Just read up on that guy, not sure he changed that much since his conversion unfortunately. 
"i dont think theyre planning beyond ""screw over them liberal educators that are ruining our children with their sjw bullshit"" themed rants"

Literally has a sign on top of the screen that says OUTFRONT...
"[NAME]: ""She seems useless"""
Just be yourself lol. Some girls find awkward/goofy cute ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Lol i highly doubt it. A third grader did that photoshop job
My pride. I'm like a roach, unsightly to look at but determined to survive 
Oh sweet! From their website I wasn't sure what age group it was geared toward.
Wtf Powerhouse Macomb is the gym I go to. I've never seen this dude there.
Our experience was much the same. We might go back for a 2nd chance, but doubtful. The brewery next door was great.
WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOU? WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
Now thats what I call praxis!
An innie?
yes Yes YES # YES
[NAME] got used to be my favorite character. This is embarrassing beyond any stretch of the imagination.
Haha epic gamer moment
125$ for all cards that have ever existed.
You all are looking at this guy reading this book, but ARE YOU SEEING HOW HAIRY THIS GUYS ARM IS?!?
Oh god, [NAME] is terrible. My kid loves it though, and Dr [NAME]
what's wrong with this guy's nose
When there is 1 in 20 posts that is remotely serious and it gets 20 upvotes Vs 1200 of those that memes get...
GO SUB TO HIM HES THE BEST
Why must you hurt me with such words?
LETS GO WE SACRAFICED ALL THOSE OPEN THREES FOR [NAME] [NAME] TO HIT THE CLUTCH THREE
I think you‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past ‚Äúwas‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhad been.‚Äù
Just take it easy son.
Wonder how the iPhones working out
Yeah agreed, it‚Äôs great to see!
I'll never forget how great [NAME] was that day.
That‚Äôs too bad, I didn‚Äôt know that.
What about a meet tomorow night (saturday night jan 12th) its supposed to be nice, just let me know and ill swing on by. üëç
KNC is [NAME] syrian political party and a manifestation of the KRG, so yes indirectly.
Bloody useless Pakistan
I‚Äôm kind of out of the loop... is THIS the big Chungus?
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the name changes had more to do with legal issues then geographical ones.
[NAME] already setting records for most nicknames in the league. There is no way to stop this kid...
Your personality comes off as really obnoxious and overbearing. Maybe your thinly-veiled desperation explains why she didn‚Äôt want to go out with you.
"He could have meant that his girlfriend is pregananant like how couples say ""we're pregananant"""
I know! So relieved.
CAN'T UPVOTE THIS MORE THAN ONCE, REDDIT PLZ FIX

Fair enough. You know him better than any of us do.

I bought milk and honey for its cover. ended up loving it anyway.
RDX. Definitely a head turner
Well thats just mean.
Good old belly penis
They had a similar panel last year. It's definitely worth a watch.
Thanks for clarifying; I've never heard this (it's not a pejorative where I live) so it's good to know.
Probably yes. Impossible to say without details. Has he tried giving the bill to his insurance?
Thank you for your advice! I really do appreciate it and will implement it as the kids get older.
Says the pedophile demanding to see photos of a nine-year-old boy in drag a month ago.
would love to know more about your experiences with them and where to find them.
My mom likes to use the word, ‚Äútripolar‚Äù for me and it‚Äôs aggravating. 
No they are not free and no they will not give u one for free. I tried.
Same here. The critical sign and the little chevron only shows up.
If I met a woman that loved me and I her, that stuff wouldnt cross my mind. Its life. You make it work. 
"Holy shit. I remember sleeping on the back window ""ledge"" in my parents' car! I haven't thought about that in years."
As far as I know that‚Äôs why the military loves it. Plus the [NAME] use it for food occasionally.
I think you didn't read the whole post. Go to the eye doctor.
We're sleep walking into, in the words of the Bank of England, a disordely Brexit. It's a bit problematic.
Edit wrong post
"""I *need* to smoke this pot because of my headaches, Tylenol doesn't work for me"" *proceeds to use Tylenol other days*"
Agree with [NAME] and yang I only really liked [NAME] for a little bit she irritated me
Oh god, going to a social event with someone and never leaving their side is me at almost every social event I go to.
Man pre ASG Yankees were absolutely fun to watch. Judge hitting that homerun was awesome
Honestly one of the strangest states politically in the US.
Bear your teeth at them and snarl like a dog
That's really the only standard of your life, whether or not it makes liberals furious? Sad.
One of the best photos I‚Äôve seen of the Arch. Breathtaking.
This is scary.
There are too many factors at play to really say that. It's still probably disappointing.
5 minutes... 300 COMMENTS! gg [NAME]
For fun!
I am curious how much he will get
not since that 9-2 pounding we put on Minn i dont think so
Cool. Good call on the passport. Our plan is to make a stop on the way from thr airport. Im suee some are open late.
Repost to ‚Äúwatch people die inside‚Äù.
But that makes even less sense. The government is having a hard time collecting taxes, therefore people are poor? 
Clearly not Cubs fans.
I'm not but there's a difference between criticism and constant, unrelenting negativity.
I find that telling the truth as much as possible makes things less complicated. I've learned to spin the truth when needed, though.
Of course it bothers you. She just admitted that something inconsequential to your relationship would be a dealbreaker.
It was a pretty shit joke that deserves it
Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. üëç
I feel personally attacked.
That'd be fun! Meet at a bar and watch the show!
Never had a cracked windshield but I also take it into the shop as soon as I see a chip.
Thank you! Not to yuck any yums, but this bloody grease stain looks like something a haunted doll would leave behind. 
I have decided to put myself first and see what happens ... some day things will be amazing
That'll be a testical festival for sure. Have fun.
What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
Also thank you for the advice.
still there is a bad perception that CT cant keep businesses from leaving.
The fuck? Come from nothing, now something doesn't matter? 
r/outoftheloop here; could you explain why this is good? I'm assuming he's a scummy shitlord.
This is caused by a downed power line discharging to the ground around it.
What's your definition of a repeater?
Thank you for your inspiration
I don't see how a NBC journalist's departure is relevant to the SCW, especially since he didn't cover Syria on the ground.
And then the oligarchs in charge will be forced to say how they really feel about America... this bizarre logic has very interesting potential.
This article wasn‚Äôt much better. The errors begin in the sixth paragraph. Thanks for sharing though!
well there is something you cant say on this sub consider this strike 1
I was getting arrested and my dog run away from home like a bullet
I love it. :D
You have too many background processes running then. This shouldn't give you a single more frame on proper setups, think about removing some stuff.
Don't date broke/jobless women. I have a job and I always offer to pay the bill or split.
They have problems for sure.But they don't have YOUR problems.
Attempts [NAME] rant -> Proceeds to attack all of East-Asia
*aggressively tells friend I love them*
YOU'RE CORRECT AND YET THEY ARE CORRECT ALSO
Yeah because what we should do is continue to be an absolute embarrassment.
[NAME] bless America
These things are so cool.
I love that
I'm not sure honestly. I think there's a fanmade audiobook but I've heard it's pretty bad. Sorry.

It's definitely that

Something is eating this poor redditor and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the injustice of society at large to accept face tattoos.
Thanks, I hate it.
I am having fun haha :D *creeper mode on* jk lol
I honestly can't remember how many things ended up in my hair for this very reason. Break out the peanut butter and conditioner, OP.
Homegirl has been my favorite since season 1. Just like [NAME] on Laguna Beach. Maybe bc they remind me of myself. üò¨üò¨üò¨üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Basically this.
Hey nice rebuttal. I got some new information out of that, thanks for that. It's all about learning. 
Fuck no i wanna kill the living shit out of [NAME]
[NAME] was only OP when it came out. [NAME] was OP for so long. I'm still happy they finally did something to her.
You can request a hand count at bottle drop, I think
Omg that sounds like a really intense experience, how'd you save yourself after the feeling of intense happiness? 
Reported *Checks mod list* u/JannisT I regret nothing
Because she's a mediocre writer who got lucky with Harry Potter and is in no way relevant unless she needlessly retcons HP.
Happy cakeday üéÇ
I was trying to make the point that the patient is still having a seizure; it's just not visible because they are paralyzed.
Omg! Sounds like [NAME] was right about calling [NAME] a weirdo! That is so so odd!
What is this fucking r/niceguys bullshit?
Ad Hominem Fallacy.
Oh thanks ^^ my bad I have been typing too much so my fingers hurt XD
It would've been pretty funny in May. Not anymore I'd say.
Thank you! I call on Monday to find out when I have court
Good to see this getting traction again. It really exposes [NAME] to be a useful idiot, and his supporters to be even dumber than that.
"Ok maybe I misunderstood your argument, so your just sayin that state's still have significant ""autonomous"" power? Because I agree with that."
FUCK TAMPA. FUCK TORONTO. WE WINNING THE MOTHERFUCKING CUP
I dunno, I've found some of my holy grail products through bloggers.
He suddenly realises that's not his house.
Doesn‚Äôt a disaster declaration at the federal level, which is a condition of FEMA funds, require the president to sign off?
Haha! It didn‚Äôt HAVE to be but I didn‚Äôt want anyone having unrealistic expectations just because I said the word ‚Äúinches‚Äù.
He does hate [NAME] though. And [NAME] gets promoted.
Because punishing the poor was why they didn't buy arguments that they should vote Remain because we're all prospering.
Thank you! I had no idea Reddit had profile pictures and I've been using for a couple of years.
THESAURUS THREW UP ON THIS COMMENT
That's scalie, loli, and gmilf at the same time
You have to remember it's just porn for people who haven't figured out how to get it for free on the internet (ie, morons)
Wasn't getting anywhere to begin with, might as well have some toxic fun with it.
big heart to do that, guy probably plays for the love of the game, and you have to respect that
I think they're all equally bad in their own way.
I‚Äôm wondering the same; something seems weird about that interpretation of the law
It's weird how quickly I agreed with you. Usually I'da been more incredulous.
Hot damn [NAME], keep punking [NAME]
Went on a trip to the Austin area. This park is nice if you haven‚Äôt been there. Subscribe if you can. Enjoy
She would betray her friends for chicken nuggets
I like the Call Her Daddy Girls and I don‚Äôt care who knows it

How dare you! Don‚Äôt you know seatbelts cause autism!
Thing is: the Kansas GOP is fractured. The kobach wing and the other wing. I don‚Äôt know where [NAME] fits.
I will check him out thank you :)
Wow those latkes look even worse than I thought they would.
Does this have any association with KPW?
I know it CAN be, but...I'm not sure, in this case.
Hell yeah, i agree ‚ò∫

If you don‚Äôt think this can happen in the US your going to be the reason it does.

Being gilded makes people‚Äôs days better. I love this.
No bullet dodged this was a traumatic event that will follow this poor thing around the rest of her life.
Cognitive Dissonance. Big problem in our society.
Loved it. Can't wait to see more.
tbh college has been a hair easier for me than high school. The worst of it is making tuition and trying to register for classes
[NAME] is getting the shit beat out of him and can't get a call
Damn. Your bed must stink
Explain how British farmers taking common aborigine land in Australia to be used as private property 'isn't rooted in colonialism'.
Don't play dumb, there are political parties that promote liberalism and conservatism as their main philosophies.
He's trying!
Can‚Äôt wait for the saas drama!!! üòÇüòÇ
Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.
Call it an ATATM (automatic teller ATM)
I blinked at the perfect moment and thought no one was going to save that man.
I hope this season [NAME] wins everything:
You are absolutely loving this and it is sickening to watch. Catch your fucking self on you spastic child.
Sorry I took so long, it‚Äôs the pangolin! It‚Äôs a crazy mammal with armor scales!
I appreciate your post, I‚Äôm just nervous is all, thank you
If we didn‚Äôt throw out offers after [NAME] himself has been all over it. Then lynch needs to get checked.
I love it! Guy in front can steer, can't propel. Guy in back can propel, but can't steer.
Oh, for the love of... The knock goes between the index and middle fingers, [NAME]!
Yeah being up by 20 every game does that unfortunately
If it's Fttn, then not much, maybe worse, because it's still using that shitty old rusted copper running through that same old leaky pit
This is how the really, really good porns start.

I'm so sorry that your partner doesn't understand that you no longer want to put hormones in your body.

This guy is desperate to be a victim everyone. We can't fix him.
This is amazing. WTF.
TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
yeah it really looks like your reading comprehension is the facepalm here from just the screenshot you‚Äôve provided.
Probably. The internet is a physically threatening place
NEVER FEAR!!! [NAME] IS HERE!!
ok thanks. i guess that's why there are none of them on reddit to respond to my inquiries lol
Pay you for what, just standing there? Done.
I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. 
There is still time.... though I dont expect anything to change as Activision dont care about the community hell neither do Treyfail
that's ok, I'll come join you someday after I've finished all the tears here so be patient ! : )
Those lines were an embarrassment today. I couldn‚Äôt not believe it.
Shit yeah. Awesome fatality!!!
I went to college to get an MRS and all I got was this lousy BS!
Document everything, get financially independent, be free. Good luck my friend.
BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.

I'd understand if it was because of his conduct, but because of money? We're the Yankees, what the fuck man
Just discovered that my bathroom at work has this spray that you put on the water before you poo and makes it not smell. Absolute game changer
People who don't rematch when it's 1 to 1.
I filed for divorce this morning. Hoping he moves out in the next day or so.
Idk if I want [NAME] back but I agree with [NAME] ONLY if he keeps playing at this level by the end of he season.
Well glad she got out of the situation safely. I would much rather NOT have to investigate and know someone is safe.
I‚Äôd say this is spot on. He‚Äôs not sorry he hurt me. He just wants me to shut up.
The village elders have not given a shit about the children for awhile now.
I mean all marxist obviously praise [NAME], and would hold meetings with [NAME].
Bee happy! ' v')
I love when the cringe comes to us.
People are paying attention to their assets? Hmmm. I don't feel sorry for them.
Every time [NAME] is in one of these things, I keep remembering that Trinity Soul exists. It was not a very memorable show. 
We mess up on a draft so we just nvr draft anymore?

Now there is no one face to face so tough is an option

This is awesome! Does anyone know if an EST version is available?
Oh boy here we go.
My man!
That seems crazy that you can't hit higher frame rates. I can hit 80fps consistent with a 1080. Something weird is going on here.
Also that college is overrated because they are or know a welder or plumber that's makes 200k .
No man don't you see!? People just change genders all the time and celebrate how fun it is! ^^^/s
Ex Novo has a great one on their menu and probably open.
Bop employee here. Not GLAD
There is nothing worth saying about that insipid shaving cream ad. I haven't seen it and nothing will convince me to change that.
Is it her turn this time?
That face too. Everything was perfect.
Thanks alot!
Would feel weird swiping right on a leftie
"I have a 17 year old friend who just googles ""memes"" to get his fix"
Well that‚Äôs just like, your opinion, man
[NAME] can‚Äôt hurt us anymore.
What the hell happened today? There must have been a pretty major disagreement.
Thanks for looking out but we will take our chances with this grave danger.
Downvoted before I realized what sub I was on
I saw it on the internet, so it must be true!
Amazing. Roasted sweet potatoes as well are dynamite
You must be new around here.
This. This is the [NAME] I've been waiting on.
Praying for the one who wrote that, that he isn't gonna caught...
So do I. But you can't just blame it all on the dude.
That is always a black box to fans too - let‚Äôs say they pull the trigger, we have no idea if any of these reports are real
Better yet, get rid of them if they are non-essential. Why are my tax dollars paying for worthless jobs?
I know the author tried to find a picture that emphasize wealth/elitism but they‚Äôre toasting with water lmao
[NAME] crossed his arms and you are ready ... just do it the way that he sighed and slumped down in his comically oversized high back chair.
That would be a hoot wouldn't it? Thank you!!
at this point if you couldnt figure out that most [NAME] here dont actually support [NAME], you must have some problems
This again?
You speak the truth, plain & simple. Yet we‚Äôre the malevolent bad guys! WTH?!
Because a lot of people on this thread are ignoring the pirate code and I‚Äôm trying to explain that rules are there for a reason.
It sounds like he doesn't know exactly what he wants and he's taking it out on you.
oops, my bad.
Well said.
Just pick someone you like and hope for the best!
This thought brings me too much joy. The tantrum-throwing traitor has taken me to a very dark place.
730,000 readers and only 6 posts in a week? Wow...
I don't know what that is so I dont care... you wont hear me clapping
Reclining seats typically reduces the legroom of the person who reclines. That's the way those seats are designed.
New Year, new you. I'm proud of you. 
1 bit u/tippr
I'm ok with this. Man, that'd be some defensive OF.
Tory nationalists puts nationalstic soundbite. TBH, at this stage, an endorsement from TM should be seen as implicit admission that independence is a great idea.
Is that [NAME] as the commentator? EDIT: just finished the video, feel stupid now
I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.
Why exactly would I be talking to other men about sex in any circumstance? I'm not in prison
B + A? Is that [NAME] and [NAME]?
you give him way too much credit with this one
She said she was ok moving out ... now she isn‚Äôt. I have no idea.
"would I be correct to refer to this as ""pop feminism?"" I think we're talking about the same thing when I say that."
Why so quiet now? You had a lot to say to me a handful of days ago.
At least [NAME] got to touch UFC gold. Not many people can say the same. In good company.
Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
Wow that‚Äôs actually a great idea lmao
It‚Äôs mostly because PAX is this week and a lot of players and GMs were off doing that . The game store was super supportive.
Not just that, but all the adipose tissue is very flammable. Too much can actually cause the whole thing to catch fire in a bad way. 
I took in a friend of mine and creating a vanity for her (she loves to do her makeup) is honestly one of my more cherished memories.
That‚Äôs a fine r/beetlejuicing here
Hey, 3/4 of BB20 was amazing. 
Greasy bastards are getting part of what they deserve. Some fines just don‚Äôt seem to be enough sometimes
"You put ""fascists"" in quotes as if the protesters are insane to believe self-proclaimed neo-Nazis and ""alt-right"" nationalists would have anything to do with fascism. "
I have, Just i cant talk with them now, ill try to as fast as possible, thank you for your advice! 
The weird thing is you‚Äôre not even the first haha
Cheers! Let's keep it going!
Its worth the risk
Life beat you to it by years
He also owes [NAME]. a little payback.
True :/
They should prank their customers by having someone act out being given a colombian neck tie while getting a shave.
No response after a week? That's something to worry about.
You mean, their gender. And no, we really just do as much as cis person.
[NAME] damn it I love this but it had a STRONG socialist undertone and I just can‚Äôt fw that
Thank you deeply for these words!
And good riddance!
Thought this was about signing brown. Op is an attention whore
Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
Hostile ? I disagree.
American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
out of curiosity, What are you watching?
> but I have to admit its catchy. This is not and has not ever been an inherently positive characteristic about any song.
Damn that must feel great!
"""You're a good man [NAME]."" Yo [NAME], are you watching the same show I am?"
Dang I hope OP took these cause I wish I could‚Äôve
Nier 1 is 20-30 hours per playthrough. Nier Automata is about 10 hours per route.
I have a launch xb1 and i have maybe crashed twice since the game came out. I have almost 8 days played btw...
So we got Summer‚Äôs model now. Team STRQ flashbacks next volume?
A lot of LGBT people I know just love D&D. Especially since character creation is just everything they want about self-expression and then some.
[NAME] I can understand, but Ukrainian? Is he a migrant from central asia? Or a [NAME]? I am confused
I dunno. Backhanded compliments in girl world are like professional sports.
Because all they care about is themselves, and maybe their immediate family. Its the libertarian ethos - gimme gimme and fuck everybody else.
[NAME] forgot leg day
Mark it nsfw just to mess with people. Worst title I have seen all week.
Absolutely same.
Well potentialy he lived in the same area and recognized him as the same guy he always sees in uniform.
Sorry don‚Äôt follow you.
Definitely on how they act. Although if you put deeper thought into it, calling a woman a girl is rooted in misogyny. But context matters.
[NAME] and [NAME]. There really is NO point of them staying and they are unbearable to watch.
But [NAME], this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream. 
Thats amazing...i just bought a tank. Thanks for the post!
What are you talking about?
Not when you compare it to CW though.
I would enjoy Kreate a Kharacter. But it'll need a lot of help. They shouldn't let you put cubes and stuff everywhere like in SC6.
Where did I state I wanted to keep Syria going? Is making things up just a usual part of your arguements?
starting 2019 of with a banger, can't wait what else will happen this year 
I know right! Now I‚Äôll never even know how far the distance was
"I figured this story would end with her screaming, ""I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE... THIS IS A CAR.. TAKE ME HOME!!!"""
Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
I get that you‚Äôre upset because I find a joke funny, but keeping it to yourself doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone. 
I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her.
Or they will die!
I have that, but my room is right next to my fridge, so that's it.
‚ò†Ô∏è I felt his pain!!!‚ò†Ô∏è R.I.P. furry giblets!!!!‚òπÔ∏è
Healthy attitude here
There you go. You contradict your original position with the [NAME] scenario. That‚Äôs a good start.
Yeah it kinda sucks, that much is for sure, I'm just wondering if anyone knows why or has the same problem
30 for position players is a big deal. 30 for pitchers is the middle of their prime
She‚Äôs clearly hanging at least part way into the space. She‚Äôs so dumb
Wiggins and towns pick and roll use it more
Funny you say that... krav maga is quite popular in Evanston.
M'goodboy. His mommy better give him plenty of tendies and honey mussy for his good manners.
What if they‚Äôre just fans of Dukes of Hazard though... Edit: I forgot to /s. Lol.
Lol that sucks. It's 80.9 in Vegreville, 84.4 at a Costco, or pretty much between 85-89 cents everywhere in Edmonton and area.
Truly a beautiful story, 11/10 :')
I DON'T KNOW. The loneliness goes from mental pain to physical discomfort and pain.
> you've absolutely just generically described absolutely everywhere and not just Scotland. Nope, just the difference between scotland and sussex is staggering. 
[NAME] has been injured for a while... No point in doing that comparison. Not sure if a troll or just new to football
Yea, I'm willing to bet the auto makers have known about this technology for quite a while.
When [NAME] and [NAME] left because they were a bit too male, I guess. Get woke; go broke.
You are a sad person
Is it cruel to give your kids medicine when they don‚Äôt know what it is and why, if they need it?
I have too! I had to pick up sewing to do it but that has been fun as well!
That's how mafia works
This makes me wanna play Minecraft again
No need to apologize. It definitely put things in perspective. I‚Äôm just glad your DD ended up ok.
Jeez i need to find some of these places around me..would love a $2 beer. Everywhere i go is like $9 for draft help
Yup. That doesn't contradict what I said- this isn't a derailing conversation that I was starting.
They just did. Check out the sticky post.
Please don't think the way they're trolling represents us [NAME]. I'm sorry this happened.
> LMAO, it's not free shit head, where the fuck is the source codes? This the real question.
I feel extremely bad for people in this thread who are in any way shape or form relying on the federal government to improve their situation.
Presenting as a guy because you're not fully out yet, and still being read as a woman by a stranger. 
People like standing in line drunk for extended periods of time, apparently. I don't know how else you could enjoy that experience except lots of booze. 
I had to buy all your music after seeing that vid. Amazing work.
I've isolated myself to the extent that i only focus my energy on myself/work.as lonely as it sounds its been such a breath of fresh air.
I think it was more hope, we all make mistakes. I thought [NAME] was going to step up.
I like [NAME], not so much
People who don‚Äôt want to own houses
Intersectionality might seem strange at first, but it really is a good framework for understanding people‚Äôs individual struggles within the context of society‚Äôs biases.
[NAME] is there for under 24 hours and already meets two [NAME]. Nothing to see here, folks.
I love imagining that the drugs just stay ping ponging through the air as more and more drones keep coming to join the battle.
She's a freedom hating commie is what she is. Of course the media loves her; she wants to dismantle everything that made America good.
Who‚Äôs vid is This?
Happy birthday u/automoderator
One more pos to add to the heap.
Using high capital (money/picks) for 3 edge rushers would both be incredibly stupid *and* unjustifiable
Yes it does
You beat me to it!
Yo where they at, I want to celebrate with them.
It‚Äôs definitely a massive problem for both of us. Attributing blame does nothing to solve the problem.
Many people from 2004 played Fortnite too. You know, because it's a good game and not everyone likes to hate on things arbitrarily.
ok thanks alot :), just extremely weird VAC bans are less harsh than throwing for Skins. lol
Sorry but $200 wouldn‚Äôt help. Good bye beautiful world!! I‚Äôm gonna pray to the ether god to help me :)
I disagree with many picks in this list
I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
This would be epic.
Good job...
Low ^hanging ^^fruit
A bag of pita chips is really $8?
9Gag was my jam back in high school! Pleasure to meet an alumni
I know how it feels being in the hospital alone, I hope you get well soon
I feel like people kind of just... forgot about it, somehow? I watched the whole thing and it was a really really fun one
Injury history alone makes him super unattractive.
Good luck.
Not related to any of this but I love your tag next to your username xD
I wonder if losing their majority in the 2019 locals would shift the Unionist parties‚Äô position?
I‚Äôm interested!
I‚Äôm sure she would love it, maybe she‚Äôs scared too!
**I LOVE YOU!!!!** *[NAME] has unfollowed you.* ...oh.
From his username I can tell he lives in a city close to me. I'm sorry everyone, Vermont has better to offer than the likes of him
Jokes about [NAME] hopefully being in MK11
Lmao!!!! Oh this is too good.
Ok so how do I put money on this? Because I do not see Mac shelling out the goods to make that happen
I love [NAME] and how openly she is in supporting him to run
i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( 
Will add to Plano's directory when I make it. Thanks!
As a teacher it would be lovely to eat lunch in this room instead of where i do. GTAGE
So I'll just hide behind my newspaper then.
I'm talking about statement in 11 july, not 14 july. I think you are confused. I posted 11 july statement
That‚Äôs my favorite aquarium! Wish I saw that though lol
He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He‚Äôs an awful person
Hi I'm a Thrashers fan! My family was 33rd to pick tickets in Atlanta in for the '99 inaugural season
Go check out the survey recently posted on AskFeminists. There are a lot of [NAME] openly admitting it.
I'm not trying to intimidate you, just saying that what you are doing is wrong and illegal, and you should stop doing it.
what a ground licker. Day 9799 of being alive - I still hate people.
I went to high school with [NAME], never would have thought he‚Äôd be an isles fan lol
Who even are you? Get off the Internet little boy. I don't have time for you
That‚Äôs it right there. Thanks for the simple reminder.
Danggit. Im mad i didn't think of that
Taking deep, measured breaths usually helps me regain my composure 
Fact: 2:28 I'll never ger back.
Hi [NAME] nice to see you
Love me some Black and Tans, also love Snake Bites as well. 
I think I will try to push through, I guess I can always drop a class or two if it‚Äôs too much and even take a break 
And maybe one day you'll be able to afford one, but until then continue being an edgy teenager whining about the war on drugs. 
Crap. Well, it's still horribly high on Vancouver Island... Wonderful.
Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help.
"Depends. Are your ""toys"" dildos and butt plugs? Or needles and strangers? "
So it‚Äôs somehow weird or different to make a child/student pick up their (there) own mess as part of the lesson?
[NAME] bless that batch tagger extension
Nice, but everyone deserves the best.
That's a shame.. speaking of that though. Where are some good places to hear blues in the city?
JFC, they can't help themselves.
I do but no one wants to play with me I at least try to play by my self but it gets really boring.
Best of luck. Don't be afraid to come back if you want specific talking points if you get stuck. And take care!
Age of consent does not apply to sending nude pictures. If you are under 18, that is still possession or distribution of child pornography.
I loved 'You'! [NAME] is just an added bonus. üòÅ
The sex must be great.
There were more but they got deleted for being duplicates. I removed a couple and the original posters removed a couple too.
Well it very well could be your drug usage. You could be depressed also. So stop doing drugs and see a therapist.
[NAME] is like 16
very long very messy i usually have it in a bun to keep it under control lol
I think my mom is similar but I feel like I make things worse by trying to explain myself.
Let's say for a moment that this was true. How does that get us the truth more often, and more reliably, than science?
It seems to be either forgotten or overlooked that the Jags offense also lost [NAME] and [NAME] last offseason.
Silver is actually not bad in terms of people playing good comps... its when you get to low gold and high gold that keep me liking silver lmao.
I read this is the voice of [NAME]. Great job with the narration!
Oh she dead
Upvoted twice because this is EXACTLY what they think it is and it sucks rat balls.
Thank you for your open mind. Stay strong, fight the good fight, and stay educated.
**Ask Permission** from me and I will tell them yes or no.
Handsome with dark touch!
I'm sure you do lmfao...
yeah i want to see what kind of car it is post pics :)
i actually didnt know that there are people out there using quotation marks for emphasis until that weird [NAME] song
Yeah that‚Äôs what confuses me, like most people (men) who are here are just incels in denial
Do you make a point of letting everyone know you don‚Äôt believe in [NAME] every time you see a religious reference? Or just this one?
I think its absolutely wonderful : )
The city would have that removed so quickly to keep the cash cow mooing.
I am sorry but you have to accept your reality. Thare ain‚Äôt nobody here who can help you on this problem. Just call Î≥ëÎ¨¥Ï≤≠ ASAP
Sick BURN!
Nope. Not how things are done around here.
>slaps windshield This bad boy can fit so many Leds on it
Nah some people naturally have rapid ass metabolisms like that. I sit around all day, but I‚Äôm skinny as a rail.
My dad said, [NAME] was a pin Up girl from WWII. Not sure if that is true. 
I'M AN ADULT!!!
Believe it or not, I actually am. With the exception of stupidity. 
I‚Äôve been there and it‚Äôs above a highway, feel like that might raise some eyebrows haha
DAE hate unnecessarily salty people like OP?
>I want to ride my bicycle I want to ride my bike Ah yes, truly makes you think 
You sound like you're going to be a great PA! Good luck in your new career.
Honestly, it would be even better if she handed the reigns to a brick. Then no deal definitely happens and everyone's happy ever after :D
This is my favourite game of all time and I miss it dearly. I made most of my best friends playing this game.
YOU HAVE JUST DECAPITATED [NAME]!
"> ""NOPE!"" Had a good laugh out of that"
[NAME] I'd love it just to see grumpy writers complain.
I can relate. It kind of breaks your heart and your spirit, doesn‚Äôt it? 
You've been a sad boi around here for the last week straight, you'd do well to take a break.
Came here to say this...... Oh dear OP
Oh I thought it was something that was actually contemplated. My bad
Here i am playing Daggerfall
Only through surgery, steriods, and a high income. Personality is not a factor for woman, looks and status are
Is this the place that had the creme filled donut holes, if not does anyone know where to get them
I can't stand when a team member has no shoes, the sound drowns out other sounds for me and its just incredibly annoying to listen to all game
I think so. It‚Äôs one of my favorite [NAME] characters and a fun trilogy. At that price point I think it‚Äôs really worth it
RemindMe! 1 Day
Get that hole ready for some bricks.
Thanks for this video. It was just what I needed
Getting your helping the elderly badge isn‚Äôt too hard when you are the elderly.
Oh [NAME], oh no, no no no
Thank you, I appreciate it. It was, and still is hard to deal with. 
I think it's weird that he didn't just wake you up and weirder that he didn't tell you until you noticed it was missing.
Super, thanks
This little piggy went to the hospital...
LOL where did you hear that?!
Ahhhh, the ol' cotton candy hat trick.
You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake.
"Because he's an anti-science fool, like other irrational ""environmentalists""."
[NAME] seems like such a quality guy
Here is another extremely informative video about the Wii Shop Channel.
Yep, I've heard this alot, and when you ask for them to rationalize it, they can't. 
Wtf is that
"Oh, I always thought it was gum that had been ""pre-gooed."""
I wish my nickname was [NAME]
I trust my girlfriend enough where I know she won't do anything of the sort
We‚Äôre honestly not doing that bad besides [NAME]. Clear pen, unlucky. Let‚Äôs hope for the best in the second half
Just take antidepressants that take away the urge completely
"If I hear ""not sorry, [NAME]"" one more time, I'm going to start disliking [NAME]"
Like the op said, [NAME] is more of a giver, so I think [NAME] would be happy as long as [NAME] would be happy
That'd be a funnier picture if it was just a picture of the floor with nothing on it
The biggest cringe is actually all the people commenting she's a man
Boulton & Watt in East Village have wifi & outlets.
Thank you, I appreciate it <3
me. i‚Äôm the problem. i don‚Äôt think anyone can help me anymore.
Ugh foot rubs. I feel embarrassed thinking about how my nmom used to make me do this to her. Ugh ugh ugh
Thank you!!
What was the fastest you were ever going over the speed limit when you got it dismissed? I‚Äôm most likely going to go with Sullo also
Appreciate the honesty though
Thank you I very much appreciate it.
Horray for Persona
Thank you for saying this! (Extended breastfeeding mom of a 2.5 yr old here.)
Damn. I don't think candidate has lost Colorado by a double digit margin since [NAME] reelection.
Give some evidence!
I‚Äôve always wanted to do 4 teams of 25 or even 2 of 50
No justice with a cop's bullet in your head
Woah. I've been wondering when this kind of a situation would play out. I keep wondering if I'll recognize someone I know on these posts.
Look like when i wake up in the same bed with my uncle
What is this from?
Pharmacy residencies started that in 2017 and honestly it makes the process so much better for both candidates and applicants.
> **most government positions**, especially elected positions **don't have any education or skill requirements** FWIW Yea they do.
Nashville as a whole is easily one of the most classist, racist, judgemental, prejudiced cities I've set foot in. 
Hey, thanks! :)
Binge drinking is a big problem in VN right now, unfortunately. So I wouldn't be surprised if drunkenness was the main cause of this. 
Never remove an object larger then a nail if it gets stuck inside you, that‚Äôs a job for a doctor
If there's evidence besides say-so, chances are better.
Person #1: ‚Äúwell that was fun.‚Äù *turns around* ‚ÄúGuys...?‚Äù
>They played three games in a week three separate times. [NAME], that's absolutely brutal
Sorry to hear it man. Grief is the appropriate thing to feel. I hope she is happy in the afterlife. Peace be with you both.
> Crab Rave Ayyy I've never seen this before I kinda wanna go but seems scary.
And you forgot Buting and Strang for their world tour squeezing every penny possible from [NAME] death.
Feeling is exhausting. They used to feel those things and now they feel nothing because they're so burnt out and tired
Well, I‚Äôll be here when you fail!
I love [NAME] but he seems to enjoy deleting his videos after a while :(
I know, that's why it's a little unfortunate they don't have a test. 
Please stop using that term.
Great podcast called Uncover on this. Highly recommend!!
"It just has to be ""unequivocal and unconditional"". ""Good faith"" was from the Advocate General opinion, not the Court."
Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
Ah I was confused which side you were on :P
I have to imagine the camera lens part is utter BS.
My youngest whispered to me one night that I was as cool as [NAME]
She‚Äôs such a moron
Glad to see that [NAME] no more is a fellow r/Atheist user and anti-Peterson
Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before
I've seen so many of these and I still have a massive amount of difficulty believing it is possible.
I really pity those unfree Cuban babies. It‚Äôs just sad.
Wait. Do you think socialism is high tax rates?
I hate betting unders.
Why should I waste my time with that?
That's DLo baby
the truth is sexist, deal with it
It seems strange to me that [NAME] is still unsigned this close to the season.
oops, back in a minute, your round!
If/then. Not if/than. ‚ÄúIf this happens, then that happens.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have more than you.‚Äù It‚Äôs never if/than.
I am now sad the latest Thief was so mediocre, because the actual City the game took place in was a great little world.
Damn sorry to hear bro. You guys still friends though?
He looked so shlubby on that show, it was like he was the [NAME] version of [NAME].
More like the choir isn't here, it's on Instagram
I mean if he‚Äôs into it, sure, whatever. I‚Äôm not one to judge. 
I'm not even going to read all of that. It is not mindboggling AT ALL. [NAME] is a huge douchebag. The end.
"The fact that ""TrueChristian"" and ""TrueChristianity"" are so [RELIGION] is extremely telling. The faith is dishearteningly fractured..."
I scored 9 points... I totally love it that everybody is sweating ;D
Again, thanks!
Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!
Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
Welcome to our world.
What does all that pill shit they talk about mean anyways? Like what the fuck is a black pill and a red pill?
Well, yeah, it's a climate target. Climate targets are made for missing.
We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
I‚Äôm glad you had a great time here! Wishing you safe travels!
someone needs to up their weed game damn
Have fun insulting me then. I have fun building and using BSV Insults are too low for me to participate. Sorry
Garlic butter baked chicken.....put garlic butter on chicken and bake.
Not everyone left of you is a lib. You're arrogant.
It‚Äôs not three days. ITS A WHOLE WEEK!!!!! /s
Point is, you‚Äôll have to come clean. Sooner rather than later. And if she loves you, she can forgive you. 
Even though [NAME] has had so many drawbacks and made some mistakes, let's make one thing clear: it's NOT a time to trade him.
This is true...
I can't unsee it now. I wish I could, I love magic
HEY! Once I was out on my own, I **loved** getting socks and underwear as gifts. My son just realized the same thing.
I'm sorry for your loss. Truly. I hope you and your family are doing okay.
I'm not just. I wanna know why its a thing all of a sudden.
Thanks man I‚Äôll try, you stay strong too!
Another thing I always wondered: why doesn't Raddus have autopilot? Would have prevented Holdo's death.
A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
Stop what?
Good for you, human. I hope you get the job!
Geezus... it‚Äôs like I was reading a biography someone wrote about me before getting divorced.
10 mg Trintellix and 1.5 mg Vraylar
They're currently the opposition party, sadly. 
Would destroying the business bring them both closer together?
Thank you. I‚Äôve got till next week to find out then :)
All it takes is for you to brag to the wrong person and then poof
Opposites attract! I thought the same thing when he helped her cook Thanksgiving.
> It‚Äôs generally viewed upon as being one of the worst [NAME] games ever made. No it isn't. Source that claim.
holy crap that's messed up.
But why....specifically?
Pets are the best ‚ù§
So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.
Is this Dragon Age style?
It‚Äôs probably down to low player base.
My wife is a rams fan. I don‚Äôt like them, but I think I like them more than the patriots lol
>Ultimate 12 Inch *notices bulge* *OwO what's this?*
The latter is a good description of the last 16yrs of my marriage (now over, thank the gods). 
[NAME] in drag.
I loved how proud [NAME] looked
And AI will somehow be magically more disruptive than the industrial revolution. Because... reasons.
lol, it is. At least the leftist communities flat out tell you that you'll be banned for it.
Ah, the classic bi for anthros, ace for humans.
The funny/awful part is how well [NAME] works photoshopped in.
I'm sorry, but that poor kitty looks miserable.
Thank you. I found out I can return it since they made it heavier than I ordered.
This has worked for me so many times, whenever I try to make a new habit I try to maintain it for 2 weeks and then it becomes routine
Then income is the right criteria for equality initiatives. That's the logical conclusion we should arrive at from my and your statement
This was last year. Didn't go, definitely should have. I'm fine though 
Thank You, that does seem to be the consensus. 
Mississippi, where your sibling is your first lover.
I already have used one, really helped 
I don‚Äôt care about this mission Texas stuff
I have a lot of unopened DM‚Äôs but thanks
Randall's always needs people.
The sub is VERY socialist so they love this kind of stuff
I mean, he is a terrible president. 
Wow, that was fast
I wish that I could do this and have someone genuinely care, and have it not be a therapist cause I can't afford it. 
We have had luck with a ok to wake clock for quiet time! May be worth a shot.
Have you tried taunting for 90 seconds straight?
Gamers know all too well how it feels to be oppressed by society.
I sent this to my two friends and one said ‚Äúhaha.‚Äù And the other left me on seen : )
Hhhhhh I really want those
Those were not as efficient as in BF3, simply not fun as it was nearly impossible to kill a tank from a single strafe run like in the 3 
I personally think think life is beautiful but living is hell, kinda like a hurricane can be the most beautiful thing.
Should tell the people at 4chan. They will help you forget this
Lol I still reference this clip with my gf ha this dude is a legend
Make this a weekly PSA, please!! Lmao 
That was brutal.
"All that condescension to spell ""capitulate"" wrong. Shame."
No time like the present to start trying.
I CANT BELIEVE HER WIG STAYED ON WITH ALL THAT CAKE!!!! [NAME] tape really does hold back all, y'all. Alaska who?
Wouldn't mind if they brought up his creepy gang rape essays or theory on how a lack of orgasms cause cancer either.
Skypeia in One Piece has literally nothing to do with the main plot but I loved it. It also gave us the single greatest reaction image.
January 19. At least we won't have to wait long for this one.
For now maybe We can however solve the energy crisis with money, the migrant crisis not so much.
The uncanny valley of creepy.
Oh man, when HQGs gets on a roll it‚Äôs so good.
Peace to you both.
Don‚Äôt tweets have to be formatted a certain way? Only thing I can think of
I‚Äôm sorry you were down voted. I am asking for real honesty, so thank you for telling yours.
It‚Äôs incalculable
Good thing the lions no longer run a true 4-3
You will watch porn again, don't try to fool me
*[when your pet is still barking at you]* I'm done trying to convince you.
what a strange, sad, moronic 3 day old account...
Pls provide a timestamp to their antimigration chants and bravado lol
Oh that's so sad
78% of child decisions goes to the mom.
Just get a straw or stick and gently guide him off the car.
We should have just taken him regardless and told them to deal with it but we also might not have [NAME] if we do
Why u watching the NFL? Your [NAME] emperor told you that‚Äôs a no-no. You dare disobey your master and lord?!?
well you done did it lol
Shit musta been bad for him.
Because the universe is dumb and not fair, but we can make it less dumb
Catching some old highlights, the Bernabeu used to so loud, it was a scene, now its so quiet
Reminder!1 month Just so I can repost and harvest karma like everyone else
but you won't hear that from most of the press or people on this sub WHAT IS THEIR POLICY THOUGH lmao
Actually it can be useful when 2 people or so use the carbine for crowd control .
Before all of the BS lol
At least she showed a reaction...
I dunno how to read this yet. I guess it depends on how the other moves they make shake out.
I THINK ITS TIME TIME TIME YEAAAAA ITS TIME TO BUY A FUTON !!!!!!
Can you stop shilling for Russia every damn time they are mentioned?
Alot more common in NY City.

Makes me glad I'm almost 50, and all this is stuff I will never ever experience, and frankly can hardly fathom.
She is only good if a team has good communication. (And this is a ~600hr sombra main saying this.)
thanks for the correction.
I'm still surprised this thing is only 2 Lanes in each direction
Say again?
Please don't use it as toothpaste. It will destroy your teeth.
beautiful story arc. glad you decided to end it in my semi hometown of excelsior - really neat lil town.
What made you so interested in great whites?
You seem way too defensive, dude.
You SW folks and your fancy pubs.
Nope. This guy is legitimately this dumb.
Oh. My heart!
damn you're prolly right. only character i actually hate is [NAME], i'll use a different word
Don't worry, it's the internet so that angle has already been well covered: 
[NAME] dropped his career high on them last season.
you obviously dont know how the wilpons work lol
As long as [NAME] isn't suggesting [NAME] to the Lakers I'm ok with pretty much any Ringer rumor
I REALLY should get my breaks checked.
But if [NAME] wins... well, things might change.
Took me long time to figure out there are two dogs.
I suspect wilful idiocy to sell books and merchandise to the even more idiotic.
No I meant like did they then forget and ask a follow up question. Basically making the situation more funny.
DAMN I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT
oh, me too, actually.
[NAME] wife has wanted him done with wrestling for, oh, the last 25 years or so.
seriously wtf. I want to see how the whole hand went in detail. that was the sickest soulread ever
Aaaaaand soccer! Hopefully...
I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need
I understand just so hard feels like I‚Äôm being thrown away like trash I don‚Äôt want to imagine a life without her in it
thanks for the warning :)
Thanks guys for the explanation, didn't know that!!
That‚Äôs awesome!
I always thought the U was for urine .. well this is going to be awkward.
It‚Äôs so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! 
I would lol
Drunk and crying in bed with my pets. :|
He just have to beat em. I only have him @ 5 because he just got there & I don't really count the horn/Benavidez fight.
100% feel for you. I may be exaggerating slightly but still it‚Äôs all these little disadvantages that we get put at because of this ping.
I‚Äôm crying omfg
That‚Äôs nothing compared to some days from the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs.
‚ÄúWhat about people who mow down pedestrians in the streets‚Äù Key word THEIR OWN BODIES. An unborn child is a child a separate being.
It's good worrying about things that can be helped. Lol
As far as anal- go slow and there is never too much lube!
The functional use could be served by a $5 watch, so that's not really the point.
That might be intentional? Not sure, I don't use it.
Well then name players who were better than Astralis players this year who are not in the top 10.
I really hate this family. Nothing but snake-oil salesmen who's negative influence will reverberate for a new generation of young women who deserve better role models.
My favorite new fan! Glad to see you here! Rest up and get ready for the Friday game.
I wish this was me.. To have lots of friends.. *Sad dragon noises*
I think it doesn't have to be only in school, but anyway, good attitude, I'm sure you can overcome it (with patience)
I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
i was in that thread, but i can at least admit it ;)
I dont think he was projected to go that high...if im not mistaken people had him at a late first round pick
Is that a normal price for this kind of thing or is it [NAME] expecting a super-wealthy person to impulse buy?
My dad had the same problem in the same fingers thanks Op .I'll share this with my dad.
I don't think you should expect solid logic out of someone who believes [NAME] exists.
You are extremely rude and condescending, and in my opinion it‚Äôs sad that you‚Äôre a teacher. 
I would really Like to know about the ride back
Oh cool so you admit to being a pedo.
You didn‚Äôt change my mind, but that‚Äôs actually a very interesting thought ‚Äúthe Skywalkers are the imbalance‚Äù.
Because III is already remastered... so why not?
Ooooooh I wanna try it now!
I don‚Äôt know who [NAME] is and, at this point, I‚Äôm too afraid to ask.
> your character is so yuck Thank you, for confirming my suspicions of who/what you are.
I wonder the same thing. Where could I go where no one would ever find me. I usually come around to dropping myself in the millworks.
Damn she might have actually had a stroke if she started panicking
I feel like this is from Shitpostbot 5000
Yea I've heard this also so that's why I'm curious how well this one will last.
Nah, black bears are big scaredy cats Now brown ones on the other hand...
I‚Äôm ok with this. If you were sb and bad LAG was BB, I‚Äôd also be ok with a stop-and-go. 
He‚Äôs soft. No heart.
Its ok we all know you suck scrub.
Talked with my parents. It was so relaxing and beautiful <‚àö9 Thank you a lot ‚ù§
Hi, this is ISIS. Yes, we did that.
Matinee games should not be allowed for us anymore, we‚Äôre terrible at matinee games
Uh, loved and lost, for sure. I‚Äôd like at least one pleasant memory to look back on.
I love when it drops, and the beat just stops. Feels like the musical equivalent to a cliffhanger 
Am I the only one who is glad I saw this meme? I mean I'm officially traumatized, but still.
Just a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy
Wow, I don't know how [NAME] handled that
*US MILITARY WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
I‚Äôm really late here, but I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen anyone bring up the possibility of them wanting to eat you.
Number 20 to the rafters.
so who do you think were gonna face in the playoffs???
Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
Yes, you're supposed to keep it. Like I said, its only when the voice gets out of control that you should start to worry.
Ayyy exactly!
#BUTTLICKER!
If you‚Äôre concerned about [NAME], then you must still be concerned about [NAME]. WAR over last 2 seasons: [NAME]: 4.8, 3.1 [NAME]: 4.0, 3.6
When I think about [NAME] and [NAME] at the same time I get a fucking aneurysm from the stupidity.
If you had a giant rock on your land, and you couldn't stop people climbing, wouldn't you be pissed?
I'm not sure these guys are wingers, but other than that, I'm very happy so far
If it remains free at point of use and the level of service doesn't decrease then what's the problem?
Ohh it gets even more interesting:
I saw this to, thanks tho :) it helps but not as much as I'd like
Everything on this sub is touchy usually no? Hah no worries, just offering my other perspective
Great work guys! Always A++ Prime casters!
It's great having both [NAME] and [NAME]
No kids, I have a broken oven. When my marriage fell apart that was a blessing.
6 months is not long term in my opinion. 2 years and up.
i love the crocheted romper look and i don't care if i'm wrong
doubt it, there wasn't a single mention of it
I need to hear more stories like this. I've only heard horror stories of the pain with the surgery as an adult.
That‚Äôs my luck. Lol
I'm going to put my life first and run away.
They could just lie! And then only musicians who look at it and can do reasonable sightreading would know they're lying.
Good for them
He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
I love cowboy.
Thank you...next
Fight me coward! I will never ne frego!
Thank you.
I like these kinds of multicultural projects. Very much in line with my feels about South Africa.
Danger noodle!!! Danger noodle!!!
They might say that capitalism has directly or indirectly caused just as many deaths (slavery, colonialism, etc). 
Alberta needs to get with the times.
Look, I knew the end of that last sentence in my mind. It's not my fault you can't keep up.
‚ÄúThrive has changed not just your life but mine as well.‚Äù üôÑ yeah, definitely a child‚Äôs sentence structure
Till Valhalla brother, you will be missed. 
My bf just got this too. He's obsessed
Right but many people don‚Äôt as well. You can‚Äôt just assume that someone is gonna perform better...
Or the Samsquatch
[NAME] on Road Trippin' with how much fun she has with ET and gets super straight forward with anybody else.
Seeing Capital Cities live so learning to sing Chartreuse out of excitement.
he's gotta make shots and get to the line...2-6 so far, no ft's
it's not gatekeeping if it's true
So you defend an evil murdering dictator and pedal conspiracy theories and whataboutism. Grow up.
That sounds simple and good
Dude that looks like some sh*t out of a James Bond movie!
What really? I cant believe no one has ever said that before! You may have saved my life.
Not to mention the small electronic machines that we all carry around in our pockets. It'll be interesting to see how this impacts online casinos that accept cryptocurrency.
No prob, comes with the territiry.
Yes YES #YES
Update; i can't sleep too many thoughts of her and pressure from asking her out tomorrow.. yesturday i was high so i could fall a sleep easly.
If they could just let us customize the lines it‚Äôd be fine
It literally just happened. I'll talk to them when I get a chance but my heart dropped for sure.
yeah sounds like you're thinking real hard on it. Stop wasting peoples time theres folks in actual need for help. And this sub isnt for that
air supply? the irony of life
I bet there is an army of married couples who did the same exact thing.
[NAME] is so immature.
Same thing happened to me last year ended horribly
Based on the damage
Does anyone have the quote in context (video or audio)? Based on the amount of Bigoteering going on the mainstream left-leaning press I'm sceptical.
[NAME]: [NAME] didn't say that! (I hate that I agree with her on something)
Misread. I‚Äôm with you my dude.
yes!! i was like oh my god. oh my [NAME]. it‚Äôs gone. the weight‚Äôs GONE. i‚Äôm FREE!
What happened with the guy at work?
[RELIGION] is what produces these people, there are plenty of them and a beheading has even occured in the streets of LONDON.
You stole an Instagram meme? For shame
Thanks for your input, I should have clarified the pop part of pop psych.
Bidets are disgusting. In america, we use toilet paper because our plumbing systems can take it
As quick as possible? I wish. 2 hours and 9 minutes I will never get back
Streamgate works fine for me and i'm not even late :3.
Thats the second quickest way I know of to burn through $1,000...The first being: R/WallStreetBets ü§£
I agree. I was merely attacking the fragility and ineffectiveness of democracy. Thanks for the example!
And this comes as no surprise too anyone
I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.
Wanting to have immigration controls is in no way, shape, or form racist. 
Thanks a [NAME]
Brutal. I'm so sorry.
I‚Äôm just glad to finally see something truly cringy in a while
An extreme strawman example doesn't change what I said.
Prove him wrong.
Or, orrrrr. All Girls Poop Mindset Only video you need to naturally have confidence when you socialize All Girls

Because that sub is for VLs.
You are right.. There something to be said after banging both your mom and gf while they are on the rages.
Orange fan sad. :(
Like the poor redhead in True Blood that got vampired as a virgin, but worse.
I mean, she actually is a genius, so I really dont have a problem with her identifying herself as one
There‚Äôs no room for subtleties. This is a consensual nation.
Lol for the past 2 weeks I wondered if an unpopular opinions thread should go up and I was hesitant for the same reasons. Lol mind reader sis
I just don‚Äôt understand this.
You‚Äôll struggle to get premier league tickets (without paying a hefty premium) so concentrate on the lower leagues.
"""This is good. What is it?"" ""Es carne de burro."" ""Heh, my name's [NAME]."""
Do you regularly go around calling people a know-it-all when they've generously provided you with specific information you've demanded?
Nice, thanks man
Levitate also means you can walk on water
I think of [NAME] hot dogs. I hate that I love them so much.
I dont even try to land it, half the time if I am flying low a building or the ground will suck me up and destroy the plane
Too bad it's only good enough to fool dumb animals or animals with poor eyesight
The best part of adult snow days is no make-up!
I appreciate the fact that you used your precious time to translate the meme in Latin.
Sorry man I don‚Äôt really like duck.
You're a tenant if you lived there for months and that was an unlawful eviction.
[NAME] is lining up for West Ham, holy shit im excited to see this play out
Yo kiddan bro. You from Detroit?? ü§£ü§£
Not all atheists do this, but some do and it's a genuinely strange phenomenon.
I‚Äôm constantly surprised that [NAME] doesn‚Äôt hate her.
"""Highline poles""; I'll keep those in mind. Thanks. "
"""Been there, got the t-shirt, paying it off for the next 15 years."""
Nice to see a rare court case involving a meta-human.
Oh my [NAME].
They just need to clean the bathroom better.
Lol I lol'd *I too am down with the kids. But not like that because that would be illegal*
Likely some more bitching about easily fixable features being swept under the rug by employees
Same here but it seems like that will make it more rewarding to actually build a base with gardens and stuff.
What do you mean
[NAME] damn I love Coops
I crave physical contact. I get irritable if I go too long without it, which conflicts with the fact that I also enjoy being alone.
Thank goodness she came clean! no one would have ever suspected otherwise!
I'm so sorry. Read about you getting kicked out at home. That must be devastating
>just something motor**sport** fans tell themselves to avoid admitting it‚Äôs not really a **sport**. Errr.
Stop all the bullshit. Keep AB. Pick one.
Same, ASMR is nightmarish. My skin crawls just thinking about it.
What would you consider to be oppression of women?
I'd give it a 6.9, based on the fact that he was still caught in the tree
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.
It's impossible for communism to exist without a state.
Ugh I live in WA state and now I'm scared I'm going to get measles even though I'm vaccinated, I hate anti-vaxxers
I figured it would be ‚Äúthe joke is always real in the comments.‚Äù
Great, thanks :) remember, just let it go!
Go hang out with some friends
Intolerance of intolerance isn't intolerant my dude
Gotta love trailing for 59+ minutes
Same. I was not rooting for the Pats. I WAS rooting against the chiefs. The AFC West is ours and ours alone :)
"And of course, instead of calling out the men responsible for this behavior, the ""Not all men"" crowd has arrived in full force."
Sorry for your loss mate
Wow thank you so much for explaining all that to me! It sounds like you guys have a great system going on - very organized.
You're the reason [NAME] won the election. There isn't anything even remotely resembling fascism in the United States. Get a grip.
What if I dont want the service? Why should I be forced to purchase that service?
Yeah I usually do it if no-one will
Maybe it's similar to how [NAME] hates cantaloupe.
"she said (i swear to [NAME]) her doctors told her she wasnt bipolar and has ""anxiety caused by other people"" "
Much appreciated! I'll surely come back and let everyone know what I find!
[NAME] maybe next year,i didn't think she was gonna win but hope she gets in the top 30 by the end
Ahhh yes the, their all Russian controlled bots play, a classic in the last few years
Sorry to hear that, I hope you're doing better now.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs up to you‚Äù Clearly it is not up to you, or you wouldn‚Äôt have had a flipping miscarriage! 
What an interesting thread you referenced in your response!
Similar feeling here. We'll are just bunch of weebs.
Also I know a guy in a metal band called Artificial Sacrifice. They're really small and always looking for gigs. Check them out on Instagram
How did you try it if it's not live yet? There was no early access to it
THIS IS SO GOOD. Thank you!!!
Thanks [NAME].
I mean, me neither! Who would have thought?! We saved a girl's life. Cheers!
Growing up in Chicago this was my life. Pissed he didn‚Äôt make it.
Defense that's why
Oh [NAME]!
Just get him out of my sight I‚Äôm tired of losing and those who contribute to it
Outstanding, really outstanding. I can't wait for her visit to the United States.
Minimum wage hurts small business more than it helps the poor.
Nah it's cool. We love you. Please don't do terrible things.
David Cameron's jealous.
That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. 
And when I went to your moms house she told me about her super awesome witty son.
Dodged some great cheese. I love their cheese.
i saw that before. what does that have to do with this?
Ok that's why, I was so confused of why I saw two [NAME].
Even if you think me and him aren't soulmates, youve gotta be pretty sad to think soulmates don't exist. 
This is as subtle as the 2nd choice is the MP telling you to go and fuck yourself.
Oh fuck off already.
IDK about this stuff but I think you need a psychologist.
Do you know what caused the relapse? Identify the cause of failure so you won't repeat the same mistake.
I learned that in my favourite documentary about Canada, Strange Brew.
That was brutal as hell. Loved it
I dunno man. Guitar picks and baby pacifiers both seem to enter the quantum realm as soon as their dropped.
Found the checher
[NAME] likes a Pacific plan, too.
I was going to ask what temperatures are like where you live. The beauty of losing refrigeration in the winter is having the great outdoors.
it made me cry too when [NAME] return to her older selfüò¢
Allowed to, sure. Just don't expect me to provide you lube. And don't complain to me when you start chafing.
> I don‚Äôt understand the boot-licking mentality Calling it in 5 years. That's your future AP.
18 is hot but very bland, it's just here this blonde lady who is not as hot as blonde launch.
Severally normal people. He stopped supporting these people once the facts came out
If you like Thai food, try Firefly.
He had better get 1st ballot. He's a legend.
I enjoyed that Bagel Boss commercial. Suddenly craving some Greiss Coffee.
You look like 1 of those ISIS fighters got shot in the head
Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.
Driving drunk and killing people is where it stops
Laughed my balls off
You know, you‚Äôre right, she didn‚Äôt take the opportunity as seriously as she should have it seems
I dont think it will happen cuz he will probs just stay in GS or go LA with/ against [NAME] but I do think he should look into it.
Cucumber for some reason always seems darker to me. Maybe it‚Äôs cause less people buy it so they sit there longer
All these threads are being brigaded hard. They're not even trying to hide it.
I didn't mean for that to sound racist I just mean those [NAME] in the article
Glad to hear it :) definitely more on the way!
I remember just feeling sick watching this, [NAME] made me cringe hard, I found [NAME] hilarious and ru looked terrible 
Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!
[NAME], Thank you!
WILL YOU TWO SHUT UP? PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP
If you were the OP this would matter.
Nobody claims that 20th century socialism was a utopia. Please remember your own comment before replying.
Me and friends just got Vermintide 2, and it isn't an MMO but it solves a lot of MMO problems we had. Quite fun so far.
"""[NAME]""? What is this, 2005?"
Why not streamlining that: the fine could be converted to the coverage for the poor students. A good gesture from legislators would help so much.
I didn‚Äôt notice till the replay and honestly, I screamed
I would rather this crappy meme die.
"No....""burnt"" together, just planted in different areas!"
You guys look so amazing, even the pipe is making a jealous look... or maybe i'm just going blind from the cuteness.
That'll teach 'em. I bet they won't do that again!
That illegitimate-no-good-dastardly-basterisk deserved what he got!
Either they don‚Äôt understand the meta context of it, or aren‚Äôt fans of such a meta ending.
I don‚Äôt think you understand the meaning of cute
I don‚Äôt understand why people give gold to crossposts. You deserve all the upvotes.
Wow that‚Äôs like - sound porn.
Ah what a bummer! Better kill them herons & spoonbills!
Wow. You have literally no idea how American politics works. It's almost as if you're either a bot or a troll.
Wait that‚Äôs actually funny why is it on this reddit
I like that idea.
Sitting down and wiping is disgusting. Especislly when using a public toilet. Fucking savages up in this thread.
I see,if you'll just excuse me............ ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ )
Never forgive, never forget 
Good job Mr [NAME]. That is all
St. Anger and All Nightmare Long are my favorite albums :))
I‚Äôm just gonna see how tomorrow goes tbh. I‚Äôll take life one day at a time :) thank you for the help ‚ù§Ô∏è
Just said so casually...lol!
The first article on their is talking about the [NAME] documentary...? E - there*. What the hell is my phone doing
Uuuuh I bet they look sick :D
So happy the new rules weren't in place back then. All those hard hits on [NAME] would have made the refs flag-happy
You're back but you're still broken.
They aren't short either though. There's no hot 5'4 guy in hollywood that most women would swoon for.
It's possible though, that the mere threat of getting caught is enough of a deterrent 
Come on, at least give the man some eyebrows
[NAME] have been doing this a while and it rarely works.
Damn I never had to wait that long. Then again where I live is a town more than a city so much less busy etc
For the people and finding out how they end up? Sure. Other than that, it‚Äôs not great. Frustrating at best. 
üò≠I appreciate the feedback <3
My girlfriend always says ‚ÄúThem‚Äôs the rules.‚Äù And I love it. I also love ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make the rules.‚Äù
some caps fans *really* love jumping to conclusions without any basis whatsoever
or a matter of position you choose!
Except my points are objective facts and his are opinions.
Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.
It has to get better. Hang in there!
[NAME] got in before [NAME], but other than that...
Happy cake day bruh
[NAME] AND PORZINGOD UNDER THE TUTILAGE OF DADDY DIRK PINCH ME I MUST BE DREAMING
Not really. Lots of young adults are living with parents because renting/leasing or even applying for mortgage is way more expensive than it used to be.
Not defending the poor choice, but maybe he thought this is what they'd like?
New Houston foodies here that make Youtube videos on food primarily on Houston spots. Would love some honest feedback!
Finally some appreciation
He's actually 2-3 years older than [NAME]
"Huh. Similar things happen to me. Just my big brother believe that I got the wrong diagnoses and Dad think I am ""cured""."
Yeah it is not stupid to get heated. I would've told her off too and tell her she's nuts straight to her face.
I looked at several different websites - mine are not perfect. But I like them. Mostly referenced this website.
I agree. She's a terrible model. I tried to get on board with her, but all her editorials in Vogue were so flat. 
If you are reading this have a nice day!\xEF\xBB\xBF
one of us ... I do that too
Same! Makes me want to hug them and feed them milk.
That's bomb! I'm so happy for you! Good luck
I'm sad we have you at home this year. I want to make a trip to see Allianz.
Not sure what you're talking about then. Feints work on untrained people, just not subtle feints.
[NAME] is a terrible defender, and as much as I like [NAME], I think it would be more beneficial to move his contract and sign another piece
This is going in the next update.
It means >![NAME] is the only one really close to Dutch now.!<
Making my bold prediction now. [NAME] finishes #1 RB in 1/2 PPR for 2019.
Agree. Don't assume anything, even the worst. First get the facts : while being prepared for any facts.
Peep show is so damn good
Even weirder way to spell [NAME].
Sorry, wrong comment train. Just gonna sneak right by ya there.
Ohhhhh come on [NAME], just two more years...
[NAME]. Forever
did it work?
[NAME] is definitely a good player, would probably be an [NAME] in the East, but fuck him lol
I‚Äôm so glad they remastered that game, I‚Äôm having a blast playing it again
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
"Can you clarify what you mean by ""transcendent moral order?"
Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my [NAME]. It even has a watermark.
Your mom is putting actual effort into having a relationship with you, you insufferable donut. 
Yeah he is a giver not a taker
What a political whore Uncle [NAME] is!
I don't think we've seen his full potential yet. With [NAME] we have, he can be really good. It's just rare nowadays...
>[NAME] would be the most common in Derry and then [NAME]. Tyrone too
It's so odd. He even sits in the co-pilot spot. Why isn't he now the pilot? [NAME] had never even flown into space before.
I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth. 
Oh you mean the time when the world was controlled by individual land owners who created their own states
They do in the common tourist hotspots where our undesirables travel.
I loved when the guy who plays [NAME] showed up as a reporter in The Good Place, but I wish he'd have spoken the same way.
Maybe this one is more correct? Yours don't have Amarillo in the billboard
Is that supposed to be outrageous? Assuming he met the requirements and earned them all, good on the guy for planning for his future.
You went from hot to hot, that‚Äôs crazy!
Yes, I had to drive about 2 miles to the restaurant but I only waited 5 minutes. 
Do you mean ‚Äúlol‚Äù?
[NAME] i feel personally attacked
‚Äú‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt try it, [NAME]. I have the (moral) high ground!‚Äù 
Sold car almost two years ago.... no regrets and quality of life has actually improved.
I wish I could go, but I can‚Äôt. Do enjoy your time and I pray it is spiritually fruitful for you!
Sniffing all them electrical outlets is hard work! This is the PC version... Why didn't you use Print-Screen?
In my experience they suck
I appreciate this. If you hadn't done this I would have felt terrible all day
PLQ is soon. Wanna focus up. That‚Äôs why only Splyce is I guess
Those are his real friends
r/braincels is that way bud
Until you get to mid silver lick dps and carry. Then you can go back to tank and you'll get back up there
Smh bro you cropped the answers, I gotta know!
Live out their Shonan Anime fantasy of being ‚Äúthe one‚Äù without a proper DM to tell them no.
I like how she was trying to stop the fight, then just gave up and started throwing them too.
Just got home from work, do we really have 4 goals on 8 SOG?
[NAME] bless you, fellow [NAME]! What a wonderful testimony of the changes that [NAME] can make in us. 
I cant stand [NAME]
Plus you forgot the best part... I can hang my hands from an outer vest
Thank you for these helpful points. I‚Äôll read them again later.
‚ÄúNot a word you need to learn, honey‚Äù Cringiest part of the whole episode.
Probably vallied out man haha
Just called my mom and told her I love her, thank you reddit mom!
Sounds fun to be around her....Jk:)
We all make acceptable compromises to maintain relationships. If that‚Äôs part of you and it‚Äôs unacceptable to him then he can change his choice.
Was wondering the same thing.
"Quoth the [NAME], ""I didn't do it!"""
Thank you, kind Internet stranger.
Idk why this is downvoted. Sounds like they were asking a legitimate question and was truly curious.
Why it's bad for a union rep to be siding with ownership in the middle of a contract dispute on Twitter of all places?
You should really go see Aquaman though. In IMAX if you can - it's breathtakingly beautiful.
GIVE HIM ALL THE MINUTES
That wasn't very incredibilis of you.
What about Post Morty?
How are you doing man? I mean, what's up in your life right now? You seem really miserable tbh.
oh my gooooood
Um....Yes? I would love it if everyone didn't believe in [NAME].
Ooh I might try that
Like a glove
From what the experts say his chances are like 0 so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
I feel this!
Pretty sure he's by far and away the biggest asshat on this sub lmao
He looks like he smells of cheese
It's not funny. Your neighbor doesn't sound very bright.
[NAME] pays big. He bought out Hot Doug‚Äôs so he could enjoy their foie gras sausages 4x a day.
My bad! It looked so real XD thanks for the heads up
I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
It's definitely alive. Not sure it's doing quite so well...for 99% of people anyway.
I want [NAME] and [NAME] in Top 3 so I‚Äôm feeling the omens girl
[NAME] is a very nervous insecure man because he's got all them RINGZZZ he has to protect.
Like what?
She actually survived the incident, I don‚Äôt know if anyone has the article
Yes she does! She is beautiful but has taken it much too far with the lip fillers and fake tan
Oh man you sure showed me, good job champ
Don‚Äôt be silly. Fiat on/off ramps will always be centralized.
So you're a liar.
Yeah I think this is a well rounded pov. Agree.
This is golden.
Man I hate that [NAME] guy.
Alibaba has some cheap sosial antennas and and thick tape for sharp edges.
He's completely lost any power or rip moves.
How many guys did they have on IR? I think their top 2 lineman at each spot were out at least. Hell, they almost beat us.
How so?
There is no evidence connecting him to the crime.
You're simply suggesting betrayal in a different form.
Intelligence is to know the difference between MB and Mbps. Wisdom is to not be a cunt about it.
Will see,still better for Chelsea then [NAME] who looked completely lost and devoid of any confidence lately
I can‚Äôt tell which shirt was 2 dollars or which was 5 dollars for example
You are just tricking yourself.
That‚Äôs the way I interpreted it too, but i was laying in bed half asleep when I heard it, so I could be way off.
I took a picture of the sunrise this morning too. Just north of Austin. It was very pretty today.
[NAME] looks like one of [NAME] children.
As a college student that played football I'm with you lol. My team smashed mcdonalds all the time and it was great
[NAME] is a nut; he has a rubber butt!
Dude. Same. That would just be... Devastating.
Jazz too i remember the office and pnr talk about how bad it is.
Can we have a video tribute to [NAME] when the Jazz come to Atlanta?
I wish I hada dog who is as good of a boy as him
I've been waiting to watch [NAME] die for a long long time. Sure hope that one is right.
Growing up there were people in our church who hated the Smurfs because they were magic using communists.
"""[NAME]!"" *screeched the two apprentices as they tried to prove their worth to the the one who shall not be named*"
I'm worried he choked to death before he could finish the sentence.
Look at the size of those shorts!

Maybe you could put it in the context, which was responding to someone who claimed to have been blocked for political reasons.

Yeah, might just grab a coffee and be done with it.
Well howdy neighbor. I'm also about 200m away from there. It inspired me to setup wireless security cameras.

I literally only just got this joke, and Mr Plow has long been a top five episode for me. 
Shout out to all the homes putting in work on the at marvel/dbfz
[NAME], too. [NAME] is very guilty of this.

Poeling is looking like a fkn stud. Imagine our C depth next season... [NAME]... holy fuck

Thanks so much for your reply it helps to hear from others. Good luck on your journey.
That‚Äôs a cool steering wheel cover
Gave ya an upvote but sadly, by reading this thread its not going to help
It‚Äôs an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. [NAME] was incredible this week.
Yeah I misread
I recommend this. I read the WN and it fucked up my English for months. English is my second language...
Happy cake day bot!!
Oh [NAME], my new friend. How much time and wine do you have.
Oh my [NAME] do you value 'freedom' over safety?!
She did, but she forgot she had them in her bag.
I think I just view her even more as a friend instead of as a psychiatrist. I can‚Äôt help but worry about her wellbeing listening to me
Looks like a badly designed [NAME] avatar
>The only person who said the CIBC cheques were not cashed is from Quadriga. I believe [NAME] said the same when interviewed for the coindesk article.
Wow! That sounds like an interesting dream! Thank you for your perspective.
What was he ‚Äúhealing‚Äù you from?
No, you just have to either pay the stable fee to revive it or get the insurance.
[NAME] loves his leaf crown
And [NAME] said trust but verify, which is what the House will do.
I‚Äôm sorry, you just sound like one of those people who takes overwatch super seriously and has no life
I understand why... But it's so sad we have to lie... It breaks my heart...
Meh, whenever I travel with someone who can't walk fast, I just wait for the next train.
Oh, wow, I didn't know my Dad had a Reddit account.
O-officer what are you doing with those cuffs? <w<
We need more media coverage on the [NAME] abductions, and since the Alliance won‚Äôt do anything the BBC is our only hope.
Sounds great! Thanks!
Don't do that. Only villains do that.
The important thing to remember is 0 is also a number!

No man. Door wins!
"""Don't make me count to 3! 1...2...TREE!"""
If I may ask what was the deal breaker for you? Did you stay in contact after the breakup? How much time did you need to heal?
My entire body aches now
thanks! yeah a bit, wrote for my college paper last semester but thinking about doing more
I LOVE google voice! IT's the only way I can get my parents to reply to anything!
Me too. At least we acknowledge what we are and don't make up excuses in that regard.
Thanks? Lol. Pairing [NAME] or [NAME] with [NAME], defensively, though? Yikes, to say the least.
Man that dude seems to be having a blast at the character select screen. I'm so hyped, where do I sign up?
this is probably one of the top 5 most legendary copypastas from this community - I‚Äôve always loved this one
And she has ignored every single one of them, as expected of course.

Why is it arrogant to think LIVING IN A FUCKING BEAR CARCASS is wrong?

Very very very naive.
Why did this get 100+ upvotes in 2 days?
It's true though. He either gets no shirt and freezes to death or wears a stupid looking butchers cape. I hope he gets something better next season

You can only have such preposterously high rates if your tax code contains legal ways to evade taxes (e.g. deducting depreciation on loans).

Wow, I love the car ride idea. Thanks for sharing that!
One of [NAME] elections revolved around his supposedly illegitimate child. Congress used to get into physical brawls. This isn‚Äôt some sort of untouched level for America.
Better get a paternity test sorted for my munchkin of a partner and his equally munchkin daughter, he'll be thrilled. 
Literally one visit to that subreddit is proof enough it's mentally addictive. Brain craving dopamine when it's not producing it.
good move. needed another lefty in the pen.
in the words of [NAME]: As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it. Had to give you a career to destroy it 
I love this man.
That's why it's only 20$

Good luck to you! Cheers to a new year! üëçüèº
Condolences. Take comfort in your cats and breathe. Consider a grief counselor.
That's what I say, but the commercial is clearly pandering.
It's hard to make friends. :( I sit alone.
When I read where the fire apparently started that was my first thought.
This image is cropped to avoid showing the private passenger car NY plates. [NAME] has no need to pander to any ethnicity; he's term limited out.
"""No"" is the complete sentence I will use for this exercise."
Amazing. Idk how to keep the house clean. It is impossible to manage laundry.
The keg talent is awesome with a touch of honey and another round turning [NAME] into a mage

It's Cursed Ryoma

This is an incredible insight I've never thought of before. loyalty vs disloyalty, compared to care vs harm, I mean.
Feeling your pain. I was laid off due to our department closing the week after Thanksgiving. Good luck to you. Stay strong.
Yeah, this is always my first thought when I read this kind of stuff, kinda sad to be honest 
Therapy helps. If only to just talk and be able to process what has happened.
I noticed that too! Lol it's bugging me.
Thanks mate!
Yup, the cammer is at fault here.
Common sence isnt that common any more

I hate when people Beijing a gun. Even worse when they Shanghai one.
Because in some cases parents are basically having their own children kidnapped and held against their will and forced into these programs. This is child abuse.

Nice try hilary but you lost to those idiot minority
Thanks for that, I just turned 35 and considering nursing and starting over too
Hhhhhaaarrryyy [NAME]!
No, because men get attacked for wearing skirts simply because they have a penis. It's a social thing, not a legal one.
Unrelated but happy cake day!!
And how often the Asian guy is the token gay guy (especially since Uncle George came out). What I would give for more Asian romantic leads!

oooops... now you tell me???
Wow you‚Äôre mom is truly living by the love first motto that is [RELIGION].
Make a blog. Make an anonymous YouTube channel. Write poetry or songs. Make music. Create! Funnel these thoughts into something positive and constructive.
Fair enough. But remember, the sooner you spawn, the sooner you'll have that sweet free labour around the house 
Bee‚Äôs are cool
That's a huge shame and says more about Sacks than it does anything else.
Dude just get them drunk.
Man, I can‚Äôt wait to buy cannabis from [NAME].

He was going for a new record for fastest to the bottom.
Furthermore, that top part isn't even males only. The bottom part is tho.

Typical spewing of logical fallacies by a dotard. Go back to bestgunnit and play with the other special needs children.
Happy birtday my dude
I chopped it up a little for you. I hope that helps. I'm not sure I can make that much more concise.
i dunno it just seems like a really dumb thing to do?
yes, he has 1 open seat in the back row left..
Surprised he didn‚Äôt get hit with a random drug test
You have devoted yourself to this guy and he thinks you would be a bad mom. Fuuuuuuuck this guy. You deserve better.
I think it is simply that all the stress got to [NAME]. He is human after all, and he apologised for what he did, IIRC.
Nope, works just fine. Was just there.
Awesome. Im pretty jelly rn, im on a t-break for a month. Hope you enjoy. Sending positive vibes brother!!
I think we would be interested in seeing how something like this would work. Would you post the information? Send notifications? I'm curious.

Sorry he was a United director when he bought it.
not surprised it‚Äôs too challenging for you to read
The Fire are also trash and play their games 45 minutes outside of Chicago. Love you Fire fans, sorry about your ownership and FO. 
They seceded because [NAME] was elected despite not appearing on any slave owning states. How is this anything but under representation of ideology.
This is actually awesome.
Still my nightmare aged 34....
Oh it is, it's just that you know that thing...about the intel
With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
I thought I could handle it but I was wrong. Good [NAME] was I wrong.
The same is true for Oblivion and Morrowind. They still bring us joy, thanks to lots of awesome mods.
My bad on the terminology, see my response above for some of my thoughts / concerns related to the presence of 2-chlorophenol

I guess [NAME] has something he wants to tell you
Got it! I wasn't aware that it was a slur, and thought that it was just a general term used. Thanks for the info.

Also, this has been said half a million times but the Oilers were not picking [NAME] with that draft pick even if we didn't trade it away.
Just says that [NAME] is his new main man. Doubt it was an intentional dig at [NAME] but it sure feels like it.
Ironically, I just sense that they are working in an area where this is a ready stream of revenue just waiting for them.

Most national subreddits are nowhere near *real* people, it's quite interesting to see the disparities.
Right. It was wasted screen time. But oh no, we couldn‚Äôt have a Snoke flash back that was 30 seconds *at most*.

Outraged suburban white moms ranting about stupid things that don‚Äôt matter and making ridiculous comparisons are peak humor

Rahway Mechanical LLC should be able to. Great guy
How stupid of [NAME] to rely on LibDems to stop the idea of referendum.
Really wanted him on the Mets. But, its gonna be fun watching [NAME] try to catch [NAME] slider. 
Then stop arresting them for shooting at thieves
Maybe had a bad experience with [NAME]? But [NAME] and [NAME] still seemed like good friends what with [NAME] visiting the Solo set...
Drink. Watch hockey. Eat. That's what I do.
So happy for you two !! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Nyaw :) imagine all the nice things he‚Äôll have to brag about you to his next target.
I hope that stays on all their programs from now on. Would really add a new element to Corrie.

Nobody will ever dethrone nurses and teachers, but hotel employees are quietly becoming some of the weirdest people in my Tinder matches.
[NAME] and [NAME] made their own beds with their own actions. But I agree with this too .

Good for you! I wish I had run for my life at 18, but brainwashing is real
A little too nutty for me thx.
Exactly my point
Omg [NAME] he‚Äôs there because you don‚Äôt listen. You ass!
True but still very unlikely, mostly just vocal harassment and maybe a few small objects. Something tells me police will be there
Sorry misunderstood you! I‚Äôm talking about viruses and bacteria that can kill you like the flu etc
Typical verbal diarrhea from a cucked sheep. Good try though. B+ for effort.

Yeah probably. But the thought of [NAME] and [NAME] installing democracies instead of authoritarian dictatorships is utter nonsense.
Are you queuing with him and is your account a high level? Because if that is the case I suggest you make a Smurf.
As a closing TM, that‚Äôs terrifying. 
Let me translate: No. Find them yourself. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them think. But thank you for describing yourself.
I'm pretty excited to see how [NAME] develops. Appears that he could be a decent enough player in the future.
I spent a few months in LA and it freaked me out every time someone zoomed past me.

I understand this keeps many dairies afloat (source neighbourhood dairy guy, so not 100 per cent sure it‚Äôs accurate). 
Was really hoping he‚Äôd drive off with it (sigh)

I'm so sorry. This is no way to be live or be treated. It's so immature and emotionally-abusive. I really hope your circumstances improve
Just to tax a bit of the smug out of them would be worth it in itself.

I can relate to this so much.
[NAME] strange dreams. one life is enough

Tomorrow at 5-7pm Utc it says for me
Thank you /u/GarbagePailGrrrl!
my parents got engaged in the courtyard of [NAME] back in the 70s
Bah gawd, she is broken in half!
Oh cool! I don‚Äôt drink, but I‚Äôm sure a store would have some ready to throw out or something!
I agree. There's no denying he's handled it pretty badly, though.
I love this sub reddit üòçüòÇ
Agreed. There is r/clevercomebacks but this is just not even that.
But... I really like taking a time for myself
Celtic das really are a different breed. If this is how they react to one loss, our next title is going to be fun.
I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
the excitement when they all first come in always makes me happy
Now you move onto personal insults. Well done O king of the waffles. Once again using a word (nuance) with no context. Bored now.

Not a steal at all but thats about 100 times the amount he ever successfully defended
Wait, I saw this movie... [NAME] had 15 Dr. Peppers
I would love to be woken up by that
Very wholesome!
All I'm seeing here is that you commited a brutal murder.

That's beautiful and wholesome
Thanks! I'm now quite excited. Unless of course they all decide to skip straight from Chatswood to Gordon.
Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
I don't think that option in ranked would be a good idea.
My two favorite channels are Inner Integration and From Surviving to Thriving. Both have many videos, and they really get it.
I told [NAME] not to shoot [NAME] cause I didn‚Äôt think [NAME]‚Äô dumbass would turn his back right in front of her.

No, no the PTA has not disbanded!
The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won‚Äôt witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
The way it runs out of the water lmao
Yeah that's not nearly as dramatic and aggressive as the ball in the above video.
no job security and your prospects for future employment are severely hurt
Coloradon't is hilarious. I also thought of Rocky Mountain Lowpoint or Rocky Mountain Loser.
You're not missing anything, don't worry about it.
I don‚Äôt understand why you got a couple downvotes. I found your comment quite funny.
Well that‚Äôs sad. It might‚Äôve been funny if it was fake.
Maybe we'll just stop moderating for a while to celebrate TWOW.

Thanks for sharing your story. I hope you are doing okay now.

I wonder if your mother is proud of the person you became
Ah, cool cool cool
Yeah dude it is like a fertile egg - attacked by millions of sperm and only 1 gets to fertilize it. The other ones just die
yes but this is a crazy person. That's like telling Two-Face he doesn't have to flip a coin before committing a crime lol.
Seeing this makes me happy. I hope this is true :)
This must be what blasphemy laws felt like in the Middle Ages.
Ex's are ex's for a reason. Let it go man. For your sanity, let it go.

O don‚Äôt know man, I think they‚Äôre doing this for him, that looks great
I hate this.
I'm hoping that the TTK might help. He's really bad at R6 for the most part.
Time flies when you're a semiprofessional quotemaker. I wonder what he's up to these days.

[NAME] and [NAME] have a strange relationship, I can see them teaming up to go to Kings landing for vengeance together.
All children should be given the option to learn about how to effectively use the rights they‚Äôre entitled to.

Oh man this gave me some flashbacks to awesome times playing with my dad
It's bad that you're smoking weed. For minimal damage to your body, EDIBLES
This looks amazing. I'm sure Netflix will cancel the series in February.
I really liked [NAME] tbh
ooh a piece of candy
You should be proud. I hope that I'll have the will to keep myself held to such a standard when the time comes.
My point is that you followed this subreddit to watch videos like this and then comment and say it shouldn't exist. Are you thick?
If you really think a horror movie needs jump scares then I feel bad for you son.
Short, succinct, and perfect. It would be nice if the more of the world realized this simplicity of life.
Such a *great* feeling
Based on her other post she's young, pregnant and possibly homeless. Looking for help and advice.
Excellent find. Panels like these are a very deliberate writing choice.
She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life.
*shitty piece of fat
Worst in the country by far.
Thanks for keep us posted

If he saw it as something regrettable and possibly embarrassing, and has grown, eh. We all have something embarrassing in our past.

Do math and drive. I cook. Ain't much else to tell.
I was dying when he said we got to make love or be a crime
Like have an anti interventionist foreign policy.
It's the same with librarians. Out someplace, see someone with a confused look, and that autopilot kicks in. 
Other nations still have gangs/organized crime, but yet guns aren‚Äôt as easily to obtain.

I love how Chapotraphouse links directly to neoliberal
These shows are scripted
It can be safely backdodged in duels because of its lackluster tracking. Avoids feint to gb too. People just dodge at the wrong timings.
You didn't watch it to the end.
In the short term, yes.

If they did, they wouldn't be LURKERS LURKIN'
This joke has been on here a million times and never ceases to trick me
They made the same few songs over and over again. Problem is I love those songs so I'm not too bothered. Personally love them.

For every Undertale or Stardew Valley there's dozens, if not hundreds of other games developers put their heart and soul to, but never catch on.

Yeah take it slow..I mean you waited 7 years you can wait a bit. Hope it will turn out good for you guys
Which you ultimately pay for in higher insurance premiums, court costs, etc. Dealing with big problems like this is a net positive for everyone.
I wish they‚Äôd get [NAME] but only down side is his defense and being a skinny boi
Who are these women messaging [NAME]? He looks like a very average-looking teenager.
This can‚Äôt be considered cruelty free because now someone‚Äôs hair style is gonna suffer

[NAME] is great, I love [NAME] content as well.
Not sure but I imagine it's the liquid. The gel is just gelatin.
Apologies, sir
Where do you plan to go?
Yep, regardless how people feel about this benign ad, it has generated 6.9 million views and countless posts. It's a resounding success.

You are laughable, you will defend this backup until he's gone.
Fun fact: the guy who made Napster is now one of the main folks of Spotify.
I don't envy people who earned what they have. I respect them. I'm jealous of people who are born or marry into money.
"As in when totalitarians show up in solidarity with those ""normal"" people? If you're attracting ANTIFA, you're not normal."

Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
Most of the people commenting in /r/Libertarian aren't libertarians, but are just there to tell libertarians how stupid and evil they are.
They do get an awful lot of upvotes, so they seem to have at least some support from others.

18-21 age range and it was a little over 2 years long
very interesting hill to die on
The Colts badly wanted to hire him. He‚Äôd get a GM job in a heartbeat if he wanted it.
Yeah no problem. Sorry about that.
No insults.
Oh this is that one he posted a while back with the dinosaur and flowers ü§¢
Cough dm from cvs same as delsym
Sad truth is you cant run away from who you are no matter how hard you try :(
Sounds like you are dealing with some difficult mental health issues. Parents generally love their children. maybe try to talk to them??
And someone downvoted you for that smh
I like how the [NAME] stood there like what the fuck and then just accepted his death.
Your paranoia over it seems schizophrenic to me. Just in case you are not, please elaborate on why this is important to society.
It's a cruel, uncaring universe we live in. Fingers crossed things won't completely fall apart for them.
[NAME] why are there so many guendouzi haters?
Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôll probably just smoke, as you said, once maybe twice a month. Thanks again!
Naw man that‚Äôs my stove, I just wish I had a carrot ü•ï for y‚Äôall
It is designed that way, but curiously, some of the color options are not worn
I have already played with one friend, and we get along. But there was another guy i haven't played with before.
You'd have to explain what that means to you first. It's such a nebulous phrase it's never meant much of anything to me.
"Must be sad that you waste your time idolizing ""Pros"" and being a absolute poser in front of your freinds "
Just tried and I was able to register it. I got the first Juul from the same place too and that charger worked fine
But the poster, on the other hand...
Yeah a lot of people are missing that lol
Thank you! I will!
Oh come on mom..it's 2019.
Yeah, but most people who have body pillows don't have girlfriends so can we really use this as a good example
*‚ÄùBetter videotape it for that sweet IRL karma. Look at how generous I am, people! I am so humble.‚Äù*
Well he hasn‚Äôt dont anything good ever. So sorry I‚Äôm not very excited about this trade.
You made me cry. That rarely happens, it's like poetry. Someone gets me. Someone feels my pain. Thank you.
I didn't say it was soulless.
No. There's a fair amount of nudity, violence and foul language. 
So is being overweight
They don't seem to care much. Al qaida or ahrar al sham makes little difference anyway.
"I couldn't get my wife on board. She insists on eating a ""real dinner""."
I don't like this gif and that makes me a [NAME] supporter? My argument has not once brought him up. You are an insidious liar.
Gonna hazard a guess they adversely affected the Saints worse.
"[NAME] was the ""socialist"" freshman House Rep. I liked the most, but her recent [NAME] tweets are extremely concerning."
Sorry I haven't been keeping up to date, what happens next week?
That is the most bizarre story. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a joke.
If push comes to shove the easy alternative is you show up for work and take up space but don't actually perform your job.
Tight tight tight
Can you spend a week reviewing ? That is totally what I would do. Come up with some fun games you can play.
I didn‚Äôt know I could roll my eyes this far into my head
She thinks you're getting back together. That's what happened. For both you and her, go back to no contact.
The most invisible colour OF ALL!
Yeah no one is gonna do that and get reported to HR for bigotry.
I too live in logan square and cant for life of me find it on this map
Now that's job dedication. May we all raise a pizza roll to this cameraman.
Astrology and asttonomy used to be the same thing. The scientific aspect diverged and got renamed to astronomy to distance itself from the bullshit.
I did. Thank you for your opinion.
You are welcome, I have faced lot of sibling related issues. Hope things work out well for you.
üòÖ sorry. Lol
At least it isn't too terrible? Actually it's not bad at all. Still VERY delusional!! Good post
Sorry thought you were the other guy that said it was a privilege.
I hate that you've forced me to deal with a reality I've been blissfully ignoring.
it's funny how conservatives always say that leftists get angry over everything when conservatives get angry over a starbucks cup or a brown man existing
You're giving fascism too much credit here. They were backed by capitalists in the first place because it was profitable. It's those two together.
Funny when I hear people claim a breed is dangerous, I automatically assume they are trash.
Especially because [NAME] best piece of comedy on the whole show was her impersonation of Shangela's [NAME].
Nobody is ever the only one to think anything.
Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the worst for her
A couple things: Fuck Nazism. Enjoy the ban for trolling!
"Did you guys notice that one of the headlines on the magazine from the last act said ""A real life marvel"" I loved that little detail honestly"
Nurse is by far the most loyal team mate we have!
Yes, In the edit, after I already made my comment. 
Yeah maybe they'll finally get a shred of evidence in another two years haha
I read on a different post that he died shortly after of internal injuries.
More accurate, relevant map
User name says you are a scumbag [NAME]. I‚Äôm confused
Ouch, that hurts, would've won without the injury
Claw since AW and logged a fuck ton of hours and no discomfort
Poor and lonely.
Not OP, but this is a really great response and I'm saving it on my computer for a rainy day. Thank you.
General malaise is a favourite. I get a lot of general malaise.
Lol. 'have meat on my bones and I'm thick'. Just 'overweight' will do, Captain Redundant.
This post is amazing. Definitely starting to see good days and life just kept improving after my Nex. Thank you for this
Friends for eternity! Loyalty, honesty!
[NAME] doesn't even like sex. Remember, you said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
"I like this one, it's not a ""when you"" meme."
I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .
I understand that. My question is more if anyone would be excited for it or interested in helping
Boomers ruined the world
You sound like you have a warped view of what makes someone strong and an overblown, distorted sense of your own masculinity. 
The frequency with which I hear ‚Äúgone overseas to defend our country‚Äù without a hint of irony should be criminal in itself
The molcajete is my favorite type of Mexican food. I'm not with you on this one.
They are loving this choice in maga canada of course. Just a typical day of bigotry.
Fly, you fool!
This reminds me of the wallpaper someone posted here a while back, great pic OP!
Nobody would be ecstatic to be on welfare.
I only watched a few episodes, but I loved that guy.
I like [NAME] and would like to see him back, but he still makes me nervous at a high price too. 
its pretty wholesome tho
Just show her highlight videos on YouTube from the past 2 seasons.
I feel you, names are the worst. 
It wouldn‚Äôt even have been a month yet though... I can‚Äôt believe this bootlicking nonsense is upvoted here. [NAME] supporters everywhere these days smh
Imagine my shock
Hopefully [NAME] falls to 6. [NAME] can start the season and when the time is right move on over to the rookie
The worst is ‚Äòget in a group with someone you don‚Äôt already know‚Äô
His takeover run out haha
I believe he had just recently revived his learners permit and the kid ran a red light.
Wish you did more. Sounds like she deserved worse.
[NAME] is such a wholesome woman. The world needs more people like her.
The left has hurt itself in its confusion!
That‚Äôs the hardest part for some to get over, but hobbies help and getting yourself up and out of the house and spending time with friends
Always...really. married 31 years and she still turns me on!
4th generation representing!
Maybe time to see a doctor or psychologist? Although a bit of social anxiety is normal and not necessarily the disorder.
Haha so give it a try is what you are saying üòÇüòÇ
Like that little pony who was trotting for his life, saying, ‚ÄúOh shit oh shit oh shit!‚Äù
I do crazy‚Äô I love to clean man. Just have fun. Or at least try.
> Society usually paints men as emotionless, cold, and self sustaining creatures who don't need affection. Not really, though.
Hope all is well now xo
This a very obvious joke. Also the old facepalm picture doesn't make your post better.
It‚Äôs always nice to say something [nice]!
He had a hat trick with Cruz Azul in what I think was his debut in the CONCACAF Champions League. Really wish he was given more of a chance
Yah a couple years been together for 7 total...we are in healthcare
His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
Talking is a free action.
That‚Äôs so precious and sweet üò≠
Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.
A bad pun can be a real pick-me-up
The diagonal photo is killing me. Why is it like that?
Nice, thanks!!
Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan. 
Sure dude. Although I‚Äôd say my rate at dispensing profound wisdom is lesser than the rate at which I can talk utter BS haha
Love the fact that the security guard or whatever he was made him roll down the passenger window instead of walking around to the drivers side, lol.
Nice, I saw them during the Demo and was pretty impressed 
What does FPTP have to do with the referendum?
We've had so many stories about [NAME], that we do NOT need any about Florida lady. LOL
That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
If you're talking about tfue you're insane. He plays scrims for hours, every, single day. 
Beside the scene , the quality of the video was magnificent
Sorry, I wish I was wrong, but Mathews is over rated
Can't stand having sex with you...?? Just horrible thing to say... You deserve better!!!
She said on the VR Aftershow that she had hooked up with girls and had a relationship with a girl before.
Spoiler: I think they mean me, even though I would hope that is literally the opposite of what my comments have been doing. 
That‚Äôs horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
What's the name of the artist that featured him? Can't remember it
Just delt with the bank the other day. They did the exact same thing.
Always on the back of my mind when that's the last thing I want.
[NAME] what the hell is going on at hq
I thought they held hands while they and [NAME] were watching TV ([NAME] was pretending to be sick in that episode)?
And the douche social media obsessed guy who left the used condom on the side table!
America will lose. You are mentally-deranged and the enemy.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more
The EU's 'red lines' are in treaty and legislation. The UK's red lines are just May's opinions, they could disappear in two minutes.
I much prefer when the CB is given a taste of their own medicine. Far more satisfying than being polite. This one is great!
I love it when they have those realistic conversations where people interrupt eachother and talk over eachother. It makes it more relatable
It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.
I feel like I say this a lot but I wish we'd run the mudiay frank back court more, I like their chemistry together
"It actually amazes me how often children are more sensible than adults. Maybe it's because they haven't been corrupted by ""real life"" yet."
[NAME] really getting roasted every chance. I think he is just misunderstood. I hope he shows up.
I don't know about you but parroting racist lies created specifically to devalue AM sexuality is a pretty serious indicator of racism to me.
Good dad, manipulative son.
Oh thank you for the name, is there any way to get rid of them? 
Ofc he'd say that, he's already rich 
I'm sorry :( I hope this year ends up being incredible for you in ways you never anticipated, to make up for it. Hugs.
Thanks. 22-23 is about when Chabad bochurim tend to do semichah. And it's officially always done before marriage.
I really only do this after a while if awkward silence, which may make it even more awkward tbh
What‚Äôs the clip from? I‚Äôm scared to put ‚Äúteen boy good kisser 900 number‚Äù into YouTube
EVERYTHING in a house that smoked in, will smell like smoke
This isnt an exaggeration? üôÑ
Viral marketing for [NAME] new tour?
People need to want democracy in its raw form though. We're too tribalistic for that.
Then he'll spend your worth plus some, or ...
I personally prefer FIT to refer to these kinds of transphobes: Feminist-Identifying Transphobe.
I have too much hair on my body to do this.
Thank you! That is the goal!
"[NAME]: ""S that D! Shut it down!"""
Wow! How does it know?
Very legal and cool
Sony, for similar design on generic game controllers.
Well if we just started in the second quarter in both games...we would have come out ahead!
That‚Äôs why this team sucks. People are still paying to see them, so upper management has nothing to worry about. 
Sounds like not a typical 1/3 hand ...
Lol, good luck with that, kid.
Have you talked to him about it and made it clear he understands where you are coming from?
Man, I assumed it was already out and I'd missed it.
Can‚Äôt stand that dwarfism [NAME] she is so cringe
Imagine running willingly into a new pair of broken ribs.
Police can amend docs, they can‚Äôt change them. Even if it‚Äôs a name
I think it has more to do with them deriving a sense of identity from work. Remove the work and what remains?
Ooh, and then put bear DNA in the next one! I have a theory I wanna test...
This is great and Elephant is pretty fun. We went to the clown exhibit last month.
It looks like Marvin the Martian's ship. I'm still geeked as hell though. Also glad they provided a space suit for scale.
What did you use to kill them all? Sorry I‚Äôm kinda a noob
thank you for your answer
Same here man, terrible feeling
With all those hours he spends humping his thesaurus, looking back on posts would be virtually impossible.
That's a very interesting theory and it makes sense. How does it gel with the fact that we clearly know the timeline changed?
Something Is wrong with your account then. The auctions I win get plastered all over my email and app notifications.
Can you please make one for ps4 with (movie) [NAME], [NAME], and Palp please?
Can you imagine not being able to pick your nose THE WHOLE GAME ! Those poor bastards.
OMG thank you. Just thank you all
If your maternal grandmother is [RELIGION], so are you. Not having ceremonies doesn't change that.
Lol you know what makes me happy? All of your guys negativity. Keep it up everyone :) it just makes me happier
They just made an ad that made men out to be some sort of deranged sub-human, incapable of understanding right and wrong
I am glad that you‚Äôre doing well, it‚Äôs a difficult process but incredibly rewarding, I imagine. Best of luck on your journey! 
In what manner?
According to imƒÅm [NAME], zanadiqa should be killed with no opportunity to repent. 
(insert [NAME] meme) THEFT?!
Ned Stark: Dead Stark
That's cute love it!
That isn't the ideal female body nor is it /fit/ That's a fetish
Calm down kid jeez
"I want a shirt that says ""Brilliant, Beautiful, Ferocious, Thing"". That's power."
I literally teared up reading this. That poor, poor guy. He has a great attitude, but that's heartbreaking.
Agreed, especially considering so many pets that were once given as a gift are abandoned later anyway.
I see.. so people are just guessing?
evolve groove spines, or ask [NAME]
Calling Hollywood...would make a great movie.‚ò∫
The last three words any redditor wants to hear lmao
It's even worse when you get someone from NJ who has no clue how to drive in the city environment.
Way too small, what a bummer. 
I agree with [NAME]. I'd read the mention of intimacy as just bait for rinsing.
Goose don‚Äôt give a fuck
Can someone tell me how he protects his virginity though. You know from all the thots.
Luckily I don‚Äôt like beer so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that.. but my love for bread more than makes up for that!
Papa Johns in my area basically gives away their pizza. I can smell the desperation in the store
um what. no. not hmc.
OP, u/christiangreyisdraco and u/lurkerturndcommenter, thank you for trying to make the point about focus. I appreciate your many attempts!
Rash sun [NAME] dropping out of the first round?
Omfg. I haven‚Äôt seen this one before, and I‚Äôm in tears! Thank you! 
CBD dog treats. They‚Äôve worked wonders for my dog when it comes to fireworks.
Such lovely humans here. Have fun with that type of attitude
My crypto was pending when the site went dark. We'll see I guess but I've kissed that money goodbye in my head.
I'm praying they get a spin-off. Keep this crap off my VPR.
Smh at least you know if you ever do anything with her to always get it in writing and notarized!!!
Careful we don‚Äôt talk about that here. I‚Äôm enjoying a ban from LegalAdvice lmao
Not unexpected this election was gonna be a brawl between him and [NAME] from the start.
Ha. She cried because you influenced it.
"Claims to be ""against sexist [NAME] bros"" Hires a sexual abuser as her top advisor"
The hell? That‚Äôs like one-in-a-million chance! Only thing that‚Äôd make it crazier is if we‚Äôre in the same city lol
She did.
I love the Justice Democrats so much
The montage of a man's career, there's so much said in these photos it is incredible.
Thanks for reminding me to never live in NYC
Check out Round Planet on Netflix - you won't be sorry
It‚Äôs not clear to me that vulnerability functions as an ethical compass. Will table further replies in deference to a culture war thread.
Nah just good drag henny. They paint for the back of the room.
Okay, two men's fault.
all 10‚Äôs left tbh hoping for a clarity win, we found love second, rather be third, and titanium fourth
Same, I'm really struggling to not become feminine because of that.
I love snow! It means snow days!
Can't speak for the original commenter but probably not yours since I'd rather not be tortured for eternity for disbelief.
lol yep that is the case and has same taste in food as well!
[NAME] ! Glad that we helped you.
Resident complainers complaining about the resident weirdos preemptively. Classic Reddit.
Thank you so much for this link, watching [NAME] was an absolute delight! 
thank you!
That's unfortunate but can't blame that lawyer for doing his job.
ROOMS TO GO LOUNGE TIME
> You first. Really. I have. I reject both, but I can do it separately because they're not necessarily correlated beliefs.
You should watch DS9. It's fantastic, and has a long story arc to follow.
And those poor kids are still paying for it. And we have actual grown adults that are bullying them even today.
I wish I could get this kind of funny stuff sent to me on Snapchat. All I ever get are bobs and vagene.
You know, ive always wondered how a car could get in a position like that
Its natural to fear what is unknown. Especially when someone is trying to force you to open a sketchy box while probably grinning the whole time.
I am really sorry for you, but oh my [NAME] this made me cry laughing. I hope the cat learns to like you eventually
You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.
#I BELIEVE IN [NAME]
The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD.
There are dozens of us.
#YOU'RE RIGHT, PEOPLE BEING OUTRAGED BY THE ACTIONS OF A CRIMINAL IS HYSTERICAL!
So you don‚Äôt agree with having success, self-worth and self-respect, and a purpose in life?
Yeah you're right. That's the problem. Not guys thinking it's ok to message someone they haven't matched with outside of Tinder.
That‚Äôs kind of what makes the ‚Äúguest‚Äù response funny, how did it get there?
Thank you üôÇ
No, I generally feel like slugging them in the head repeatedly with an iron bar. Spitting is just petty. *Let your hatred flow!*
That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
[NAME] & [NAME]? Also, his ass is as big as her back. 
Hurr durr everyone needs to worry about other people‚Äôs problems
Lmao he did that at the concert i went to and said that it was the first time hes ever seen it
Lmao!!! ü§£ He does look rather greasy.
That's not [NAME]. That's [NAME]. His family founded this country.
I wake up as a girl everyday. A girl with a penis, huge hands, hair like fucking everywhere, no tiddy, and an unwelcome boner.
[NAME] take a biology class you social darwinist scum.
Oooo sounds lovely. Armpit hair on ‚Äúfleek‚Äù
Understandable. Retail sucks and people are nut
At least it's ok in public & around children.
Yes. It's a good trigger for discussion to move past [NAME] model, though.
Edgy bro.
I have listened to him and that's how I know he's a terrible person and his goal is to turn impressionable people into terrible people like himself.
If [NAME] gets 350M+ from anyone we should be glad we didn't get him.
weird. I can see it properly. [NAME] - Finally
He showed how easy it is to get into a team and gain fame.
Always look before you jump.
Haha I actually didn't know about its existence! I honestly wonder how much of that map I've actually seen though. So many hours. Lol
Thanks, didn't catch that one!
Even this tweet reeks just from the description provided (and the way her friends must look/smell). I‚Äôm gagging.
As someone with a newborn, thank you so much! Good tip to have for sure!
I appreciate your honesty.
He's so intimidating...
They're a match made in heaven!
[NAME] got a serious case of the giggles today.
Who said i was a kid?
FQ looks pretty good so far. Do not disrespect Notorious POB.
I don't think it's age related, we all forget how much newborns suck. If we didn't we'd stop having babies.
Did someone turn u down? Is this revenge?
Tonight's attempt at installing gib on ceiling ended with me in tears, damaged gib and still 2/3 of the ceiling left to go. FML.
what lmao get a grip dude
ITS A GOOD BOI!!
been there dont remember where exactly it is but so much fun
Not defending [NAME] at all but this is just super sad if it‚Äôs true...
This video is funny but every time I watch it I get so mad at the guys filming and their belittling comments!
Beat me to it. Just because the news makes it seem like there is a pandemic of school shootings, it is exceedingly unlikely to happen.
The rape of one? Millions of women have been raped. Rape and murder is also a tool of war.
Are you able to see a therapist or counselor?
My parents always checked on us to make sure we were breathing, they always panicked if they didn‚Äôt hear us making sounds.
DUP have just said they're voting for confidence in the government. Tory MPs won't put their selections in jeopardy. There won't be a GE.
When people are insecure, they'd rather have somebody who is strong and wrong than someone who's weak and right, - [NAME]
makes sense...except it doesn't.
I didnt really think about having a wife as an object until recently in a bout of frustration induced fantasy.
I apologise, I'm a bit hot headed at times, especially on this account.
I had a young woman patient who was repeatedly found on the floor, naked and masturbating.
And he‚Äôs been with same org with his former teammates before Vegas. That and highly doubt [NAME] would drop a loyal player.
Taking a charge up 30. I love this team
Old dirty Bastard?
Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad.
"Hence I used ""weird"". I know it's awkward, but it was indoctrinated into us growing up."
You come off as very cold and uncaring there.
Kitchens use bacteria floor cleaner it would almost definitely make you sick
He is better at public relations than the previous popes but he is basically just as bad when it comes to not punishing pedophiles
Yup and those 2 supposedly intervened in Pennsylvania according to some theories, going against the idea that passengers downed the flight
That's not what is being contested here. Telling your kid something like this would certainly make you a bitch.
Mother knows best.
This is great in contrast to the [NAME] and [NAME] drama
Men, you're ought to love the first hour in hospital of a new father. They're a merge of emotions that flow over the ER.
Lmao I listen to stuff that doesn't fit in any of these categories Oh, and grandson
What? No way, I thought ragnarok mobile was a pretty small game holy shit
His loss! A child is the most precious thing life has to offer. Good riddance, you deserve better.
Bringing the country down with the government.
Thanks for comin' out.
Because you're not making one in any coherent way. As such, I'm done. 
I‚Äôm just shitposting dude. In the spirit of the thread ‚ÄúI was bored‚Äù
No, you won the 23rd.
If y'all didn't like OKC before, you hate 'em now.
It‚Äôs shocking isn‚Äôt it? I paid less for a flight from London to Manchester than it would have cost for the train.
What a loser, sad. 
Considering it‚Äôs a much deserved promotion I can‚Äôt be mad in the slightest.
thanks, got traded from the habs and I remembered liking his game during pre season, was wondering why he got sent down. oh, and fuck [NAME]
How many wins are they into those ranks and at what winrate. Regardless thanks for the info.
Softest fans in sports
Why? I love it.
He must've done something real bad. I played with a guy who by all counts was an asshole but never received more than mutes.
Love takes work and commitment. If it's not worth the work it isn't love. Learned that one from my blood family.
I've been twice and both locations had a serious bee problem.
xD Add it to the meme list guys
I want a salad!
So it *was* you I saw in the window in De Wallen, then? :D
Idk what's so unrealistic about it. [NAME] is probably just as close to [NAME] as [NAME] and [NAME] are.
I pirate anything I want to watch that is not on those platforms
Plenty of places to build more damns in the WCape actually. Damn's are not the way forward? What do you propose?
Nah i‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs reasonable enough to be in mildlyinteresting.
Tetris effect?
Looks fade, having a partnership with people that love and care about each other doesn't have to.
Lmao that's a funny coincidence
I *demand* satisfaction
Oh my [NAME].
I still have empathy because she's a human with a family. Every bigots are human.
Knew someone at that actual party, according to them he was talked into doing it by Odd Future members not sure who tho
Yes it does count
You're not wrong
Florida seems to have our number and if [NAME] is out we are screwed . 3-1 FL
Lol same.
Very possible but there's absolutely zero indication were working on a deal to trade [NAME] currently. We're not just going to trade him away for peanuts.
You're right and I hate it.
Doubt that. Skins for [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] don't change the shape of their wings, so why should they for [NAME]?
It's like an Arts school but with dangerous, easily weaponizable spells being flung all over the place!
Wow dude get a life and stop digging through my comments trying to pick a fight like a belligerent moron.
How did I miss that?
You can just say grownups use lubrica ... ^ohhh
Only all the time. As of a few years ago it‚Äôs been impossible for me to do it, which is discomforting to say the least.
Cuz some things could become brittle and break...
I believe they know about it and don‚Äôt care, but they aren‚Äôt paying someone that doesn‚Äôt work there to do it.
Just keep trying. Dont give up! If you are getting numbers that is half the battle...seriously.
Guy quotes [NAME] lol. Juicy
The monster!
Ugh, this fucking tumblr account. I posted about this bitch before, they wrote that [NAME] drug rehab fanfiction.
Toxic masculinity' is as anti-man as 'gangrenous arm' is anti-limb Less so, in fact
Ha ha. You can't define something into existence.
My all time favorite band!!! Now my son listens to them and [NAME]!
That's such a well said last sentence...
I'll need a weeaboo-English dictionary to understand what was said.
Eat the apple butthole first. It's the best way to eat the apple.
maybe they are even going places together ;)
my first thought was Superstar!
Yeah, and [NAME] is not the guy he initially accused of murder. I'm not sure what the confusion is here
Same here. The ones who know me and my obsession always let me know and it makes me happy.
I didn't think it was that bad ><
nah, my face is the farthest thing possible from cute ;-;
What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
[NAME] got that vision
Who the hell has all these power tools but no hammer
 a link to the Stape article referenced in that thread, it's a good read
I understand why she is an ex now.
I don't have children yet so I will just have a long conversation with my balls tonight
*[NAME]* has some weird guerrilla marketing going on.
r/forhonor leaking again?
What was it?
Guys help I can‚Äôt stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!
ugh their mind
The worst Alabama loss under [NAME]. It was a good day.
OK OK WE GOT IT
Obviously a flying monkey somewhere. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm glad you cut him out of your life.
Nikon D5100 with a 55-300mm lense. Still don't know how to use it well. Edit: Thanks! Edit again: A word.
"The point of an Umeshism is that 'half-baked' is often optimal, or as [NAME] put it, ""Anything worth doing is worth doing badly."""
Lmao your posts are always good for an eye roll
I fixed it.
Aww!! Thank you! I had fun making it, I also ADORE [NAME] üòç
Dude it's not even 11am yet. Most of the University students and young professionals who comment in this sub are either at work or at school.
I submitted my resignation on October 6th.
OK this dude isn't over 16, good luck at prom
Yeah very true
My face imitated the Pikachu meme for a long time...

yeah violence shouldn't be your goto first option, but the people who pretend words are meaningless sounds are stupid idiots
[NAME] had a record for not scoring goals for several matches in a row with [NAME] as coach. Never mind that [NAME] was pretty awful during his time at Porto.
Thanks. Ive edited to include the Prophet SalAllahualaihi wasallam. i meant 'people' as in the general people in our lives.
I hope she lives to be 200, just to piss them off.

Ik man. I probably would too, even though it would probably lead to my death... best of luck to you friend. I hope you find happiness
Tell [NAME] it was me....

So I‚Äôm not invested for the rest of the season. Wife is, though. Go Bears.

Who should I keep? 1 keeper. .5 PPR ten teams [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
yeah i misread billions as millions. my bad
Why does everything have to be a debate?
This is actually a really good idea
Well somebody has to balance the books... the Liberals never even try.
I feel left out cuz I don‚Äôt get this, can someone explain 
No, I don't mind all that much. I just hate being subjected to second hand carcinogens
Thank you! That's the explanation I was looking for.
We all got our thing hun. Embrace it.
luckily i do not have mixxed cycles myself... rapid cycling, sure, not mixed episodes though. sending hope your way!!
Best summary of the situation right here.
If I‚Äôm ever like that, suffocate me with a pillow.
Being someone who has severe anxiety and in this predicament before, you need to do what‚Äôs best for YOU
They do throw you in jail if you go way too fast or get too many tickets
The overall response is try and empower women, abolish prostitution and stop giving lazy men money because they want to live out their idiotic fantasy lives. 
I like how his actual clone comes running up to him to congratulate him on that recovery
What do you mean by verified transactions?
You‚Äôre buying a hipster truck then demanding INVOICE PORT PDICE. If they don‚Äôt broom you won‚Äôt get a survey for sure lol
I‚Äôm not attracted enough to her for me to ask her out, but I would have sex with if she wanted 
What‚Äôs all this [NAME] business? Edit: Thanks for the info below everyone üòá
Kraft is the wrong kind of ass though. Even the generic stuff is better than kraft.
Sometimes i don't even comment anymore, i think if something is actually worth my time or anyone's for that matter.
Which one?
Thanks, so that's not what I need then.
Happy birthday and cake day! I hope you find a little bit of joy somewhere in your journey today.
Well that's an awful superpower to have. Maybe you could fix [NAME] tho.
I would love to find a like minded boyfriend but I given up on that already...
Cuteness!!!!!
Take some time to ponder why you fancy yourself intelligent when you revel in pedantry and can't even understand such a simple point.
Get out of here with this, dude.
I love people like this that don't understand how taxes work...
"We had 3 whole pallets of this one doll and I'm like ""wtf"" so I checked and the location said 8000 something lmao."
chippy chippy ball
You sound like a douche.
Can‚Äôt die alone if you got yourself
I clearly did mean she was being held back by SHD. Thanks for pointing it out! I guess that was missed (?)
on the subject of meltdowns, stay calm yourself and try your best not to escalate them.
"""Being able to attract women"" shouldn't be the only way you rate how good a person is. That's ridiculous."
It's tasty. Had one on bone marrow once. I've had weirder things before
You mean pan de huevo Check food city
I hope it goes just as well. Good luck.
Nice to see someone actually posted something useful here. :D Thanks!
For cart pushers, I can‚Äôt recommend getting good winter/rain gear highly enough. Good socks and waterproof/resistent shoes will make a world of difference.
I have a 4 inch penus and $27. Do I win?
[NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
LOL, once in a lifetime. Sheesh, this sub is obsessed
But he got to play with future Hall of Fame QB [NAME]!!!
I use one every time I park and you just replied to me. so this is a bit awkward.
cool, gonna check this game now
Sweety she called it P.H.A.T. Cause mawma ain't nothing wrong with being P.H.A.T okur.
Yup, it may not look like much but it‚Äôs still statistically significant. That‚Äôs really bad for something being decided by a coin toss.
Am I *wooshing*? I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a patriarchy in the US
I need therapy but I‚Äôm too scared to go to therapy.
I once described how sometimes my fart bubbles travel up my labia to an ex and he was so grossed out XD

So either the dog is sick or the owner has non-trivial mental illnesses.
[NAME] I‚Äôm so sorry sweety
Expect the unexpected
nice!! I'll try this one
I think it is worth documenting this sort of stuff, as a reminder. They'd do this to your kids too. In a heartbeat.
Trolls are not even trying anymore. Im offended by this half arsed attempt to get a rise out of me..
I adore this. It gave me so many chills of happiness!
I either know you, or know someone who has done the exact same thing. Either way I hope that makes you feel better xD
Seeing him RT rev gave me some hope which hurts worse
Nope. According to your biblical book of lies [NAME] made **everything**. Are you saying the bible is false?
Bump stocks too I guess, I can't imagine why he actually did that though, perhaps his advisors told him to do it to pander
Problem is that picture is there before you ever set foot in the cabin; [NAME] put it there. Just makes it creepy.
I was in awe the whole hour I spent in there.
Good job, white truck! Don't use the damn shoulder to pass!
I enjoy being a girl. (are shutdown memes still allowed? ...No matter. Couldn't find a decent one for this)
Good luck [NAME]
Another reunion pic!!! made me lol
Hey fellow conservative, you seem concerned. 
It's been cross posted.
And mass migration
He's talking about the semifinal game between Bama and Clemson which Bama won 24-6
What does that even mean? How does one decide right or wrong with something so vague?
Like and share
Do you mean they will win 3 championships in 58 years? Otherwise I don‚Äôt understand your comment.
Give it time.
It was funny until they started to diss on chick fil a
Yes. Wait until recreational marijuana is legalised federally. Portugal could legalize all drugs including cocaine, but they are a small country.
In the era of [NAME], and to a lesser extent [NAME], I‚Äôm not sure this is a bad thing.
My girl [NAME]. Love that our names are the same bless
Imagine discovering time travel and you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhi, im famous now‚Äù 
No, but now I will
I love that [NAME] knows to have both hands visible in the photo with that young girl. Better safe than sorry.
Be careful, it‚Äôs a slippery slope. Alcohol isn‚Äôt fixing your problem, it‚Äôs just hiding it.
Not really, the save file has nothing to do with the engine.
Oohhh so you go to school on a military base? Is your mom or dad in the military or both?
On the bright side, anyone dumb enough to do this would quickly be buried in a hail of well-deserved poor reviews.
I'm tired, but I can't sleep.
Pins are given out? My store hordes that shit like there‚Äôs a coming apocalypse and pins are the only thing that will save them.
Maybe if you live in America.
He was not my boyfriend then, duh. 
I'm not on it I was just wondering for the sake of knowing.
He says he still loves me and wants me in his life. He cant bear to deal with the guilt he feels over Girl being jealous.
yeah, that sounds about right. [NAME] [NAME] come in here and downvote this to hell for being mean
Barista Parlor and Crema have been my favorite so far.
These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
Zero chance. Jeeze.
I love the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sleeping‚Äù and then the realization
Wait.....What? You do know that's not how it works, right?
Weird but interesting nonetheless.
You can pry my eggs from my cold, dead, artery-clogged hands.
I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. Are you feeling okay now? Thank you for the concern. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Really glad you were there for her. I wish you both the best.
The dense stuff isn't very accessible. :/
I didn‚Äôt know that existed. Thanks, stranger.
I'm betting my life savings she makes it all the way through and gets a relative happy ending :)
LOL yes, this guy might not be too bright. 
"Female here - Personally, I would love a text that says ""I had a good time tonight! Would love to see you again."""
That's so amazing! I am happy for you both!
ill [NAME] has already phoned his imaginary boss in for sick leave, [NAME] the [NAME] has patched ASDA. Man the Twitter barricades: they‚Äôre coming!
Sometimes it even feels pathetic which I know I should be trying not to be so hard on myself but, yknow, evidence is hard to ignore
You must be wrong, because this is the sub for intelligent people!!! 
Yeah I agree people on reddit are so extra it's annoying

*Emotionally* we're winning 10-0
It has been a good snow and bad avalanche season in the rockies. Haha, thin and tight, just how i like‚Äòem.
I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
Nope. But if this also occurs in Dallas, that‚Äôs quite disheartening. :(
No it's not. I'd bet his biggest crime was being an introvert. Low-inhibition psychos never seem to lack for female companionship.
I‚Äôm more worried about the dude getting pissed all over my shoes
I‚Äôve never seen such dramatic tongue involvement.
Ah, the original turd burger.
You see benevolent, I see cynical and morally bankrupt.
My drunken eyes saw that last window as [NAME] and im not sure if its better or worse
My girlfriend barely tolerates me showering in the morning, she'd be furious if I'd let an alarm ring while I'm away. And rightfully so. 
From where I was it looked like the plane banked right past the 505 on its second pass through downtown. Crazy.
Pay couples to have kids. I'm not sure if the incentives apply to single moms.

He is in [NAME] team. He bend a knee and give up the North because fall in love with her. As script said.
Personally, I adore capitalism. But that's just me.

You think her being a [NAME] is the reason for the hatred? Really?
Yes. Some shows get canceled before they can even finish the season
This guy has the charisma and sex appeal of overcooked noodles.

Hell yeah my dude. And the best part is, if I had the money, I could get either or both of those right now :)
19 is still considered a teen right? If so, here I am! At least until March. 
my favourite singer ([NAME]) helped write one of the songs so i love it
What happened that she was so pissed and did this live?
Downvoting comments you don't like is your right.
That's really not that long ago given his age and this sort of thing is more than controversial.

Nonsense. People are either the best or the worst. All of the time.
After this conversation, he never found the answer and every day was the same, day in, day out.
The majority is not relevant: it was advisory. I agree a second vote is needed to kill the [NAME] trope.
UNLESS THEY ARE ABUSIVE OR IT'S AN LDR!
Wow, they charge you to sign in the delivery too? They don‚Äôt make us do that in PA.
Just you. All my other senses open up, so my vision _changes_ but i'm still eyes open

Thanks for saying that, but yeah: you really need to do something about your boy there. He‚Äôs not right.

Good luck my tw broskies :(
Fortunately, those defibs only require being able to read to operate, so that means a good 5% of most corporate drones could run one.
Do you want help?
I loved how [NAME] feels like everyone in the office is her family. Her relationship with [NAME] is so cute and innocent
Outside of Reddit the Democrat base has definitely not gotten more progressive.

If my mom were still alive, she'd be so pissed at [NAME] being in this cast.
[NAME] redeemed herself!!

This is disgusting. *secretly gets horny* I've had it with this sub. *opens new incognito tab*

Whoooo...doggie! That‚Äôs some purty chili!
Still doesn't apply. 5 hits from [NAME] will do way more than 6 hits from [NAME]. Quality vs quantity.
When I die Im gonna ask satan for a job in hell whipping all these cunts
True. Guys who are legitimately ugly (a facial deformity) don't even have the chance to make an impression.
[NAME] career ended after he broke his foot when he kicked a seat while blacked out on a party after a Vikings game.
I dislike the shade he‚Äôs been throwing to our franchise and his inability to take responsibility for the reasons why he was traded
DEGENERATES LIKE YOU BELONG ON A CROSS
Sooner or later you're both going to have to make some choices about your priorities.
You're a freak, you dirty dog you.
He was huge!
Hmm. Never saw a COMMENT downvoted!
You are my own side. I feel an affinity for this sub and want to make it a good experience for all.
It was when oil prices were higher. It‚Äôs primary export is petrol and the market slumping is hurting
This is lovely. Didn‚Äôt expect the end.
As a democrat, even I am afraid of a super majority. 
You solved the box, we came. Now you must come with us, taste our pleasures.
because people like before they watch a third of the video
I too cuddle with this guy‚Äôs sister in law if his wife is tired
I wanna pull a Squints from Sandlot if she‚Äôs around the pool, holy hell
Except that would retcon him trying to get her to have an abortion so still a mess
You seem eager to just eat up whatever Manila does, werk
If it‚Äôs a one hit kill like the regular crossbow, absolutely would be a fantastic crate weapon.
Wait there are still people on this subreddit who haven't blocked that account? I'm impressed.
This is the kind of thing that makes me want to low key record every single one of my lyft/uber rides.
It was a great AMA too
Actually I got mine right when they were getting banned
Nah. I just need to stop answering before I go to bed. Got the post and the replies mixed up in a sleepy haze.
I would of taken a shit in the woods real quick
That‚Äôs adorable! He probably wants them all in one spot so he can make sure they‚Äôre ok and not getting lost or hurt.
Imagine being an Iowa AND Northwestern basketball fan this year...
Ahaha, a Jersey driver calling other drivers awful... that's adorable.
What a turnaround.
Her and her wise friend [NAME]
Not seeing why that's depressing.
This is so cringey it hurts. I feel so bad for whoever sent this because they are so stupid.
How i wish i was there rn.
Man, such a shame we only got three movies. They really didn't wrap up all the plotlines.
I‚Äôm sticking by what I said.
Doesn't surprise me someone this uneducated would choose to inform the government they are evading taxes.
Yea, very rude. Avoid anything with a strong smell like fish and popcorn, curry is just as strong. 
This is why you either keep your distance or shoot them.
Lmao there is a reason they are one of the poorest and this is definitely a contributor..
Wow that is the exact armor combo i used to use
I‚Äôve never heard him say it but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he did. It‚Äôs believable enough
The lil dance he does after is amazing too
I mean, if I make it look like an accident, just think of all the ribs I can buy with the insurance money... 
If they lightbulb doesn‚Äôt change then it‚Äôs racist, sexist, Nazi scum. Am democrat just playing along. 
Oh shit right. I forgot about that wonderfully horrible fact haha.
Denver will pay for bus fare so homeless people can come live here And we love it! That's where the tents come from!
Nice! I missed the Babybel.
Why the assumption that Kitchens will turn out better than JBC did? The scenarios seem very similar
We‚Äôve done this twice, we have four awesome trees from them. Awesome organization!
He‚Äôs a great guy? Calm down lol
Lol...I was thinking the exact same thing.
I feel more attracted to boys. It's not a conscious choice.
I'm sorry but your username is absolutely horrible lol
Good news everyone!
I never thought to look for this subreddit! Thanks for sharing. I love this show
is there a wikihow for that? edit: [of fucking course there is]
Then wouldn't [NAME] have gotten sick too? As well as every other character who covered themselves in guts?
[NAME] mentions it in legends but it doesn‚Äôt really get addressed after that so much
That guy‚Äôs an asshole. He behavior doesn‚Äôt inherently have anything to do with poly.
Good luck dude!! Try to lower your expectations and everything will be more enjoyable .
Because they're having to compete and so we get exposed to the weakest of the bunch.
I think I love you. That pun took my broth away.
I like how adamant you are that you didnt woosh yourself
Yea but then he did the boop so it's fine
You're right, laws don't stop people from committing crimes, we might as well legalize murder. You people sound like retards.
Wow another person in Dunedin uses Reddit
Here you go. Just search your username for the respective platform.
i thought i was the only one who felt this way!
I thought this was a socialist Stossel-
But primarily, you think external factors are a bigger factor. It's true, after all. 
That‚Äôs rude af. Slay him with your words. Give him every insult in the book then say bye bye
Gotcha, thanks for the reply. I know about the emulator ones, just wasn‚Äôt sure if any had been ported
No,no wheel chairs, freedom alas.
Yea but that doesnt mean he hates them /s
> The frothing at the mouth over the Primary Arms charging handle What was this?
auto play really sucks but sex education was a really good show ngl I binged the whole thing in like two days.
It's seriously terrifying!
I killed. Last thing I want is to [NAME] don't trust [NAME] anymore, as he will always remember that he could have saved [NAME]
It's been over a decade since consoles decided to mandate wireless controllers and I'm still annoyed by it.
do your own homework
I guess it really can bring out the worst in people. Some of these groups seem outright predatory on young people who are angry at the world.
Seems full of himself, but he also seems like an ok dude.
[NAME] is the best
**You are breaking the car!**
Those all look like perfectly good cookies or is that the joke
Medical interventions that are undertaken to save the life of the mother, even if the result is the death of the fetus, are morally permissible. 
This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
Oh do the thing where you flick food into my mouth!!!
now you're getting it
that‚Äôs beautiful. are you sure it‚Äôs only twelve feet though? it seems much taller
The third was fun with the [NAME] & [NAME] banter, but my vote still goes to S1 for being mostly faithful.
Fierljeppen heck!
I hate Twitter
Omg deans you forgot to put your nagito relevance stamp
aha my favorite reply :)
Seriously, it would make me sad to stop caring about my kid because they had x number of birthdays. 
The API is completely down.
That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.
Low life is as low life does. I wouldn't be too surprised if he's broke by the time he's middle aged, unfortunately.
The last book feels like a dream. It's ridiculously bad, imo 
Baba Yaga has very defined taste.
No, that looks h*ckin delicious 
Lol I‚Äôm sorry that has to be terrible if we were up 19 just to get smothered at the end.
I foresee sharp objects bypassing the biometrics.
Wine with egg & FISH??? GROSS!!!
The beautiful moment when Fridays and Sundays are your set days off and you have the PTO to cover Saturday üëçüèª
> a new release is imminent. Hahahaha
If men were that aggressive we‚Äôd be arrested and then slammed publicly and socially. Lives ruined for a moment of drunken stupor.
Youre not wrong, but that applies to every ad. People are generally getting upset with the message more than anything though
Half the topics on this board are various factions insistent that the other factions are ruining this game.
How are you supposed to get any links in the first place if no site is trustworthy as you say?
thats terrifying. how can people do that to their own citizens?
Reminds me of Stampy
Exactly, I've seen some of her friends and family SM and is not exactly wowing me. 
During [NAME] and [NAME] cross examination, [NAME] never contested the finding of the key. Never accused them of planting anything. 
Sick of that stupid floss dance
Skyrim kinda aged poorly but I still keep coming back to it. Might start another playthrough soon.
It says I love to make myself laugh
You admit to discrimination based on your personal criteria. Say no more.
Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are.
She's a person of color, they instantly hate her lol. 
Me too, I just stood there clapping the whole time.
BUT THEYRE TIRED
I miss SFist's Apartment Sadness column.
Maaaan, that woman is crazy! And the straightjacket type!
Is it weird that I‚Äôm relieved?
I'm vegan and that's a big nope from me.
Getting outshot 12-5 but ending the period scoreless? I'll take it.
Every morning!
I care too much about what others think. Constantly trying to cater to their feelings or worrying about their opinions.
I would replace the standard size with the magnum XL just for shits and giggles. I bet they will message you back real quick or pick another replacement üòÜ
I will happily convert to [RELIGION] if I can quit my job and have unlimited food. Please tell me how to accomplish this
Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
It's an absurdly racist phrase that these anti-racist activists are very comfortable using for some reason.
Love to see pics like this.
BURN IT DOWN
Never ceases to boggle my mind how truly ignorant some people are.
What‚Äôs this ?the Olympics. Everyone is getting gold. Lol
Doesn't NY and NJ have reciprocity? Why did he have to take the NY bar at all?
To be fair mumble rap is shite
That guy at the start with the hat reminds me of [NAME]
Uhh don‚Äôt you mean [NAME] and [NAME]? They were so sweet together! /s
off [NAME] you lame ass I bet you smell like bellybutton lint.
Thank you for fading
I guess the top left forgot to read the part of history where their ideology failed many times, and killed many people
Short answer - No she's not okay. Yes I think she does.
I explained exactly why they‚Äôre authoritarian. Businesses are literal plutocracies.
Not sure why you got downvoted, it's easy to miss some of these brand replacement names
Source: /g/169743. He's saying this to [NAME] ~~(OWO)~~ if anyone's curious.
This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats, maybe ever
Always great to see a fellow [NAME] give proper advice
Why am I crying rn...
And what guns you like to use?
Imma let you finish, but Cutthroat Kitchen is one of the best cooking shows of all time.
Sir the fuck down. This is an intervention, we need to talk.
I agree.
There should not be enough nurses against vaccines to hold up the stupid sign.
"Love how there are no ""non-supporters"" commenting here. They have nothing to say. Nothing."
Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don‚Äôt let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
I‚Äôve found it quite useful up until the nuclear option.
I'm happy I live in a country where machete attacks don't have to be a real concern.
It more means nuxia needs help.
Someone tell me how to feel about this
Congratulations mate!!
Why would they stop there with like 15 feet of visibility? It clearly isn‚Äôt just the truck drivers fault
I literally never said it costs that much a day. It was just a dumb guess. It's obviously more, mate.
[NAME] was our only playmaker the past few years.
Go to rehab
Wooow! [NAME] hitting [NAME] with that question! Can‚Äôt wait to see that!
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that but can‚Äôt blame him. Thanks!
Dude alcohol is literally poison and talking about tryna self medicate?
Yes, that was indeed the joke, I‚Äôm glad you got it ;)
not my kid, not my problem. Best comeback ever xD
Glad to hear it's ubiquitous and not an OS thing.
Damn. [NAME]
Me when I distract the last zombie so my friends can work on the Easter egg without starting the next wave
"""one of us will be right!"" Or...ya both wrong and wasted your energy being dumb asses instead of enjoying it."
We understand! This is a very common reaction to our study. I appreciate you suggesting it :)
There must be some awful things happening right at this second
"Nevertheless, it amuses me that they mis-spelled ""literally"", and *only* ""literally""."
> edit: Sidenote they blatantly and obviously brigaded two other threads on this Of course they did.
Pfft why pay money when you can get similar negativity on reddit for free
I got the 4K Blu-Ray and the Mrs and I are convinced you see more than butt in that scene.
Didn‚Äôt locals cry bloody murder about that and get it rejected? I hope the state tell them to pound sand and do it anyway.
She's chill and is somewhat careful of her surroundings..
Sorry, realized I hadn‚Äôt answered the question lol. Was typing that when your response popped. 
it‚Äôs so weird to wear a blazer and khakis on a visit like that
That needs a standalone cooler to plug into just to operate effectively lol
[NAME] got heart
I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD
lol classic [NAME]
Munson‚Äôs Chocolate right here in my town of Bolton! Also Simoniz ... a major player in cleaning and protection products, right here in Bolton!
Is it because of the huge black spider above it?!? That bugs me more than it being off center...
You didn't deserve to win after drafting [NAME] in the 2nd
Ahhh, that was actually really peaceful and cathartic. 
You spent thousands of pounds on them? They sound kind of dickish to be honest. Find people who obviously value you for who you are.
Yes, when I need to get my jush, it‚Äôs freaking epic.
I think thats dumb and simplistic. You really can't boil down the sociology of race by comparing it to 2+2=4.
Told ya.
This makes me wonder if they fixed [NAME] having a very noticeable gap between her body and legs with her new shorts.
Hidilly ho there neighbourino now stop swearing you [NAME] damn cunt I'm buying my son GTA V
I‚Äôm really starting to like that kid
>I have always been fairly short (5'9) Is this supposed to be a joke.
There shouldn't be a rule against it. That just makes the target even softer.
Hi I‚Äôm [NAME], why don‚Äôt you take a seat over there.
Damn, I was really hoping for some comeuppance at the end, but at least you no longer have her for a boss, so silver lining.
Thank you! I appreciate the support
Nope. Sadly early 30s
Dear [NAME], It‚Äôs time for the next flood. Thanks.
Lmao seriously this is stupid. HEY GUYS DO YOU GUYS AS INTJS NEED TO DRINK WATER? NOT ME
Just the best WR in the league retweeting the best TE in the league, nothing to see here....
Always happy to help
lol, thank u. i might just not be the smartest, always possible
Getting outplayed by the Cavaliers LOL. Maybe [NAME] and [NAME] can take more bricks this quarter, seems to be working so far 
Just wanted to say that I'm also a 29 year old male and I'm in the exact same situation as you.
/uj I would've thought this was pics had it not been for your commie t
I appreciate the hell out of this.
"What to expect from a book author that has nfc that there is no ""3D"" in Unity's name."
"He may have, I was more worried about the ""running and shooting the AR one handed, off to the side""."
Legend has it the whole thing was filmed in a bath tub using rubber sharkies.
Oh goody, another idiot trying to tell other people what we believe. You are trolling, end of fact.
I'm still testing the waters. Hazelnut mocha latte with almond milk is da bomb!
This is petty af but I'm in
Both of you should!
when installing plants in your garden, make sure to check for compatibility with your current operating system ...
It doesn't though, and saying it's a reasonable solution to immigration is poppycock no matter how much you want it to be true.
Or is innocent but an enemy of [NAME]
Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
You cant pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
Ending a relationship with a toxic person is so freeing. Congratulations!
I love it. Enjoy your upvote.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Cheetos dust was coming out of his sweat.
i do not like the dollar store [NAME].
I agree. Could go either way.
They don't remember anything that happened before November 8th 2016. We are at war with orange man. We have always been at war with orange man.
I love how far some people stretch. I don‚Äôt think this fits the sub and now I‚Äôm a [NAME] that uses storefront. Nice.
The weed is garbage in comparison. I wouldn't get one of their dumb licensed just to sell crap.
Wow dan I like being up at 4am....
I wish the double down would leave *me* out of this! My poor stomach. Once was enough.
This is an excellently written response, thank you for offering her your support. 
It was never about comparisons, it was about our experiences and relationship to capitalists here.
Think I'm gonna get a chance radio, so I can talk to other car beds. 
Always felt like this match would go 5. Come on [NAME]!
Eh for the right money you cant go wrong letting the kid earn it
This sounds like a great idea! Stop STUPIDITY Act
This was taken when I posted it, I live in western Australia hills near Perth city, and Yeah Boy!!!
Yeah I‚Äôd love a before and after!
You have no idea how incredible they make me feel in every single way. It's not something I'm used to!!
Nice try..Hulu exec.
I hope you stay as warm and safe as you can ‚ùÑüíô
thanks this isn‚Äôt incredibly triggering for me (and a bunch of others) or anything
[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16
Thank you... I'll try but can't promise anything
Ah, I see you are a man of culture, as well.
Maybe I'm overly cautious, but when I was single I stayed away from people who worked with me. 
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** yosoyjackiejorpjomp! ^(hug)

You can get so much money from hunting. Fishing is probably the best method if you‚Äôre grinding but I actually enjoy hunting
I think he‚Äôs toast in 2020 with a solid candidate
Isn't that the point though? That's it's up to the people that aren't scientist to decide if the science has any meaning?
Minor league team names are often embarrassing...Biscuits, Rumble Ponies, Sand Gnats. Baby Cakes is particularly awful though, I‚Äôll grant you that.
Yea they seemed basically the same age while they were getting their scrogg on all over Lian Yu.
Am owned by a tiny beagle that was previously a stray. This is an underrated comment!
I use pinecones :)
And then another guy comments to congratulate him on getting a comment from her, wishing he could one day get the same. Maaan o man. 
You sound angry.
When Sub-Zero is revealed to have red accents, we will officially have a problem.
How about the hair... lovely. I'd rather die from a headshot...
You should come. You'd enjoy it.
Just say that you don't like it. It tastes of blood, tears, and death.
I'll take the Akot 3 but man that shot is ugly
mmm, yum... ALRIGHT GIMME 
So insightful!
Same with [NAME], she‚Äôs simply stunning at any age. 
He was cut yesterday, unfortunately
In addition to poor judgement, she is incapable of admitting she is wrong and apologizing. 
Opposing ethnonationalism and private property is hardly a weird hill for an anarchism to defend
The street drugs here are laced with fentanyl, i think I‚Äôll do something else
ya lol i‚Äôm not here to depress myself more than i already am

Please pass this. We will finally get the same thing we have in California before scotus.
That's why you stand holding your card in one hand and tapping it on the other, to make it obvious you're impatiently waiting

Oh boy somehow this got political remember every ONE, HOLY, APOSTOLIC, AND UNIVERSAL
Ah TDS victim, got it.
Wow,29 turnovers. Something to talk about
This sounds encouraging. I hope they get lots of support from the public.
Through mutual friends, and online forums. I find out most online shooters are more fun when playing in a party and able to chat.
This really is matter of principle. Its small now and it would only encourave him to take more next time.
I love hunting/fishing. I‚Äôm on every day, too. Add me: [NAME]
That I was unbreakable. It took some serious injuries in ‚Äúhigh school‚Äù until I realized that I wasn‚Äôt.
This is pretty funny. I‚Äôve known dozens of people who fall into all of those stereotypes.
I don't know where exactly but these pictures are really good. Keep it up!
You know what‚Äôs a real tragedy? I‚Äôm yet to find Soleil art with brand.
Then I disagree that being a cog in someone‚Äôs machine is reason to be resentful.
thanks for the thoughtful reply. but yeah I guess its mostly a pipe dream! I wish someone would post some detailed ideas and replies like this!
Yep, unprepared for first period, forgot my pants while wandering around the school, etc. Been teaching 5 years and I still get these dreams
You‚Äôre right, my bad
Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?
I used to know a woman who got a lot of freelance work out of okcupid. Never done it myself though.
"[NAME] "" haters gonna hate"" the most cringe I've seen of any politician. Worse than [NAME] benefit singing some working class song. "
I really hope that this guy becomes the next u/back2worksoon on Meme Monday
Wow! It's dead af here
Nah she's just a dull asari doctor, with a pleasing voice.
Can you imagine the amount of backlash she‚Äôd get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg.
At least you went out with a bang.
Cool have fun
B plug? What the hell. Use an A plug or you're never going to become doctor some day.
I do not, sorry! I am not talented in the ways of making/editing videos.
Wait isn't that the [NAME] from Fiver?
Because it was a cool video it was sweet, and because it was a fash it was bitter. Simple as that.
"I don't think you're ""wrong"" for doing it, but I think you're frustrating yourself arguing with someone who won't be swayed."
Lol yeah. It‚Äôs cute that he said it but didn‚Äôt realise it could have a double meaning.

Where did he ever want to nuke women's rights? Could you provide me with a source
what would be the point of that I already told you I was dumb my little vagina looking friend
Can't tell if sarcasm, or an irrelevant statement, but thanks, first thing to see venturing into reddit at 00:15, actually nice :o
Reading on that sub makes me sick.
And they‚Äôre a marine biologist...
Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
They really dislike each other.
You can't just ignore [NAME]' cup wins though.
It's the same couple of people. The only thing I really dislike about this subreddit is that it swings to the left too hard sometimes.
San Junipero. What if old ladies could fuck, using the Matrix!?
Happy new year to you too! :>
Butter bronzer-physicians formula and I HATE the smell. I haven‚Äôt really played w it but wow, so scented.
Wait, isn't everyone nervous or scared the first time they hold a newborn? 
KUBIAK WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US???
What a hilarious joke... Comedy has basically become bashing.
It's not internalized homophobia, it's literally just an annoying voice.
I already did
Good lad!
I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link
I believe if under 6 months you'll get it all back in the end.
Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn‚Äôt get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
This is disgusting.
I wish that too üò¢
My favourite pool! Shame I don't live around there anymore
Congrats on your commission, do your best!
I actually really liked that you added in your personal interests. I like Korean boy bands too.
The dude even looks like [NAME]!
[NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] podcast is great.
I hope you aren‚Äôt saying that there is no co-relation between imperialism/colonialism and standards of living in the West, in this case Britain.
My icebreaker is you do all the work.
Old news in Canada.
I haven't seen safes but I have seen arks with a lock and key setup.

I love bloodborne, I started my second play through but quit after I got busy with school stuff.. need to go back to it though.. love that game 
Have faith.
It's shameful that he has to preface this post with his bias. Couldn't just leave well enough alone.
My sister put her foot into the muddy end of a pond once and thought she was dying. We had to go home. It was hilarious.
I don't like it, simply because men never want to be just friends, and I have no interest in dating random dudes who message me.
under inflated tires can cause tire fires, as per the DoT handbook and fmcsa
And yet you're still not making me regret being a TV hodad when that was on and so missing it.
That PP also had a much better first unit than this team has.
This. This is too realistic man. Too late for this too.
Look on the bright side, you might never need to worry about that ever again.
I remember saying [NAME] messed up the timeline worse than [NAME] over a year ago
I came here to say this.
This is a good point, thanks :)
are you short ? maybe your toilet is too tall causing the seat to cut circulation
You are absolutely stunning and you‚Äôre a triple threat. Black is beautiful! And you‚Äôre intelligent and very pretty.
I‚Äôve gone through it before, and it sucks. I‚Äôm still a little hazy and withdrawn.
Gotta preach the truth!
She sends it to her tinder dates as proof of identity. Edit: maybe grinderdates or something else. I don't want to descriminate against ANY sex-dating app.
I do take Vitamin C, daily. I purchased some probiotics yesterday. Hope those will help. 
Lol. That's exactly what I said. Yep. That's it.
Ugh obviously that's not what I meant, what I meant is that *socially* if they have a sibling that they do not need humans *socially*. 
How dare you disparage a 3D printed JV riding a goddamn raptor
Thank you much better now
Confused and triggered
Right? It looked wild AF for a baby shower lol
death of fear is certain.
Get out more. Make more friends and better friends. Don‚Äôt self-harm. Write my journal more often.
That‚Äôs sick!
[NAME] I want to get that ~~monkey~~blackhawk off our back so bad.
surprised he hasn‚Äôt mentioned [NAME] after saying [NAME] the best manager/coach he‚Äôs ever worked with
Ok that makes sense. Im familiar with the term.dog whistling, just havent seen ot attached to globalists.
[NAME] bless [NAME]!
Bitch yes!
I deserved it. I'm a garbage cumslut. He owned me and he took his property.
Samsies! I could have written the feels in this post. It's like the job I never ever wanted and got and now I've tenure
It is like how I imagine [NAME] and [NAME] people seeing wooden ships across the water the first time.
The best role you can take to climb is shot caller. Give your team the information they're not aware of and they'll be more useful.
Oooo, shiny! (Is the blue one the new one?)
Aight thanks bro for the insight
I perform nostril waxing. It is surprising hardly painful at all. Feels so much better too!
Can't make negative comments about her on here dude. Downvotes incoming
But what if he feels like his position is appealing to those the [NAME] have left behind?
He just texted me that he misses me...
#OMG TERRIFYING!!!!
You mean...I **don't** have to be #blessed and #thankful that I am moving to another country at the end of this month?
Yeah. Agreed there. Thought you didn't know what exactly this was :p
Sorry mate, you‚Äôve got the wrong sub. This is for **bad** UK.
No problem! Happy to help :)
*wrap* happy birthday
Looks like pure tabbaco but great roll !
This person should be outed to the world. What a reckless pos
Goth pale is lovely.
That [NAME] block on the [NAME] TD was awesome. He sealed the left side with authority.
Didn't even think of that ><
Well AB definitely isn't the norm, but if you're gonna have burgers and fries why not have something better
Leave me alone [NAME] and go take care of your man. [NAME] great for you, be happy. 
Unfortunately, the DM is [NAME].
The chicken and bacon one sounds absolutely baller. I‚Äôll have to check it out! Thanks
Ew her text is touching her photo, what a slut
Considering that the picture OP jerked was fake and that the OP of the faked picture was rude as fuck to absolutely EVERYONE, that‚Äôs completely false. 
I upvoted this comment because I'm a dumbass snarkball who doesn't know how anything works.
That makes sense.
Hasn't he also lied about his height previously?
Fascism = National Socialism Which is another reason why both Nationalism and Socialism are bad. [NAME] use some of their ideas!!!!!
No. I make jokes about it, and so does he but he doesn't actually know. 
Beautiful part of the world. Heading back up in a few weeks once the snow finally settled!
shitposts are hazardous to your health.
Nope they never did and they broke up really early on in s1 like the first episode literally
Is that her official name now? [NAME]
This guy probably just started watching football. These younger generations just aren't as educated as they used to be.
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE TALKIN‚Äô TO ME!
Thought so. Thanks!
Have faith, I'm sure there is enough fan support for more popular characters to be brought back. 
Thanks for sharing, we have a new thread for today
Im looking for this, but I predict a 3-1 win to bar√ßa. I really hope [NAME] doesnt bore me
I'm so proud of this community
Wow yeah similar to my story what a nightmare :(
I‚Äôm curious about the chain of life events and choices that could land someone at this point in life
Yeah it‚Äôs weird bc in my family the basket case was my dad.
Maybe its the picture but the fabric looks really bad
It's not an official licensed promotional company yet, thats why his next fight is under the mayweather promotion banner and his future fights could be as well. 
Omg sorry I just laughed out loud and also died inside for you.
Yeah, but I just don't want to pay for a full blown wedding, those can get expensive.
That‚Äôs a pretty great play mate. I applaud you.
You can read the report she was pretty busted up. You can restrain a woman without leaving her bruised up.
I think not including a question about favorability of [NAME] was a missed opportunity, given the questions are clearly written by someone involved in the rationalist community.
Nothing about that looks comfortable
This is not porn lol
WHO DAT!
Living up to his last name.
I'd rather just let them fester over there and deal with them when they hatch from their spores
This march is spreading complete lies then as there are no rights a man has that a women doesn‚Äôt.
i really hope this is old and ironic
Love the guy complaining the panel is stacked against the rich what with all the high tax rhetoric. *The WORLD is stacked against the rest of us.*
I'm loving the blocked shots from rust, what a stud 
... that's... Literally what they did... The fixed the bug, and balanced abathur accordingly. What else do you want?
I watched the whole thing. I miss that style of cartoon. Simultaneously silly and understated.
They love me!
Write her a hand written letter and go back and deliver that to her damned door.
as someone who dealt with a burn out/mental break down 4 years ago, /s/ this post makes me feel very optimistic about the future /s/
U can still pour it out the lock holes. Hook it up
Get your mom professional help. Any grow person who runs away from their own home afterargument definitely has mental health issues
Where are all the memes about tops ending up with another top? Cause trust me, it sucks just as much, if not more. 
he looks pretty average to me. like many guys i've seen on the train.
Poor horse, must have hurt a lot.
That and i realized that i have many lucid dreams where i know that i am dreaming. I never had lucid dreams before nofap
What do you stop from trying until seeing if you truly can or not?
really? I tried last NYE during the day and it was dead
[NAME] stands a solid chance honestly
Haha hopefully, that'd be good for his morale. I just wanna beat the Knicks tonight honestly. 
Don't remember the gold but I wanna say like $16ish and like 430 exp
Maybe hes changed i did when she left?
You're not kidding about the savage energy part. Just look at this man.
Deer needs to make a false injury claim and get paid did you see that fake I got hit jump it did?
That's just sad and depressing. Was the race closing before she finished? Well, at least she did it.
Thanks. I appreciate your advice. It is what I was looking for. Thanks again.
He's always had the tools to do this, which is why he can be frustrating at times.
Mate, you're proving my point.
wow that's next level here. I am familiar with people dangerously going over 2+ lanes and the zebras but I have never seen that in DFW.
Open borders, free healthcare, free college, no taxes or guns. Did I miss any of the dream? Oh yes, regulated speech too. 
I don't wear panties. You'll need to describe the sensation.
Not paranoid , just cautious I do the same thing buddy I'm not going to leave it up to chance 
Yay! Mine‚Äôs Cymbalta and Lamictal with a dash of Ativan lol
There could have been men going that we‚Äôre not priesthood holders.
I like the earthquake that occurs after she falls. Glad the cameraman got that on video.
I love it when people have a background in STEM and the arts and manage to pursue both!
I tried to but i ended up booing the postman
Note to self: always remember to draw my eyebrows on before posting a selfie.
We knew *a* person was within eyesight, which doesn't exactly give us much. 
Das pretty sweet. No-look throw!
Great story. Maybe it isn't malicious compliance, but I enjoyed it anyway. Damn companies who lack empathy for other humans.
Google gold's formula. It's what NRcan recommends. Few whitepapers will come up as well, if more in-depth research is your thing.
"No, the root Arabic word is ""hashishiyyin"", with it's Latin translation being ""assassinus"". Assassin is the French translation. "
M/21/straight/6‚Äô2 Back on tinder after taking a year off dating to focus on personal stuff. Go ahead and judge! Thank you in
i like the poster
If you would do exactly as that kid did - then you will never get it. You‚Äôre defending a smug little asshole.
Never would have thought about that
We‚Äôre all bible on this blessed day
If you are not going to kick him out, then don't complain. It is all your choice
That first fall was clearly the universe trying to save her from losing her face.
Way to go mama for being so supportive!
My thoughts EXACTLY [NAME] looks dead.
I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
I just want to point at that yes, fuck [NAME], yes he's subhuman, but that tattoo is not of [NAME]. lol
I remembered it slightly differently. My brain is terrible for coming up with this one: [NAME] Long Thick Penis Has Come To Town.
Keep doing this with your meals until you have some part of your dish that was originally cooked a few months ago
[NAME] needs to settle down before [NAME] gets him all worked up.
Do I even wanna know what that means?
Lol I wish
Must have been no phones around during slavery
She‚Äôs all natural
This guy - you win.
You‚Äôre a good man. Stay blessed
I‚Äôm sorry he‚Äôs treating people this way. You will find even greater and less costly bliss!
It does change based on choices. Apparent ones are [NAME] or [NAME] being captured. Other little things might change as well.
My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
Except [NAME] had his brains blown out by a .50 cal bullet at point blank range.
"""therapy>no therapy"" very debatable, my friend."
YOU DIED
Wrong, that‚Äôs where we hide the funkos
‚ÄúWhy are you complaining, every team would‚Äôve signed this guy‚Äù
Sorry. Was hard to understand for me as well.
Would breaking her jaw and hands be out of line? She couldn‚Äôt call or text, what a shame. 
You can do that here dude. got a story? just tell it man
Then later, when you're using alcohol to drown your sorrows, at least the guy in the mirror is a friend that you can drink with.
I don't see anywhere in her post where she says that.
[NAME] will end up owning all these untouchable records and I hope they don‚Äôt get broken for generations
I may be mistaken but I believe it‚Äôs illegal to fly over the north and south poles for any aviator
I was hoping they‚Äôd put people behind him and let [NAME] pass to them super hard
Same with the seated calf machine always leave a plate on.
I wish I could see [NAME] slipping on shrimp
BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK his ass!
I wish Florida was a thing for me... But I'm keeping toasty with a little liquor love in Erie, PA... 
NBA is like Westworld only completely opposite. Every time you act like your true self you get a T lol
Happy Birthday!!!
[NAME] doesn't get a vote [NAME]! Get the fuck out of here with this nonsense.
It‚Äôs such a horrible argument I‚Äôm shocked they still use it.
This comment is very good and all but it got me thinking, *are* pizzas a type of tire?
Happy new year /r/newyorkmets. Everyone in this community makes this place feel seriously special. Let's go win a world series in 2019.
If he doesn‚Äôt give it a ten I‚Äôm gonna riot
Oh thanks a lot! :) Please let me know.
Right now I live in a medium sized one but I have lived in a big city for a couple of years.
Busy night for you lol
Emotional roller coaster
Good luck!
Yep. Tough week for [NAME]. Not shooting well, first ejection and fine, ripping out jerseys, first triple double and the DSJ drama. 
I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down
Where‚Äôs the joke? I can‚Äôt even figure out why someone would laugh at this.
Yeah I had a lot of respect for him in that moment.
Edibles!!
Oof. Same guy probably would've had an aneurysm if he saw how much my boss charges for a cup of shredded cheese
For real though, TurboGraphix16 was pretty cool. They had some neat games.
I'm so sorry but just do everything you can for you and daughter and of course mom.
No, my point is that looking to past behaviors isn‚Äôt indicative of what is right and virtuous 
Have nobody thought of the giant tech corporation selling overpriced, inferior products to sheep customers? That's odd.
It looks like you might have some sand in your angina.
[NAME] damn it, I knew something was wrong, oh well.
I wanted to romance [NAME] more than I've wanted to romance more than any other character in the series. Such an awesome dude
I agree üòä
except for call your mother. The undisputed best bagels in dc.
I like it! It kinda feels like new territory, almost more real than old reality shows. It‚Äôs funnier and lighter too
I used to fantasize about my morning oatmeal. One packet of instant oatmeal. [NAME] dreamed about it.
im just going to leave this here
The truth is, there is no spoon.
This is great
Thanks. I want to travel the world but have no reasonable way of affording it.
Really appreciate this post and article. I just subscribed and between this and the sidebar I'm feeling pumped about starting he learning.
What else did you expect?
With just coffee and nothing fancy I did love the Komodo blend back in the day.
Haha didn‚Äôt even notice. It‚Äôs staying.
Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh. 
Interesting, I know another millionaire who takes to Twitter and rambles in an attempt to distract people from negative news about him... 
>just because I miss [NAME] and [NAME], who played them. You forgot to add the rest of that sentence 
I kept them and wish I hadn't. A pain to get rid of the further removed you are.
Kleber 1 on 3 doesn‚Äôt matter lol
It's been 10 minutes, I'm still laughing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Pay this man
Funny they put her between [NAME] and [NAME] as well.
The ones that actually think he's worse than [NAME] also thinki its ok to raise their kids genderless.
#I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN.
>Dumb, but wonderful. That's my kind of a pet. Silly,soft and adorable. 
**GOD DAMN YOU, FIGHT BACK!!**
that scared me
"You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
As much as I would love this kind of support, I had beef with people over EVERYTHING
When I'm the fifth Hokage I'm gonna make sure no one has to go through that sort of abuse! Believe it!!
You know we can see your post history, right? Orange fan sad.
Was he really [NAME] though? Even if he wasn't made up by the early church I doubt it.
You sir are a true hero.
True....I know! I can only get them at the fair....not even BBQ restaurants have them in my town.
**Lost** children. Issues we face today are likely fabricated from the bottom up.
"If by ""better"", you mean ""more fun"", then I'd go with the second one. <smile>"
No, it's hard to come by!
Understood - PM was all gears and no downtime. Last thing I would want is another bloody job like that. Cheers
I like it. Ending made me cry happy tears. I don't cry often
This is a very cool option!
I appreciate that there's correct number of YES in there. It's so rare.
Its whatever you make of it. No one can tell you what it feels like except you, this is a journey you‚Äôll have to take alone
He‚Äôs one gorgeous and clever little man! Congrats on the new baby too!!!!
"You know it doesn't use the word ""boycott"" at all, right?"
I think [NAME] has unlocked [NAME]
[NAME] sees all
Right outside of 723, formerly quad studios. 2pac was shot in the elevator of that studio. 
This gets posted a lot. It‚Äôs not really that great. Interesting concept - the first hour had my interest - goes downhill the second half.
I'm stigmatized against the pretty large group of 20 somethings I have interacted with who make gaming their whole identity. At least no-one calls themselves netflixer
Washington Justice!
I don't live there just have family there.
Overwatch. Dota 2. Rocket League. There are plenty of games that implement loot boxes well, and are the better for it. 
The food clapped
correct, even if it's EX and has invincibility then your parry will win.
lol this is good.
This is actually fascinating. I actually love this. Please don't call the cops.
check your DM
Option B for sure. But with more roundabouts plz.
>I *am* fascinated that some people call themselves incels while acknowledging that they aren't virgins. oh, then you should check out femcels.
Guess you don‚Äôt understand that the Citizens United vs FEC ruling came around 26 years after [NAME] was president.
Why did no one check [NAME] for her comments though?
"""Out of all the people that lost, you came first in that group. You're the biggest loser"""
Chicago has had mostly mild winters lately, so when it gets really cold or snowy lately we complain more. 
Most vancouverites know of these scams. Especially #1 broken credit card machine. Complaints go unheard.
Also a tacklebox is what you keep fishing gear in. Not sure if the football thing was a reference to that.
But [NAME], if they invited you there'd be no storyline!!
"I read ""Driscoll"" as as ""Discoroll"" and assumed this was in NC."
I have had a gf for a long time but still FA (no friends)
OP and wife probably have other areas that are private. Sometimes it could be our dreams that even we don't dare speak aloud to ourselves.
That's sad. I'm 16 and where I am there are loads of athiests my age. It's great.
I had smoothies in the past with these packets. Solid as fuck. Dragonfruit one too.
"Innovation means ""I pridefully made this"" in China."
Their sounds of silence cover is very good
This helped me put together some of my thoughts after watching last night, especially how vanilla and ineffective [NAME] looked. Thanks for taking the time to write this out
This is why I love baseball
Lol. That too
I guess I can see that, especially cuz [NAME] has connections with TMZ and they love drama between two people
OK, thanks.
Lol, I don't know the game that well
You do you, man. 
I'm sorry. On the plus side, your toilet joke made me laugh really hard. Lol. Thanks
Best not let [NAME] near him, what with her oils and all...
I miss [NAME] butt.
You'll be fine.
I‚Äôm in one of those schools now got offered weed yesterday almost bullied into smoking
Good bot lol
This is terrible
My name is [NAME] too. It's so strange hearing my favorite bravolebs say it on TV.
Bro we got destroyed last time, we‚Äôre due for a heartbreaking missed field goal or extremely ill-timed turnover 
To me, the best smell a person can have is just a clean smell. 
SOMEONE GETS IT
It is if you're a loose spool.
Much love half purple homie
When they tell me ‚Äúoh my [NAME] you don‚Äôt look 22, you look 15‚Äù 
Well I'm glad the whole coffee vs beer exchange was the most accurate part of the episode. When it comes to accents, anyway...
SF makes a little more but it evens out with Seattle once you figure in CA state income tax and SF cost of living. #savedyouaclick
Thanks, this means a lot! I will do don't worry :)
It was nice knowing you all.
I'm still happy about it and will be for the entire offseason.....if not longer :)
[NAME] voice acting in this is just brilliant.
This is the reason why I don't have friends. Not even skinny ones, you never know how they will be in the furure
dude, your mom is a fuck-nugget, i‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this 
you are so welcome. I‚Äôm glad I could bring sunshine to your day.
Good for you.
Dude, it‚Äôs turn of phrase. 
I suppose the circumstances of it would chance things a bit :p
I've never been so proud of humanity.
sure but that doesn't change the fact that he's probably not a neccbeard
The shocking conclusion.
That sounds very sketchy to me. I would be thinking he‚Äôs with another girl TBH
For me it's how much I love canned black beans that take a minute and forty five seconds in the microwave lol.
She threw it in the trash? Pig! Wash it down the sink, even if it's a pancake.
"""I shot [NAME] in the face"""
Duh, but it should also make it understandable why many people don‚Äôt. 
I have. Here, its implying he wants to fuck the dog. The original the dog is just scared of him.
> i find it very dog-like and adorable :) I find it very monster-like and terrifying :|
"Here's another message ""You're a good mom. Your boy is lucky to have you."""
I don‚Äôt think you even know what you are talking about yourself
I‚Äôm thinking yes and this was done on purpose.
wow. how arrogant of him /s
Just be supportive and listen. Maybe do something that would make her happy like a favorite chocolate
I like it
The moment that bird touches my xbox, it'll become a mcnugget. 
You're talking about something complete different there.
*Succession* was fantastic. *Barry* too
Juve somehow still managed to get the upper hand in the [NAME] for [NAME] and [NAME] deal. That's some voodoo shit right there.
If your host stand has a register that isn‚Äôt locked securely you have bigger problems than this lady I think
Why so much green though lol
Since I was a kid I knew I preferred funny, smart, interesting girls to conventionally attractive ones. Really tore me up the feeling wasn't mutual.
There's syrup AND raw sugar on it, smh why. 
I know [NAME]. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
Love when this happens. Thank you, oh wise one.
link to the crack tweet?
for me it was def the egg yolk. i‚Äôm pouting as i reluctantly eat it.
I love [NAME] can‚Äôt wait for the full circle version of him
My inevitable famine is when I run out of pop tarts and get sad
Quit being racist. They're just being racists.
Wait, I'm confused now. A brain can only handle so much.
>a water molecule spends around 600 years in Lake Superior. I guess it takes a while lol
Can‚Äôt get hep or HIV from shitty politics.
I love miramar
You can't choose whether you like pork better than chicken but you can choose whether you have pork or chicken for supper.
But platonic cuddling is comfy (after making sure the consent stuff is a ok for all parties)
Do all you can. Really everything is put in perspective, my work seems very unimportant right now. 
You‚Äôre a joke
This was a year where late breakers broke towards [NAME]. Whereas late breakers broke towards [NAME] in 2016. That explains how she did so well.
"And lo, for he took to Facebook and quoth righteousness, and the people were joyful, and gave unto him many ""likes."""
You're fighting the good fight here. If you still want blackberries on your property, you can always try growing our native one, *Rubus ursinus*.
"Something something ""low information voters"" or whatever other euphemisms the bro-iest bros use for anyone not like them."
Thanks so much for the advice! Will definitely keep that in mind
I love this sub. You are my people. ;)
I'm excited!
You sure showed him buddy.
Thanks I hate it.
In looking at the questions answered in the AMAs following the [NAME] podcast, I don't see any related to [NAME] or race/IQ. 
Ah man, so many memories of those skits
Omg i hope this is about [NAME]. I would LOVE to see [NAME] and [NAME] go head to head
HIT OR MISS
visit your school's career center and speak to a career counselor. he/she can help you with referrals. good luck!
"""They didn't get [NAME]. They got [NAME]."" - [NAME] on draft night That boy gud!"
That‚Äôs a catch all term not a breed, but yeah it includes spaniels like this one 
Great info. Thx
Never listen to songs with someone you love. Just don't. Trust me.
That was just embarrassing. We should not be loosing here.
If the blindness ever comes back for whatever reason, try doing this:
That's awesome. I would never have expected the Prius community to be so involved.
Hands down one of my favourite VA's and a main reason I go FemShep or play games she's in.
[NAME] from Benoni is doing well for herself ...
Interesting. I wonder how does this work. Does it do swaps itself? Does it utilize the currency exchange listings? I'll check it out later.
The polls don't reflect that. He's more popular than ever
Yeah [NAME] is actually really cute and nice but best boi and best girl goes to [NAME] and [NAME]. Just kidding. [NAME] all the way
Best of luck to you my friend, keep going 
allegedly it from when he was underage. So maybe let's not do that.
I do the 4-second gap as well and is it infuriating to see someone take advantage of it.
I totally have second-hand embarrassment for my parents. It's equally bad when they misspell something in their email address (i.e: posion instead of poison) üôÑ
Yes, we are going to kink shame you. 
There isn't. It only exists in the heads of those who subscribe to these tinfoil theories.
Who was the molester in the family cause the way you worded it confused me
That‚Äôs a straight up ghoul
She ain't a prostitute. She just likes giving head.
[NAME] poisoned them both
Cool. Glad I'm not the only one who found it weird.
Well the explosive oil laced diarrhoea probably makes you feel better about the flu
Enjoying it. It makes shaving my head easier.
Is [NAME] up to his neck is dodgy dealings again after RHI?
[NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing.
The last time Russian military contractors met US forces, they lost 200 men and dozens of armored vehicles. Lmao.
Nope. What‚Äôs it about?
The pic is Mehenjo-daro?
Rough comment to read but glad I did. Thanks for the write up.
Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
Definitely don‚Äôt rush. That‚Äôs how unfortunate decisions happen, and then you‚Äôre linked to that person for the rest of your life.
5 Chelsea players, hits Arsenal player
Whoever wrote this article has no concept of what‚Äôs going on what so ever. There assessments are miles off the mark.
> and [NAME] mentions that he's cold to the touch. you mean after he almost froze to dealth?
Stay hydrated, move slowly and stay cool.
omg you got me, what do i do now, pls help
Oh man.
Like a record baby!
"Bloody forking shirtballs! This has to be some kind of ""The Good Place"" / Bad Place repost robomod bullshort. "
That would be sick!
It's gorgeous
This makes me very happy, thank you for sharing!
Why didn‚Äôt she celebrate, she redirected that one in!!
There is only one metal that should be sliding down their throats. Ka-chunk!
Kinda is. But whatever. Complaining on reddit works too. Except it doesn‚Äôt.
I guess you were hoping for love from someone who is not well enough to offer love.
Yes! I binged it (I was a late adopter) and then all of a sudden nothing!
Funny how artificial famines are genocide when the Brits do it, but not when it's the Soviets. 
delusional about dread being a scam (don't know how this would work) and more of these conspiracy theories with zero proof/
Yeah, I actually like the combination of the two styles of names thought. Love the LAFC and the LA Galaxy...lol
Welcome to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, where families can be SEPARATED forever
taj with 12 and 5 before the half, great game so far. Hopefully [NAME] can continue his 1st quarter shooting
I lost it when all the heroes kept going back and forth into siege range
say it with me now super star
Damn, savage but true.
- There is no such thing as moral capitalism - Seizing the means of production is a communist thing, not a socialist thing. 
so basically, there‚Äôs a rumor that there‚Äôs a rumor that [NAME] trilogy might take place after the ST?
My god she is desperate for a do-over baby. What a shrew.
Utter nonsense from yourself.
Lmfao i don't know why this is so funny
My body is ready for our Tank Commanders return!
Vancouver is such a beautiful city! I visited it for a half a day and really want to go back.
Wow, this is my trashy goals in life. This woman is living out my dreams.
Oh [NAME] it's happening again!
Except [RELIGION].
Top-10 money?
They will be once enough young progressives have replaced the older centrists :) Welcome to the new Democratic Party!
More worried about the multi-trillion dollars in entitlement programs than 5$ on a wall.
You better have done 3oh!3 proud and twisted
Great now my child is crying
I kiss the shade all dude. His username was trewdat. I miss that guy.
I think people are more worried if he'll stay or not than whether he plays at the same level or not.
"I dont know much russian, but all I heard was ""Oohhh fuck. Shit."" (Rocket launches and explodes) ""......shit."""
This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.
I love the arm blasts on the ice. That dude was determined and loves his dog. Very cool.
He had been so worried that the stepmom would have a hard time integrating into the family.
like a [NAME] of them
Was feeling victimized that it was very cold in my apartment. Windows are drafty af!!!!
Damn dude, can‚Äôt believe I never considered this possibility.
Then spend already! Go get [NAME] and [NAME] and [NAME]. Bring up that young talent and dominate already.
Better love big ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù hearts!
Yeah it wasnt like we had girlfriends
Or had the plan for a while and put 25 bucks away each cheque for a bit for this plan.
"Yes, and when I do say ""no"" I'm filled with tremendous guilt. "
Yours is the most interesting and thought provoking comment yet.
"It does say as well that average waist size increased 2.6"" in 21 years "
Idk, I couldn't imagine getting a bag of detergent and mistaking it for heroin
You die > mom will be sad
....be the autism. Totally different
He could run for President of the US and WIN!
Never let a fact get in the way of a bad argument apparently.
A thousand times this! I just found some of my old childhood stuff from the 80s with a 2 bar and it is fucking awesome.
This is why we love Football!!!
Right. He didn't even say a word. I feel like I've seen this before tho.
I see BOTW and now I'm waiting for a group of grown men to watch shitty old movies.
We're a community, like it or not. This came from us and we need to hold eachother to a higher standard of behavior.
Death will come in the end. Live while you can. Life is a once in an eternity opportunity.
The face in the bottom photo is perfect!
Agree on the last point. My INTP friend's ENFP is immature since she's still young. Gets jealous at every damn girl that approaches... Sigh
It's too bad that you think helping out the less fortunate is sad and make a joke about it . People like you are the problem.
I understand that there are issues. However, if someone chose to stay away from Perth due to the violent behaviour then where would they go on holiday?
She's a bloody sociopath.
Modern buildings are horrible.. I‚Äôve felt like this before. Stars and birds still fill me with a sense of wonder most often.
That‚Äôs because she is. Honestly she‚Äôs done like a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô performance once and the rest high. Others are unfortunately her eliminaysh-ions
I feel like I lost focus... I have not accomplished anything and the clock isn't really stopping
> but to say that it will fuck up your mind is simply ignorant lolol k.
I know a partner of mine wanted to convert so we could get married. But he's an atheist so IDK how he expected that to happen
Lord help me I want to be a mod again. So many damn trolls here
Very interesting study.
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you‚Äôre still wrong....
Oh, Boy. You into phrenology too.
That's true, you'd imagine it'd have come up beforehand. 
If you look really, really closely you will find the man tears in his eyes...
well that‚Äôs what you get for your bigoted speech
Pretty sure you could do that with a cargo ship too, so I'm not sure I buy that argument.
Cat puke. After a chocolate sundae. Idk. Looks horrid
No now a days they‚Äôre regularly updated to reflect the current stats and rosters. This commercial would have been great for The Show 17.
What a run by the [NAME]! And by far my favourite jerseys of this tournament.
They spam that stuff because its working. Make them stop it .. and punish them.
Reality: someone sees a pet outside and thinks it doesn't have a home, so they adopt it.
Calm down [NAME].
Then you‚Äôre opposed to the running game. His [NAME] largely suffered because [NAME] got the juicy carries.
[NAME], [NAME] 4 u..... enjoy
Last event went well, 40+ signups. Looking forward to some new faces this time. Special surprise for the winner!
oh, carry on then
It also would have to take less than like 2 hours for me to get to my destination, time is worth more to me than real money ya know
Yeah. Hard not to catch feelings sometimes, even if they are just a bunch of writeoffs.
Yeah I'm in the same boat regarding DC, its hard to imagine living in many other places in the country for me at this point.
[NAME], Big Bang Theory is terrible so glad it's going to be gone.
Ketamine is absolutely bizarre in high doses. I lack the words to really describe it. I've never felt so detatched from my own humanity.
Let‚Äôs go! TRoss is awesome
im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child.
Ooh, I wanna be [NAME]!
Yeah that's where my eyebrow went up. The liability issues alone would make it a non-starter.
what an idiot
It is hard to make up the new relevant points at times.... Revolution they say
I don't get your point. I love the grind as well, that's why I tried to get dark matter and prestige master. 
[NAME] damn it curtis
Yes, listening to loud noises can damage your ears. Temporarily and permanently.
A lot of girls who are hot don't want to date someone who can be more attractive than they are.
Oh shit, yeah that's definitely shady.
Fucking hate [NAME]..
Never worked on my babies. So disappointing
Seems like a much ado about nothing.
I love how people complain about too many midfielders yet still want [NAME].
Did you get to try the bipod? I can't wait till I get home.
[NAME] looked bad pre release. Post release she was touched up and tweaked. Relax.
Don't just distance yourself, BLOCK them
She's ugly so that might add some more months.
Please explain how I‚Äôm genuinely curious
[NAME] had more of a Pro Bowl season than [NAME].
Hopefully that's patched soon.
I hate this arm swing thing. Either try to sync up or just stop doing it.
It was a very nice car, a 1978 Bugatti.
Society hates everything. Just love yourself and the rest becomes easier.

[NAME]. I love how this question soundly crushes that entire paragraph, and the only response is a downvote.
[NAME] death is just so..... senseless. Why? WHY??? The based gods have forsaken us
You clearly don't have a clue about [NAME] career so don't start worrying about it now.
>fabricated moral high ground The irony of saying that as everyone here jerk's themselves off to a meme
It's irrelevant because that's not how we elect presidents. He won an electoral landslide. He flipped several democrat strongholds. He did just fine.
He can hook him up with a pink blouse. Courtesy of big mamma.
I wonder what the laws are if you bartered for a gun. I wash your car, you give me a glock.

This may be overreacting, but I would not touch those presents. There could be a bomb in them. 
No worries. I'll look into this for sure.
Yeah I'd recommend it, definitely an easy watch
I don't think I'd like that either.
She already is. The darling that WTA so badly needed with the talent to back

Happy belated cakeday.

Shaving her legs, hoping the video didn‚Äôt cut short and that‚Äôs all she shaved in there....
Thank you for this. This sub isn‚Äôt a rating or selfie sub. There‚Äôs literally no poly content on this post.
[NAME] was actually cool this episode though.
I was grouping twitter with it. Tweets were great this year
No they are not.
#Art by Smouii on Paladins , [Find the artist on twitter as well
Makes me want to go shit on the doorstep of 540 Hampshire Street (Good2go HQ)
Maybe you just don't like women that much...
Ah thanks üëçüèª
Excess of 300 partners and not using protection is unappealing to me, I dont want catch anything 
I appreciate you taking the time to at least justify your reasoning but I still very much disagree.
Nice try, officer.
Aw, she came home early to surprise you! She must have missed you a lot.
Tortilla chips are the worst oml. One time a piece got lodged between my gum and my tooth. Like, that fella was /deeply/ embedded in my gum
Interesting how researching a candidates stances and history instead of blindly voting translates to ‚Äú higher standard ‚Äú.
Lol I need to see this movie again.
Yeah take a read
Not really. All pretty random injuries.
Interestingly enough I think it just needs to be the heavy creamer, my wife has some sensitivities to some dairy but not all forms of it. 
Ive gone through very similar things...i completely understand. Praying wont do much, seek a therapist to talk about things
I didn't know of [NAME] before I saw that episode. I fucking love that man and have watched an unhealthy amount of him since.
I dare each or any of you fuckasses to try and blame [NAME] for this one
Omg this is repulsive
That guy is an actor. Forgot his name but he's in imdb, played small roles. 
That last story was absolutely beautiful and sad.
Y‚Äôall are the bomb thank you :)
supposed to be brain ache but I am too tired with all these losses i have
Looking at that data, it suggests it fills up when the snowpack melts in the summer.
They really need to bring [NAME] son back to do more flashback scenes of young [NAME]. That would be SO GOOD
I was actually looking in to this game, glad they did this now so I can avoid it, yeesh
love that guy
I spend a lot of time worrying about how and why that'll happen to me as I get older.
? What do you mean? This is my favorite video game.
I only use freedom units, sorry.
I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt name him Allesandrostien
I'm so hyped to see this mitchy and matthews line
It's also the only title that doesn't have to be defended. Convenient that.
I loved [NAME]. She was too fine. [NAME] and [NAME] too. S1 babes were the best.
That they will always love me despite how erratic I am and that they will always care about me, even if I haven't seen them in years.
Serious question, why is she still employed? There are many talented women in WWE.
*IIII blessss the eeggsss!!!!*
I'm sorry to break the news to you. :(
I want to see that too, but we all know it's not going to happen.
My neighbor does the same, except hers lights up.
Enjoy
If only there was some other school that had a bunch of 5 star receiver commits as well...

I have no idea what that means.
Hahah. I wish I could say that‚Äôll get less painful with time but it won‚Äôt. Sorry my dude. F

As we shouldn't. We are trying to win a SB here not showcase another star player.
Didn‚Äôt you guys have a bowl game?
Until it gets to a point where you are a stalker.
An accurate but depressing assessment of our political system.
I‚Äôve only gotta PC, so I legit googled this thinking that this was actually what happened hahahahahahha
The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.
"""Assault Weapons"""
Oh yes! Here's an Imgur link to the first three I saw.

Philly and Shock seem to be reliant on having extremely good DPS, so they could be at a disadvantage in goats.
Dont mind him/her, they have decided that anything which kinda speaks against the whole Apartheid is to blame for everything for the next 150 Years is bad. 
I consider everyone attractive in their own way, so everyone is intimidating.

I love having twins. They'll keep each other company in their room until about 7:30-8:00 every day. So nice.
And I dub thee [NAME]. An uninteresting name for an uninteresting person who has done absolutely nothing with their life.
That‚Äôs a new level of blonde I never knew existed!
It would be really bad for relations between the two cities if we took Memphis' NBA team.
I get your point. But really, the low prices is just a trap to get more men in lookout for action. It's sad.
There is such a thing as too big, but this ain‚Äôt it, chief. Any bigger I would probably agree.
Made me so angry to read that, I almost downvoted your comment. Upvoted, for sure. Grr! 
"Hey, I bought a few issues of ""Lady Death"" and it was awesome! I wasn't hanging posters though."

No, I'm anti racism.
It's a contract / vendor management position more than anything
She's still looking for her [NAME], maybe? :)
This maybe my favorite thing I've ever seen on this subreddit. I took a screenshot and I'm sending it to husband. OP thanks for the laugh
From your username and the fact that you had to type that you‚Äôre NOT underage: now feels like you are
Id rather do the highlights again just not a full match.
[NAME] is so frisky this season.
FBI open up
Thank yoooouuuuu ‚ù§Ô∏è

Therapists hate this trick!
"[Licks salt] ""Hey guys, this *definitely* isn't snow!"""

True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. 
I can‚Äôt wait to try the cleric class again!
Dude you‚Äôre honestly unhinged. I think you need a break from the internet for today... it‚Äôll do you some good.
How he dropped that sheep, probably going to hell but i almost choked laughing. 
Yeah I mentioned this route and how we won because the other teams kept wasting chances.
That‚Äôs awesome! VPD and the Mounties should do the same here.
Wasn‚Äôt the black saber first seen in the Clone Wars? But otherwise all true.
You‚Äôre killin me smalls. Hilarious.
We need [NAME] to take a 7 year deal or less. I can picture the Dodgers giving [NAME] 7 years

I feel like I'd actually really like the song all together
You're good.
With that logic, women shouldn't be able to drive cars considering they are more prone to accidents/wrecks. Would you agree?
Looking through the lives of various figures of the New Atheist movement in the social and political change they sought to create and how it stacked up with reality.
What would you do if y'all end up having kids, but break up later? There's no guarantee y'all will be together forever. 
[NAME] pulling in his inner [NAME]
Even [NAME] got sick of grunge
The point we're making isn't that it IS an alt-right position, but that only the alt-right would pretend it is.
Lol, well if it's any consolation, I thought it was funny
Lol no.
Thank you very much. Follow up question what is a suura?
I heard on the scanner app of two trauma patients to IMC.

It's so difficult keeping track on who is friendly with who in the Middle East. How are Iraq:s relations with Turkey and their own Kurdistan nowadays?
Me since 2011 and still going strong :)
What the actual fuck?
Can relate. The spirit kept telling me to move to the Morridor. Total decade+ long disaster in almost every way. Shoulda stayed where I was.
That's not how they decide things. It's a political entity like any other and other members exert pressure, there are compromises, etc.
Not to be confused with the toughest guy in the streets of Harlem.
I love doxies. They're absolutely the best most pain in the ass wonderful loyal dogs.
Shipping container? More like an entire aircraft carrier covered in it.
I'm a danger to myself
Congrats dude! Can you give us a quick tl;dw?
Actually made me feel worse. Kids are always back there, death would have been guaranteed had they any.
We have laws against all that. Get the police to do take action.
I can, but not that kind.
I'm happy that you got the [NAME] back, some people just don't have respect for others and think that they and their kids deserve everything
I love it here too.
Pure asshole.
I've removed your post for witch hunting. Please be mindful of that in the future.
You got it chief.
I'd be worried about the tone, not the content.
Some people on here are infatuated with his infatuation.

Wait you confuse me , [NAME] orb can be deflected , unsure on the healing one tho [NAME] dash CD is 7 second not 11
I was there on the opposite side of the field. I did not believe he made that catch until we saw it later on tv. Unreal.
Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for ‚Ç¨149. $500 is insane!
Nah, you‚Äôre totally one of those MAGAmers. Your comments could‚Äôve come straight out of the subreddit.
He said great investment definitely not lost is this sub going to get back on track. Just because a post is bad doesn't mean they're lost.
Let‚Äôs learn to love our neighbors like the [NAME] learned in Rome
I think I can agree with you here, I kinda forgot about the military.
"Saying ""no"" five-ten times then a reluctant ""yes"" to shut you up is not consent!"
thank [NAME]. maybe we will finally get to have some proof of life for [NAME] and get some answers about [NAME].
Because he's in dirt, and probably didn't have much practice

The ghost of [NAME] saves the day!
I get so much [NAME] ads and BS conspiracy video recommendation just because I watch some gun videos... I honestly hate our gun culture in this country..
Sanctions are immoral and don't do anything but cause more human suffering, disappointing to see that this sub will support them, but not really a shock. 
[NAME] received millions of dollars from an MLM by endorsing it. Not sure what is so complicated about this indisputable fact for you.
It makes anyone unattractive.
Would love to have him come back to the organization in some way. GOAT.
holy mother of oof
This is a great idea. I'd even figure out where my printer ended up after I moved and set it up for this.
Not sinking in is it. I'm hardly speaking in riddles. Good luck
I meant characters like [NAME] or [NAME], but that works too.
‚ÄúWow. Just .. wow. Read a book, sweatie!‚Äù

"Dear [NAME] man! (Irony intended) You didn't say ""proof"" you said ""evidence""!"
Did he run them into the car? It hasn't been proven that he was holding a gun. As of now it is only on the kids
And Mac and cheese is shit too. If a grown man has to eat children's food, then STAHMs can get minimum wage jobs
Because the first part of the day was pretty lame, amirite?
Goodbye cruel world.
Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed.

The idea that fb might be slowly killing mlms out there gives me a glimmer of satisfaction...
Watched Batman vs Superman and been awed by more [NAME] references then New Testament?
A new apartman will give you peace of mind. Start saving up.
I wonder if we will get to actually see the demise of their relationship. I doubt they will do it on the show though.

That‚Äôs a different guy but I love [NAME]
damnnn wendell. just willed that one in
I wish the federal government would step in to take care of people. It‚Äôs overwhelming to care for them on a city or even state level.

Hmm ok, ya this is pretty aweso...uhhhh nvm.
Thanks man I appreciate that! I just feel like I'm in a tailspin of not being good enough and idk how to get out of it
You have no regard for due process or the law if you're suggesting [NAME] be charged with evidence tampering because there is nothing to back up that claim.
No one ever laid on their death bed and said, ‚ÄúI regret not working even harder.‚Äù
No, some of us thought it was gross back then too.
It's great that you're a recovering addict, that's cool. Have you ever tried DMT?
I appreciate the advice! This is something I‚Äôve been trying to figure out, like I said.
I wish there was a bridge there, because then that would have been worth it. This river is the biggest pain in my zone!
For real! It was like a shining beacon in the night!
[NAME] could rebound and still be overpaid, depending on how hard he rebounds.

[NAME], with his 8th appearance he's the most veteran player there

The problem with C4 wasn't that it was short, but that nothing really happened. 
I'm slightly ashamed to say I thought that was what the title implied too. Glad that's not the case

Rain and snow, the whitetail mountains would have looked so nice covered in snow
Myself preferring daytime, 2 to 2.5 hours would be more than reasonable as long as the effect to the SB is not work stressing.
This isn't really wholesome
He said this awhile ago. His splits away from coors scares me.
HOW DOES ONE CONTACT [NAME] TO PRESENT THEIR FIRSTBORN FOR ONE?!?!?!
How does that work on joystick though? Never played on console, is this still a problem?
I thought you were suggesting a bigger knife for a second.

">We should just turn the word ""love"" into ""rape"" so that liberals say they rape their moms!"
Where do I sign up, then? Haha.
I see two possibilities in the middle: Playing advocate, or playing devil.
says the insecure idiot who just had to dig through my comment history to try to get back at me. lol creep
But in an even lower res
Yeah cause no man has ever been falsely imprisoned due to allegations proven later to be false
Sooo good!
Lol, believe me you would know. 
You‚Äôre a vile vile person and a rapist. I hope the police are onto you.
"He missed my personal favorite of ""harridan"" though. "
Well good...opera is often beautiful..though it retains the stink of the upper classes.. I cant help but deride art that caters to high society to stay alive.
Organs are literal superfoods and it weirds me out there hasn't been some fad diet with them yet.
You quack!
Let‚Äôs see, this house is designated Zone R3, which allows for cats, dogs, telephone answering monkeys...
I don‚Äôt think she beat [NAME] but I def believe she hits this dude and [NAME].. none of this is news tho
Exactly....we need a car tunnel, and then let the old road to be allowed for truck traffic.
Totally agree with you. Just saying that [NAME] is not a stupid person. A smart person that will be spending the rest of his life in prison
That glo up though. Omg üòçüòçüòç
He‚Äôs legally blind... medical marijuana is a thing bro... got any on ya?
Ok thank you!
...soooooo yes?
Yeah I could definitely see that, which is sad.
We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.
So basically what we have is a horribly exploitative business model meant to prey on drivers by tricking them into accepting unprofitable rides.
[NAME] has turned into one of the NBA's great actors
I was going to suggest that it was likely a 96 or something. I could see how a 96 Dom would be $500 depending on the circumstances.
Too sore to make dinner tonight. Wong's Kitchen it is!
They want to make gun ownership so expensive and onerous that people won't even bother.
All good man haha
>I cant really see many objecting. Won't get through parliament, precisely because no deal might well win.
[NAME] has an actual Fire Emblem channel and his fanbase plays Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem Heroes. That's a pretty big difference.
You could wish for it to cure stupidity atleast. Obviously it doesnt.
Damn, what a savage. Spoken like a true brother. X'D
Yes, huge problems. Buy it anyway. Such a sexy car with the power and fun to drive factor to match.
What is the chair in the photo? I'm torn between sex toy and torture device.
Some very fine, well developed grade school humor right there.
I actually listened to the entire joke... and I read the press release from the CHRT. How about you?
Thank you so much! I know I deserve better, it just hard moving on and knowing that it‚Äôs finished.
Was there for a game v the lions in in 2016- WELL WORTH IT!
for 150 million!
Sweaty irritates me. But Its not exactly drag lingo. I've seen it on so many other subs too.
I hope if you ever have need of help for mental illness that the person who responds is not like you.
As long as the ink isn‚Äôt on a contract, I don‚Äôt listen to any rumors. Waste of time
Everyone‚Äôs a god damned critic. Try doing five minutes of stand up and see if you don‚Äôt end up on this sub.
WAIT IS THIS FUCKING LOSS!?!
The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.
That is not a side swipe. That's a full on t-bone. But I hope they all made it through somehow.
Thank you [NAME] goodnight
Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don‚Äôt stare, though. 
I genuinely don't think he is. Those features with a friendly smile or a cheeky grin, backed up by a good personality could totally get it.
Well said. Glad to see that there are still open minded people left in this sub.
And it tastes great because it was chilling in my refrigerator
Also you forget to say how it triggers an Id check which only a assistant can circumvent
It's been a long time since that was true, but thank you.
Need to change the subject of this post or it will be removed quickly but I hope those scum bags end up in jail.
Yes, I wouldn't have said it if it weren't true lol. It's owned by InBev which is a Belgian company. 
Sorry guys, I went a little far... You can read my apology post here.
I watch it 4-5 times every time it comes up. I think there is something wrong with me...
LSD or the fungal kind? Out of curiosity
I have and it didn't help. It's only a matter of time now for how long I can hold on.
Start acting mature. Don't get into fights with security guards about how you look.
good luck buddy
you are trying to use post-modern mumbo jumbo deconstruction of words. Go away, idiot.
There mostly isn't any. Nature merely found a way to encourage the behaviour that leads to babies aka sex.
Breath little dude, breath.
correct. [NAME] was our 3rd round pick. Hand lookin like the steal of the draft
Y'all i have option one. Lemme tell you. Sex is important. I miss it
That's what I was talking about. Eat one meal, then hibernate until you're so hungry you gotta eat again.
I am in fact a woman, but I'm not bothered by the assumption. Thank you :)
> [Citation needed] The fact that no woman will date you.
Why did you repost this 7 hours after your initial post!? And to the same sub!? Yo, that's not cool man.
Didn't even take a sip of the wine, and he still got wasted. 
What happened to [NAME]? I haven‚Äôt followed closely but I was under the impression he wanted to return but the club wanted to move on
Now defeat your dragons and clean your room.
I like Nurse. He shows grit. This is the stuff [NAME] should be doing.
It does infuriate me.
I wish they would have focused on them in the first movie, and slowly handed the torch off to the next gen by the 3rd.
Wow OP sounds like you're really skilled at opening your legs, you're parents should be proud of you, STI and all.
I love you and I love your style. Nice work. Bullies should not be rewarded
Kind of strange when one country was nuked and the other wasn't.
Honestly after he was so reasonable and calm throughout this confrontation, the hatchet man tattoo made me chuckle. Definitely unexpected.
The foul, smelly dump I just took > fallout 76
Im loving these DBS and canuck meme mixtures
When your dog dies, you will realize how absurd this statement is.
This is disgusting.... please make more.
[NAME] just knocked him over but okay cool
Appreciate the reply, I'll look into these. Thank you!
Satire account.
have a talk with her to see if she likes you and if you're going to ask her out go for it, ask her in person. 
fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses
Via Napoli in Epcot is amazing, but no garlic bread (the pizza is great though). 
Haha dude, love your spirit. But. It's not all shit (the cuisine that is), let's not overgeneralize and become the shitheads we are criticizing.
Lovely. If you have no success in finding a copy I'd be more than happy to post it to you.
"I work at a salon and we have a ""no kids unless it's their appointment"" rule. It's amazing."
Correct! Unfortunately, we're looking for a bit more computing experience than knowing what site you're on. Thanks for your interest though.
Thank you. And I love your flair. My toddler is the same haha
Ah, I've only been for music and didn't purchase much else. I figure it would have the downtown markup though.
No way a tattooed ex-con with a drug/drinking problem might turn abusive!
Nice. How is prep going??
Obvious troll is obvious.
Go get some sleep buddy, it'll be alright.
ye but that is fucking [NAME]... there is a diffrence between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is good but he is no [NAME] ;)
Not all comedy is for everyone. Check out some of their other stuff, though. They're overall hilarious.
Probably past 11 est at this point
Well, bless your heart
You seem to be unwilling to talk about the actual facts here.
Dammit as a mom of boys that made me straight up tear up
Deservedly so too. Tbh I think you must be the favourites.
"This used to be the biggest circle jerk for dayz ""guys its alpha!"" Oh' how the mighty have fallen."
Mate honestly what you had was a serious relationship with her, for all 13 years. I hope you heal up well.
I know one time I mixed stuff up and posted the slashes instead of the asterisks to italicize. Oops.
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING!
And only $300+ a night, beautiful but expensive.
How can anyone like Tottenham? Like for real. They are the worst team you could imagine in every department.
Never. He cheated multiple times, and each time I had an idea before I had proof. Listen to your gut. 
Damn that‚Äôs a lot of reposts!
Did you remember [NAME]?
It's the [NAME] of hot dogs
It‚Äôs rebranded as the ‚ÄòQuarter Note Hotel‚Äô. For now.
Damn for real?
It was just as illegal yesterday ... nothing changed
How can [NAME] be so stupid?
I AM THE GOLDEN GOD
Hey there [NAME] what's it like in new york city
How does ones SO even go through your ph ? Mine is locked with a pass code and a finger print
My grandchild used to be a baby, and now he is no longer a baby. Thanks, xBox!
that's the only thing i remember from this book
Hope they will, but I doubt some of the dems in dc.
‚ÄúOh hey, I think a second ago [NAME] just put a move on [NAME]! Oh boy I wonder how that was.‚Äù
He looks like a toddler who got to dress himself.
you can bring all your cards to the game
I'm not sure what that is
"Your ""other people"" comment was."
"So they are saying ""We'd rather you spend your money elsewhere?"" to their employees? I"
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
They obviously sent the funds to Binance because they didn't want them to get hacked on some shady exchange like Cryptopia.
How‚Äôd you get out there? I miss the west. Love NYC tho
"glad to see youtubes ""family friendly"" robots have their priorities straight. "
That was [NAME], Guice is juicy
If you‚Äôve never been to DSA you‚Äôd be surprised by how many amazing, smart people you‚Äôll meet. 
Ah, alt right thinking. Afraid of people who have anything 'upstairs,' or 'between their ears.'
YES [NAME], we're rooting for you! üéâüéâ
I'll kill you if you do that again, *honey*
Yeah but nobody will come to take note of it until Thursday at the earliest
You mean your WolfDog Hybrids? Kidding.
Yep, this is all I needed. See you guys later, Ima go jump off a cliff
They would definitely prefer that to the current situation
You think this really happened?
It's as though it all melts away the moment you realize it's not true.
Thank you!
Thats insane. Someone died like 2 years ago after a bolt got kicked up by a truck and went through his windshield and hit him on 146 in LaPorte
Hang on is that allowed? Geez that guy seemed really angry.
Belive in yourself
Ugh this moment really had me crying lol just hearing him remember all the good I was like WHY
Lmaoooo how‚Äôd you miss him that close üòÇ sweet justice
I‚Äôm convinced WB is more of a pain than it‚Äôs worth. Good luck making adjustments during the semester. I feel your pain.
"Never liked hip hop. Grew up around gangster life style, hated it. I also laugh at the ""mythology"" that grew up around it. "
Does anyone have a link to the rainbow song clip? I tried looking everywhere and can't find it :(
>only ones who really suffer are sport and competition shooters. Which is likely the whole point What makes you think that?
You‚Äôre right but territories haven‚Äôt been around for decades
A the_donald poster trying to pass as a human being has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
Oof, that was efficient 
Because our capitalist system is creating ignorant voters by design.
I dated one for about a month, and just one or two dates with a couple other guys. 
Sorry, but [NAME] is too POWERFUL, not to be his own character. But seriously i definitely now want this.
Nope don't you know? Warden is god-like cuz that bash
Would I love to be a fly on your wall right now and watch this whole debacle.
Cuz [NAME] sat out lol
So sorry, for your loss.
Oh i already watched the whole thing when it aired. That match was awesome! I just wanna rewatch the last 20 mins of the womens rumble
Sweet! I'm a Packers fan in Winnipeg. Really hoping to catch a game there next season.
Okay, that was actually shocking.
What a pretentious, self-promoting post.
[NAME] if they're doing wrestling probably fine
Awe! That sucks!
I'm looking forward to this way more than Captain Marvel. It's actually not even close
Man you'd be shocked to know some women still remain passive even when married.
She's probably increased in usage now cause people want the wins for that Bastet skin lol
What about for the Switch?
Why this post is downvoted? It makes me happy to read something like this.
Ignorance is bliss
19??? Yikes slow down, enjoy yourselves and figure yourselves out. Not an age to make big decisions like that, I say at 24...
no its not lmao
"""This droid has a bad motivator."""
No we're not? Y'know the capsule bug happened on every server and not the ones which fit your narrative
K... I guess I'll just take your work for it.
Hidden underneath everything else.
I avoid them like the plague and report them
I mean it doesn't say anything about comments? Anyways who cares it's a celebrity its his fault.
me as fuck
I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
Much less legal racism, much more corruption, crime, dysfunction, decay etc
Which episode was this?
Can you even imagine the brain damage required to think like that? [NAME].
That poor soul
#welcome to Doordash lol We all quit Doordash
7-3 is the best thing I've ever done with my life
Omg at this rate he's gonna be in the next smash bros
Ugh [NAME] is like when your ex-girlfriend suddenly gets really hot. I can't even look at him.
I‚Äôm here for you. What would you like to discuss?
Seattle's train is nice... once you get there. It is an absolute hike from the terminal
Ur actually stupid lol.
lol out loud
Id like to see Finland win it. But id like to see [NAME] and [NAME] carry their teams in every way possible to those losses.
I guess so ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I actually did have a girl a few towns away in a different school and no one knew her. No one believed me at first :(
Thank you for that. My gf jumped right next to me! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Haha this is one of those moments that makes me laugh out loud
I'm saying I've only ever seen one case of obvious hacking
Pm me I'd love to buy it from you if you have any spare!
It isn't, if it turns out good, and it did.
Please [NAME] that‚Äôs how I want to go!
lol at them both getting downvotes
Some say [NAME] is still trapped to this day in those abs.
Kinda reminds me of the 11 foot 8 videos. Sooo
Sour Tangie!
so [NAME] isn't necessarily as dumb as she literally appears... I've always liked her for some reason.
[NAME], we have a guy with a bucket on his head and you have pornstars. I‚Äôm glad I live on this side of the Atlantic 
Except trophy hunters, although take away their gun and see how well they fare then.
Possibly. He spent time in the crypts, but he was told in no uncertain terms that, as a bastard, he didn't belong there.
You sure seem angry. #itwillbeokay
I like your attitude. You seem like a good person.
That looks like food for a 12 year old.
Wow. That is shockingly uncool.
Take a note to PM me if you do, I'll happily pay for one!
I vote to now refer to him as [NAME] from now on due to his newfound confidence
do some blow and spice, it'll be just another day in Florida for Florida man
I would totally park in front of their house. They have as little right to complain as you do.
Actually good point, I should have asked for the source their too. It was only a rumor when I first heard. Might be wrong, sorry.
Well this is frustrating.
It bothers me that he doesn‚Äôt respond to your texts. That‚Äôs weird
Yessir. And I live in Dallas. Stop being salty freefreebradshaw.
Thanks for cheering me up!?
yeah he was a good defender in Utah
I was wondering if that would be spotted. It is from the movie Split. saw the image on Reddit and immediately thought of lions.
Yeah it‚Äôs fine. Some supplements contain Ashwagandha which affects the gaba receptors so be cautious if you‚Äôre already on gabapentin or a beta blocker
And the problem?
Oh boy is this gonna be the new thing? Cause I like it.
Wow you summed it up perfectly. Where can I find one of these rare specimens?
"We're all humans, why would a darker skinned [NAME] not be ""one of their own""?"
My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(
Hell yeah it did!
Wow. It looks really good!
Didn't like [NAME] and when he was here, hate him on the opposing team
I love this.
I was raised solo parent so it was more of an angry hushed whisper when they thought I was in the other room.
Hey, you sound like you're living my exact life. It's a good life. Enjoy sharing the love. 
I think this would be common amongst musicians. I wonder if it's related to this discovery regarding muscle memory or if it's something else?
I love Simpsons alternative art because it really drives home how great these characters are and how relatable they are.
youre a disgusting piece of filth.
Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]
I would gleefully look forward to a battle where fascist apologists and race baiters utterly destroy each other. Maybe then we can have a civil, unified society.
I can't help but agree with the headline at the bottom, bright side (the YouTube channel) is annoying.
It will be painful but it will be worth it! Good Luck, and may you never be a slave to a drug again !
Yea it's pretty fantastic. I got lucky that despite being fairly TBM she enjoys passionate, frequent sex.
Are you new to drag race skits?
"So your sticking by the term ""extremist"" for this massive chunk of the population."
5. Very likely
Directly tell me why you felt the need to threaten my life.
I think you should manage your hopes and expectations that you have about her. Start dating other people. Let her go
We may not have much connection playerwise anymore, but Flames will always be Mr. [NAME] special Western buddies.
Truly. This is how family stays family. I admire this child so much.
Dude, you just have to read the response and you can tell by the wording its something not even a foreign girl would word that way.
Lol sometimes I do feel like punching someone who I feel is whispering about me ,if I am drunk it would be very bad üòÇ
Poison is usually physically damaging
I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.
I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
Crating your dog is also banned in some places, that doesn't make it cruel.
you are a smart dude
I seen reactions to this elsewhere and DAM famales are some sensitive fucers, you see something online and your whole life fall apart like üôÇüñ•Ô∏èüò¢üò≠üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
[NAME] I wish that was a more active sub :(
Thank you. Edit: I have cancer now
Please don‚Äôt murder me
No thank you üòâ
I watch it every time I see it posted. There's something beautiful about watching someone so passionate and excited about what they've discovered :)
A site was the good site on old cobble, so they changed it and left the awkward B site alone. Thanks volvo
His opponent got DQ for pinching off [NAME] air tube. His first opponent is why [NAME] had the air tube in the first place.
Got it. Sorry you feel that way man. I hope you find your own way to impact the game or enjoy it next year.
Come on, New Day! Make it finally finally happen, [NAME]!
Mod like that should get doxxed honestly.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ONE GUY AND I WAS SERIOUSLY HERE TO POST ABOUT YOUTUBE'S COMMENT ALGORITHM BUT **OH YEAH YEAH**
Good tips. Will take into consideration everything you said. Thanks a lot !
Thanks! I ordered some and let them know I'm traveling so I think I'm pretty set
bet you could still eat them
I mean... this is some shit right here
talking about me again?
Mmm.. that would be a little bloody... I think I have a new fethish...
Oh I see
That damn FDR who America loved so much they had to write an amendment to the Constitution to keep anyone else from being elected that many times
Good mind, good luck.
End this relationship NOW. And please learn from it!!
I'm curious!!! The likes of [NAME] and [NAME] may have been choices for me in another timeline. Who took names that you know of?
She looks dead on the inside in the photoshopped pic
Goddamned masterpiece.
To be fair, all of those QBs may not have been starting quality but most of them ended up being solid backup else where in the league. 
Oh yeah, I forgot about the mean one.
Heavens to [NAME], guys, thank you so much for the gold! That was super-unexpected, but what a delightful thing to wake up to! :-D
I can respect profiting from morons.
Where did you get this? It's terrible.
america is pretty much the least class-conscious country in the world so it shouldnt be a surprise. everyone thinks that one day theyll be management so its cool
Several of the reaction they laughed so hard at were just people turning and looking. They just acknowledged they heard something.
And you didn't read the filler did you?
YES YOU SHOULD, although it's only in 2300. Surrounding communes get expensive quickly.
39/43, turns out I need to follow the academy team a little more...
Omg! I'm just about to post a recipe with turmeric because I ALSO FEEL THAT WAY.
Thanks for calling me an idiot... was definitely necessary.
With [NAME] ongoing back problems...I'll pass on seeing this lol
Fucking parking in the middle of the street through the entire strip of Allegheny
[NAME] has to use a gun to defend himself after multiple robberies and an attempted rape...
‚ÄúChildren transing is abuse though ... and I'm not even speaking about dangers of hrt‚Äù
‚ÄúUh, [NAME], lunch break was over 5 hours ago.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe failing of mistaking internet trend.‚Äù Clearly he is a grammatical genius.
[NAME] is awesome
Break up? Lol you lost me right there. I thought you were a rational dude until the mourning your ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù. Decent troll 6/10
Sorry [NAME] is our best friend now
I Like [NAME]
Its just a prank bro.
I'd love to collab with some reddit folks on NFL Draft prospect scouting, rankings and mock drafts if anyone is interested.
Even if it‚Äôs available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won‚Äôt buy it.
Thanks for the insight. I guess I‚Äôm coming off a bit ignorant and maybe naive.
Not threatening? It is an exhortation to commit a violent sexual act against a woman.
Be careful, or he'll have to use 10% of his power on you!
I'm on my legal age and he's my second partner. I wil try to find more about it...
Also them dealing with mean and petty people especially in school
Thanks bud, hope it‚Äôs a great one!
But it's soooo obvious.
That actually looks super, super cool.
Man at this point I'd be happy with just a few non-sweeps.
Interesting, no denial about being an unwelcome individual. If my suspensions are public knowledge then prove it. 
I have run into a few clients when I was out doing stuff. Sometimes I would run away, unless they were cool.
Did you know your post about your comment being downvoted is also being downvoted?
That government was not democratically elected. But you knew that already.
Great news. Maybe they will be shut down.
We have a lot of people flying in and out of the country. No change to the usual lines, so not bad at all.
Yeah super confused about that considering it was only [NAME] she had beef with lol
It was such a strange error.
Nah, girl, you did great. I'm also shocked by guys who want to hook up without a condom.
why do they look like their all wearing gas masks
And he be like - great and you? I'm like Great. And the conversation ends lol :-)
[NAME] threw the first bricks at Stonewall.
Omg more than anything I want to see [NAME] block a game winner from [NAME].
you fucking moron
[NAME], you are such a pretty girl. 
"It's a difficult one really, because some customers would probably be offended if he said ""your husband or wife"". "
i said first world :)
Agreed. Very relevant suggestion!
~~love is love~~
Anyone know the [NAME] choke move from Mortal Kombat X? My dude here just demonstrated it perfectly in real life.
You'd be surprised how much control [NAME] has in your life. I've experienced it first hand. Mentally.
Actually this is very clear thinking. This is the best answer on this thread. Thank you.
Fun fact: the average person eats 5 dogs in their sleep, checkmate veegunz
We are like the douchebusters!
America.... I have done goofed!
Very surprised he didn't frog leap at the guy the close the distance
Couldn't agree more. The fact that all the fans are feeling for the breakup means that she managed to create and develop characters we genuinely care about.
Congratulations - you're truly a [NAME] now.
So there's hope for the rest of us! Thanks for sharing. What helped you get to where you are?
I would‚Äôve gotten the ‚Äúoooh lights!‚Äù look from the truck if I‚Äôd tried that
That's just a tad frosty. I'm ready to ice skate to work on thursday amsterdam style.
In such a polarized time, we can all recognize each other's common humanity in the fact that no one likes [NAME] best. 
Sounds like my soon to be ex wife
So is that like your opinion or a viewpoint you can back up with solid reasoning?
Thanks bot, I was and plan to have a great day despite this negativity in this comment section.
That, plus they also store our info insecurely so it leaks out. Just another part of this dumb economics game I guess...
Those scars look fairly recent. Just remember no matter what there are people who love you and will support you unconditionally!
Rather than having to guess at which part you consider a strawman, maybe you could just quote it for me. I may not always recognise fallacies.
‚ÄúBrave‚Äù is one way of describing it
> it‚Äôs a low f-ing bar lbr It is indeed. But I am glad that you found a man who doesn't want anal.
He's the reason why they unable to win it in the first place.
Mumbling on twitter and r/politics. Also [NAME] is getting annoyed as well. He is mr appropriations after all.
Hi, [NAME]! I thought I would stop by and wish you a wonderful and prosperous year! Have a good one! -HappyFriendlyBot
I thought it was but didn't find anything in Reddit's horrible search. Thank you and I apologize for this.
Of course you have to play your cards right, but having good cards can really help you. It‚Äôs all about tact. 
The character [NAME], is it only useable in Blackout mode? Or can you use it in multiplayer?
I'm afraid you have your terms mixed up -
Don't kink shame
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to the poor execution of the hanging? He only used half of the holes
> Im a milan fan I'm so sorry.
Fitter faster stronger better
What a beauty
This is pretty bad advice. Do not use dreams own encryption. And do not use things such as igolder
There's more updates further down.
[NAME] needs to demand more from his staff and have longer practices. Idk something needs to change because they constantly underperform especially on the road.
Thank you! Looks delicious.
[NAME] was mediocre for several years in a row even if he was winning. He matches [NAME] more than anyone
the socially weak kid who is also: - neurotypical - not too short - not too ugly so basically a normie
Thanks for the reply. You're right though. If you make a scene about it, you might as well be tattling. Go Browns
Passion is the best.
I run both, use my bl, next chase, dh. Even with exhausted, bl has that stagger reduction, so you can kite killers
My opinion is that anyone smart enough would simply not work for [NAME] in the first place.
All I see is a missed opportunity to pet a wolf tummy.
Everyone forgot to tell you the 1st step is to marry the Sheriff's daughter.
This was the first episode I ever saw, and it got me hooked!
Lots of them are in really beautiful unique buildings. The one in folkestone in particular is pretty amazing.
Yep. That whole second kid thing is no joke.... Soon this will be a distant memory. That‚Äôs what I tell myself
Why is [NAME] me though lmao
Don‚Äôt blame [NAME] there tf is he supposed to do if our wing can‚Äôt stay in front of their man
I'm sure there's a trash bag full of 'em around there somewhere. Probably next to the insulin. You want some?
You win the Internet today. Fuck all the other winners. You‚Äôre the real one.
I guess without me you would just go on mistakenly thinking [NAME] was a part of the Dodgers ownership group.
But the other amendments were scrapped.
That is one cute baby. I don‚Äôt think all babies are cute either. But this is a really cute baby.
That‚Äôs kind of cool! You made a friend at the store. I usually make people want to leave.
They should build the wall out of [NAME] emails. After all, no one can get over them.
I'm 100% sure you were punched in the face, but this was a good one
*fingers in ears* LALALALALA EVERYTHING'S FINE. Check out [NAME] twitter feed for similar attacks. r/Alberta is definitely slightly left, but distrust of [NAME] is spreading.
Oh but that was like a positive love story. It didn‚Äôt really showcase all the problems with online dating.
Hi, top minds!
It is honestly just garbage, I'm surprised they're allowed to be ads
I‚Äôm jonesing like [NAME] on her wedding night!!!
I definitely rushed it. What do you think I missed?
That's some legendary teamwork exhibited right there.
It's a fact tho. So your accusations are simply based on misinformation.
Please wake up
I think Judge came in a little too late so he‚Äôll need to be amazing for the next 8 years
If you were gonna chloroform the person why not just get a hold of a fresh dead body instead? Move just as much.
That was a bad fastbreak lol
They r playing
So no resignation or impeachment. Bummer. Naive me had high hopes the great [NAME] wouldn't escape the noose this time.
i think it is characteristic for la liga, in germany that would be atleast +3
Hate people like this
So like most of the pros you got more time to play blackout. Which is the only good thing about this game.
Nope, you're right, it's the same tweet you're thinking of, check the date. 
Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch
Yeahhhh no, you're banned for this whole convo.
[NAME] has awoken from his winter sleep.
Sweet, [NAME] 1 I assume?
Thanks for your insight random person on the internet. Did it make you feel better typing that out lol?
I assume breaking a bone but idk, I've never broken a bone 
Interesting that these two have made such a splash. I might check into this season if it's worth watching.
they dont have to buy all of it.
Bleak but may be accurate. I wonder - are there examples of other franchises that went down the toilet, but that then actually make a comeback?
No, but when you're family sees, like, 12 books of it, it can certainly make things awkward.
[NAME] to me will forever be proof that the true dangerous people are not the ones telling lies but rather the people that believe them.
And isolated rooms? When I had to go in with my baby with chickenpox they put us in a room where no one else was.
YouTube is also fantastic for this stuff too.
I meant one sided comment. My bad
Congratulations on the embroidery, and on quitting tobacco!
so you can't state it definitively, therefore you think it's a possibility so i was right all along. i thought so
So thoughtful.
Rude to NXT. They need to just let her go. She hasn‚Äôt improved in over a decade, she‚Äôs never going to
this is killing me LMAO
So he‚Äôs gonna swear at you in Klingon?
But see methods never got screwed over because he basically got traded to a PL team
Different region of same hellscape. Congrats, good luck!
[NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.
if [NAME] got any more attention i'd really like it to be with [NAME].
I have vaguely heard he was maybe, possibly going to make a statement in regards to no new taxes, but who knows. 
That one is my favorite btw, its delicious. sorry you couldn't have it :(
It‚Äôs not even bad
I was putting my comment on why and when PC players (like yourself) will complaine. Seems I wasn't too far off
Wow... I‚Äôm so glad that my dog is lazy like me.
"It's called ""internalised misogyny"" and feminists are aware of it and discussing it. Thanks for your concern though."
[NAME] freaking [NAME] all the people down range just staring. -_- GO INSIDE DUMBASSES.
>They talked about it a lot in early 2017, specifically mentioning r/Minnesota. Lol, someone found one comment that had 3 points.
His team is chasing away any hope at a playoff berth
I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.
Then you should feel right at home!
This is something I try to do every day and it makes me feel so at peace
This is why nobody takes feminism seriously!
That‚Äôs how you know they‚Äôre happy.
They are children, they have no souls. 
I‚Äôll bet he insists he loves both of you because for him love is just serving his needs.
And everybody clapped! Fuck this loser!
This makes me so sad :‚Äô( Well done OP!
Everything. Everything is wrong with being hypocritical.
Well, she was completely and utterly heartbroken. By my stupidity. So there's that.
So thankful for the conclusion. Having no idea how this played out was definitely going to haunt me
It's not murder if he wants to die, it's euthanasia. She doesn't necessarily have to be the one to do it. 
You got me
I remember them looking very happy. I loved that they were there and seemed very happy about what was happening.
My first thought was ahh who was the RuPaul contestant with the insane legs? [NAME]!! Legs for dayssssss!! Thanks for saving my brain!
[NAME] what do you do with his underwEAR
>provide a credible source. You first. For each claim.
And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords.
I'm 34 and disappointing my mother is still my greatest fear.
Yeah, it‚Äôs a really similar thing. Some kids love it, some kids are really freaked out. 
Can we ban this person? Post history is sketch. Thanks in advance!
On the contrary, he gets off on his own ego and the delusion shattering reality of intimacy with another person makes him limp as a wet noodle.
0 <----- This is how many people were surprised
Pft, don't kid yourself. 
And perfectly perfect.
"More like ""thank you sir may I have another"""
Ahh, thanks for the response.
Should've gotten a prenup.
Good [NAME] ^(that's perfect)
Sorry, but this was already on our front page recently, so I'm gonna have to remove it. 
No. Arizona would be more useless than Italy. Let them win their own battles first before they help us fight ours.
Ouh shittt my dad is also going to be surprised
[NAME] is a pretry big role to fill. I hope you do well!
She looks JUST like that little girl [NAME] that won America‚Äôs Got Talent, the ventriloquist. 
I always admire a pinch of salt in anything. I can't upvote you enough sir.
Holy fuck, that save was on what was essentially a wide open net
You really need to learn to read. 32 isn't too late!
I'm a cis woman and your wardrobe sounds like like my ideal fall wardrobe!
I'm a woman, 50-adjacent, and a descendant of slaves. I like hot sauce but I hate [NAME].
Hey, at least he finds women!
>!I mean he did give himself a weird new arm...!<
Scat will NEVER be my thing. Or vomit.
"That's because it's called LATCH here and most people just call them ""car seat anchors"". Maybe that's why..."
I have tried to stay away from using the word ‚Äú[RELIGION]‚Äù as much as possible to stay agreeable with the current styling guide of the church.
Hi, [NAME]!
If it's used as an excuse to fuck the onchain throughput, it is.
Thanks mrs‚Äîmr [NAME]
I like [NAME] soo much! he‚Äôs such a sweet and honest person, and his voice is amazing
Ahem. Second best NA
Thanks! Been clipping her for awhile now, I think I‚Äôm going to stick with her 
No it‚Äôs true. However it is time to rethink how we recycle clothing in cities and the elimination of donation bins is step one.
We have youth and depth on our side. I feel good about what we have. If the Cubs have 2 injuries to their rotation they are toast.
[NAME] country is this entire world. I hate that saying.
Philanthropy really scares some people, doesn't it? People did this to [NAME] too. 
"Laughing at ""indoctrinated by traditional values"". Good luck in life."
Did the Bears corners really play that well or was their front 7 so dominant that it made them look better?
What did the dyslexic atheist insomniac do last night? He stayed up all night wondering if there was a dog
You look like a bear.... An ugly cartoon bear
You‚Äôre right. Pressing f.
Yea, a doctor that diagnoses based on how healthy a patient looks isn‚Äôt qualified for professional work as a doctor
I did not know that a map could arouse me
This is where [NAME] from OC belongs.
Hope you're havin a good trip my dude! Good vibes ‚úåüåà
plus what if something went missing? even if they didn't steal anything it would be an awkward moment.
Gotta love that bison
This is an issue I had with breaking bad. I love the show but sometimes the actors would talk so frigan quietly.
because your brain will associate the drip taste with the high after a few times, i love the drip
I still rock my Casey Hampton pro bowl jersey!!
If you're going out with a big group then this doesn't seem so bad. Everyone gets something to eat and it's fun.
Will do!!!! :D Thank you so, so much!!!
Definitely the current worst, hence 20 actually buffs coming her way.
FBI! OPEN THE DOOR!
Ah ok! I figured I was getting it wrong.
Wow, [NAME] acting like he got [NAME] Punched.
You are [NAME] and I claim my five pounds.
"Ugh why can't the commie just discuss about [NAME] serve instead of saying ""I'm sure he's more of a scientist than me"""
"""they can't come through the port"" He's obviously never seen The Wire"
Not to mention that half the women out there are immediately disqualified (at least in my book) by having kids.
She looks like a crackhead.
Don't you feel embarrassed at all that your country answers to a country literally opposite of the world from yours?
Whoever told you that is lying.
"""Didn't know you can predict the future"""
That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
ah so youre the guy who shows up to the party with one goal, to yell at people when they don‚Äôt play by his own rules
Yea it's a tricky one, we need more buttons!! 
Tbh I think there are a lot of parts of chicago that are way shittier than memphis
Lay off the drugs dude
I wonder if Belpedio will get a chance up here at some point.
"Your feelings have nothing at all to do with the question ""What is actually true?"""
Sell all bch for bitcoin and hope for a bull run. Best decision you probably will make in your life.
Dont worry guys, its all sanitary. He hit the wrench with some WD40 before he started.
Why dont you go complaint about USA 75% deforestation?
Lol. The majority of military jobs aren‚Äôt combat related.
"lol me too. _""Go on in you scraggly old bastard!""_"
Ooh you made them?! Awesome!! I hope you enjoyed them. 5 cheeses sounds like a great decision.
Do you boo boo. Live your best life
Fair enough, I didn't pay attention. 
Why are you even visiting /r/Artifact if you hate the game so much?
[NAME] TAKE MY HEART
The dying empire.
I just got banned from one of his subreddits, I haven't been this excited for a ban since the snap from /r/thanosdidnothingwrong!
[NAME] is too gullible for his own good.... watch out [NAME] definitely not a friend too
All the smut at Target makes me cringe. That, and the very clearly politically-charged children's books.
Some antique stuff might have lead mixed in, but brass does not intrinsically require lead and modern brass doorknobs certainly wouldn't as it would be a liability.
Thanks will check them out!
He sees you when you‚Äôre tweeting, He knows that you‚Äôre a fake, He knows that you love [NAME] So resign for goodness sake. 
[NAME] will be the 2nd best player in Juve team now.
The same Mr. [NAME] to Appeal to the Alt-Right Boogie, yes.
I feel you, mama. I hope tomorrow is a better day.
A stork bite your baby?!?! *kidding*
And soldiers. GIs love strip clubs. Especially in the podunk towns where bases are.
It‚Äôs like frank trying to eat that celery
And [NAME] solid one-word sentences
This sub: YOU SHOULDN'T SWERVE TO AVOID A COLLISION This sub: WHY DIDN'T SHE SWERE TO AVOID THE COLLISION
Huh, that explains it.
Out of curiosity, what's wrong with the tribal casinos? I've been many in Southern California that were great, are the ones on Washington bad?
I never disappoint, just ask your mother. ;)
Get a body pillow made of yourself and give it to her as a present when she misses you she can just hug the pillow
Not sure who to side with now
They likely just didn‚Äôt have enough forex to pay their bill üòÇ
It wasn't fair on the rest of the list, nothing is good as Tim Hortons.
Isn't this the plot of the show YOU on netflix? Be careful lmao.
Work on the pitching, that was a weakness of the team last season.
I'm seeing this everywhere, what does BEC mean?
Yes, but she isn‚Äôt even close to being one of the biggest artists of the decade, like some people have claimed here. 
awesome thank u!!
what level of bloom would you think is appropriate?
this meme is so old it whipped me back into 2011
sorry my fellow youngsters, we're illiterate.
More then a handful is to much anyways. You're all good lady. Confidence is sexy
Can attest. Vitamin deficiency here. Certain vitamins help alleviate bags under my well-rested eyes.
Been saying horford has been overrated since he got that fat contract
Raise them early in the way of the Braves! Congratulations!
Absolutely glorious morning. There is no better weather.
[NAME] was actually wrong all along. JAH > Jokic /s
They needed to insert the phrase ‚Äúover maintenance‚Äù in there.
[NAME] is one of the worst announcers ever. [NAME] is one of the best.
i cannot stand babies and i would run the other way which is all kinds of illegal if it's my own, haha. 
This aged poorly
And I thought we had 50, *five-pointed* stars on the flag?
That sounds a little paranoid
Aaaand everybody got diarrhea. Thanks dummy
I'll probably try this one day üòÖ
Better to spend the weekend in jail than get convicted of something you didn't do.
As a Kentucky fan I‚Äôve watched [NAME] all year and he is legit. Just wish there were a scenario that GB could pick him up.
Congratulations! Your kids are very lucky to have a strong and positive parent :)
"I'd love if this just quick-panned to [NAME] giving a brutal RBF while this moid fawned over her ""personality shining"""
[NAME] would be fun [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and possibly [NAME] would make us prime contenders for hard knocks 
Wow, you‚Äôre so generous with other people‚Äôs money.
No it's because we're ugly, short, and ethnic 
Yes officer, this one here
Lmao at this point she‚Äôll probably deliver Teddy/Owen‚Äôs baby.
I saw the one where he was successful, and wondered how many attempts it took. 
I have a feeling [NAME] and [NAME] aren't staying with the WWE once their contracts ends this year anyways.
Yes.... and ACT wanted brackets to be adjusted, but National did not. Being in government didnt mean ACT could force National on that point
Such a great movie that kinda gets overlooked.
You a probably more attracted to guys but might feel that being with woman is better accepted in society so you wish for both.
I was thinking that as well after I posted. Some nasty stuff settles on ceiling tiles.
Yeah I just want the damn photos.
Bingo! I would not/could not be in a relationship with someone who denies their child a parent by choice.
Look at this guy with the research.
Thanks mate. I'm going to repeat your words to myself until I start believing them. Thanks for giving me a bit of hope :)
fuck the caps!
I haven‚Äôt seen this format before. And I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs original. But I like it.
Because lost media presents a question with no answer. Humans are curious creatures, so presenting them with knowledge that cannot possibly be learned is extremely frustrating.
I want 10 - 0. This organization deserves the embarrassment.
"There's a crocodile who's not hungry. Pissed off but not hungry. ""Get the f--- off me!"""
Lmao, I have actually seen this happen at a [NAME] gig, so yeah, probably true.
That's kinda a cruel thing to say cause she's your best friend?
He needed to back off a little. He‚Äôs forcing it too much. Give her a second. You‚Äôre practically a stranger.
I'll bite. What's your story?
Rematch against UVA, eh? First one to 40 wins!
Many people. We just don't always hear about it but I've done some research on that in the past.
Nah... that's a slippery slope. Let's just take away their freedom and put them in a place where they can't have anymore kids
She‚Äôs cool as hell
I think they think that they have created the best cod ever and everyone who doesn't think that is wrong
I hated him too, just keep watching. Every character has their own personal journey which is such an admirable aspect of this show.
What the hell did you just type?
lmao she WHAT
Self driving cars still won't help fix the problem if old people can't afford them
That‚Äôs hard-boiled. This is the secret weapon we‚Äôve been waiting for. You are a god-damned hero. üéñ
[NAME], someone get her a green card so she can clean rooms at the Super 8 and stop obsessing on social media. 
Nah I dont think the panthers are good enough
When you buy the dog you get a lot of training to go with it and it's usually then further trained to specifically protect the person.
Great cover of my favorite song. I loved watching you slowly giving into the temptation to rock out to the rhythm.
I'd assume that the player is on the list as the king sense losing a king is losing the game, right?
They most likely did, since they still having bank issues.
All the people who got on at canning bridge station this morning and kept pushing and shoving each other like animals.
[NAME] couldn‚Äôt get them to the playoffs. Pulling out [NAME] for him is dumb
As a Dolphins fan this hurts me
Being a jerk and believing yourself to be right or the victim creates a messy mind.
Glad to hear it‚Äôs open again, great spot. I still class climbing Coonowrin as the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever done.
Ooook, time to calm down now.
Hey, your hair looks great! As a fellow curly girl I'm just wondering what your routine looks like?
I would love it ... how does the chat thing work I‚Äôm pretty new here
Really? it's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen.
"""Talk about vaccines again and your next shot will be from my gun... of crystals bathed in essential oils"""
Deadlift and 3-lift total 100% raw federation
That‚Äôs very unfortunate for the bosses. Capitalism sure does commit genocide. Ireland. India. Indonesia. Vietnam. Iraq. Should I name more?
You just brushed off the entirety of his video and reverted back to the original argument.
Fucking awesome tournament to watch, well done WePlay, grats to Maggo. The constructed meta ain't that stale!
Cut the guy off and gave him a yes-no question. Which he exasperatedly answered. This is not the way to listen.
Maybe I‚Äôm an outlier, but I don‚Äôt find that contract to be outrageous for what the player is worth.
I'd love it, too. Might be that I've just gotten an idea for a post.
You do realise that a toilet lid doesn't make the toilet air tight, so the toxic poo ridden air you're so worried about would still escape.
In my experience I've also noticed his friends and got ditched by my girlfriend.
Yes. What do you use? Geocities?
"I believe it was the ""Master Batters."""

Yours truly, The reddit supplicant. 
State = good Anarcho-capitalism = bad Have fun getting taxed.
It‚Äôs copypasta from like 2004 lol
Sadly, it looks like there are a ton of [NAME] in this sub
Those women's marches are honestly embarrasing. Most of the people there only seem to claim to be a feminist because it's trendy.
Thank you for being the voice of reason in the calamity that is Walmart.
Is there a personal reason he wants [NAME] impeached?
Its great that redditors who bicker over different topics can come together for a laugh
You‚Äôre like not wrong but I wanted to play up the immaturity. I‚Äôll go back and edit
[NAME] - I misspelt and can‚Äôt correct it now
you seem fun!
Japan uses anime for it all, but it does often prefix it with something like kaigai. (outside of the country).

This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it!
This is the first time I've finished something so cringey. I'm dead inside, thanks. 
Yeah, I‚Äôm going to do my best to avoid a fight. She‚Äôd probably kill me. 
I live for this comment üôåüèª i just thought it was me getting older and losing touch with whats ‚Äútrendy‚Äù but am glad its equally hated
Uh, she was [NAME] girlfriend. She broke up with him with that text.
In all fairness Ive said it to men, woman, and children. Nobody is outside of my blind rage.
Which one? The November game where the Bengals almost come back or the December game where the defense scores two TDs?
Got married so I don't have to worry about it.
Oh man. I feel so bad for her, but am morbidly curious at the same time. Got more pics? 
no one loves me
I would pay money to see the security cam footage of that.
That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate you taking the time.
That's an unusual idea, I must try it out! Thank you!
i hate this
Is this a mood?
This is cute AF. For 5.00 - 10.00? That's not bad yo. Some people at fairs would pay for 25.00 for this.
holy shit that's bad, maybe the extremist right can't meme either?
...I mean, that part isn't necessarily wrong. It's Iowa...
Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
 Therapy really is the only way. It's not easy, but maybe therapy will help you learn to love yourself enough to love someone else one day. 
Your appearance doesn't magically look objectively creepy just because you're a creep. You're being stupid.
Oh man I didn‚Äôt know it was a repost but I tried trimming it after seeing on the gram.
I really like this one.
Paraphrasing [NAME], this brought warm feelings to my heart.
It‚Äôs a facepalm just for the wrong reason
Technically, going 1 forward and five backwards is still a 4 step backward defecit so they are not moving forward 
Put some respect on the name of my boy [NAME].
He needed the trophy in GTA?
So you‚Äôve never had a fwb situation and if you have it made you worthless for a real relationship to other women? Hope this goes both ways
Do the same to them with your straightness
Fuck this guy

Ugh. It makes sense why you spend so much time with him. Still please please don't marry him.
This video doesn't even show the shoes he was wearing...
Oof, yeah sorry my dude, it came across as pro-wall to me. Probably what happened with others as well.
Haha. Thank you
Because it's straight up untrue. It's a new ce idea but anyone relying on the sentiment is going to be repeatedly disappointed.
I hope you enjoy it!
... This is a stupid idea. One of the first things caught will be a wiki quote.
YES! And have some fun guests to dish with.
That's super fricking cool I love it
Wait, you don't love reading people's blog posts on Reddit?
We use that a lot in the UK too
That‚Äôs awesome! Good call :) settling my alarm now m/
I take everyone that visits me over to Lands End .. I'm a huge fan of the hike from there back to Sea Cliff!
This dude was joking. OP is retarded
I have dayz but haven‚Äôt played in years. Last I heard it‚Äôs still a broken mess lol.
I‚Äôm not much into either, but I have my share of stupid desires. I really want more mermaid tails.
That's the funniest mental image I've had in a very long time!

The Nexus 6 is my favourite phone even though its a few years old but no one knows Moto or Nexus phones so.....
Funny because I only owe 20k... I guess no one told these kids community college exists.
Right on. Thanks!
the real crime would be to not finish what we started!
Sorry for your loss. My bestfriend is turning 13 soon and I'm trying to cherish every minute we still have.
1 is the lie. I'm cheating because I remember this convo from last week.
you get an upvote for that username! I wish I was a funhammer
Hey, we have that problem too. Remember at least one number, folks. It's in your best interest in case of an emergency or jail.
This is why keep the keys for the cage out of arms reach of the cage.
Probably from all the teens that get drunk and then start trouble. But because they are dumb teenagers they end up bringing fists to a knife fight..
Should you choose to have kids, you're going to make a good parent one day.
Wonderful, [NAME] can just go ahead and quit politics right now then. (ref)
Go forth and get rated, my child. 
Not the **emotional effect**, when it's in the best interest of our country.
Great job! Hats off to you.
I love learning, but I can‚Äôt be asked.. 
That scene made me think of Arizona a little bit tbh. I think I'm missing [NAME]*
I just ate my last teva those are my favorite
Haha haha! Excellent
I feel like [NAME] was impossibly bad enough to warrant memes about him. [NAME] is just bad, boring, and too invisible to really hate.
Except the rest of the scoreboard is in blue (score and time) or white (team names). I did figure it out but certainly not straightforward
This is amazing. This is how Christmas should be.
Stick your head in a blender and leave it on for all year. Turn it off for October and half of November...then right back into it
We're going in a couple of weeks. It was easy to get her to go and she wants to
Oh, THAT. Yes I agree actually, I found that part rather malicious.
Interesting, I did not know that. Thanks for the TIL! Could you recommend any resources that discuss this further?
Also how nonchalantly he hits them, like he's swatting a mildly irritating fly
"Knew [NAME] would go for it. Again, love that fake-worry shade he throws. Just add ""biting nails"" and he could star in movies!"
Are you saying you do not want to go to bed right now?
. . . Wait a fucking second
Yeah I feel like we‚Äôd be able to do *something*, just not sure what... I find it interesting as hell though! 
That looks like before Fox even owned it, I was surprised to see it's almost been 30 years
Bet you don't even get ¬£400, you probably only started this thread for some attention 
Happy to not only have the same birthday as him, but to also have a ball he threw into the stands after the middle of the 9th inning. 
Les Collines (Never Leave You) is still a bop. I loved that song and is still awesome in 2019.
Get some colloidal silver and put that in your eye so it doesn‚Äôt get infected!!!
I freakin love this channel
[NAME] dammit I love wrestling
Im tiddly at beer oclock. Hello from taranaki new Zealand.
Of all the injustices in the world!
This makes my tummy sick.
o.o I want to be able to drop 30k on presents. [NAME]: Sounds fun.
Its almost like climate change makes hot places hotter and cold places colder. Jeez, who could have predicted that. 
This is his 2nd marriage that he has cheated in. She refuses to see how much of a snake he is.
I hope [NAME] does some more music soon
As a student in DC Universities I hope to fucking god they get rid of blackboard and replace it with canvas.
I _hate_ it when I can't get hold of a specific food I've been craving on a binge day.
No!!!!
Shame..
Ashamed of being British
The white thing high up in the yellow square is my uncle [NAME] glass eye. Wonder how it got there.
Ope, got a lil chuckle outta me there, sorry
I'm not a health threat. I'm vaccinated and have no children. Thanks again for your uninformed analysis.
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
I suppose [NAME] listens to the screams of his mother before she gets shot(?)
"""[NAME] H. MYSELF?! He's actually signing that?!"""
I just moved to the big city, you reminded me to check in my local area now, just reported 4! Thanks!
Can I start getting excited for [NAME] yet
I admit I‚Äôll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.
My brain is exploding!
I know it‚Äôs out of control!
21 year old here! I had always wondered when I would feel like an adult... according to this thread looks like it never happens
I keep telling everyone to watch it. It's such a fun movie and the directing is great.
true... good luck! You're doing the right thing.
Are you actually making all this?
No going back after switching to a safety razor. Even the most expensive blades are 10x+ cheaper than Gillette.
That‚Äôs the p-value, not the effect size. 0.4 is a long way from being a significant result.
This just looks like it‚Äôs actually from porn lol what is the original context
Except, they do.
"Doesn't matter how much experience you have, you're still delusional and most likely attracted to the ""wrong"" kinds of men"

Yeah. Sure.... Why don‚Äôt you just let us have some fun, wet towel person.
Same. I only use my controller on my pc for dark souls and other rpg games
Well with how often the VPD turns a blind eye downtown I promise you vigilante justice is coming.
I'm polish too. I love my family but I would never even consider trying to live there trying to be happy.

ROFL! Just about! Didn‚Äôt know someone‚Äôs eyes could bug out of their head like that outside of cartoons. ;-)
I'm so glad to hear that! Good luck rebuilding yourself.
[NAME] ruined religion. It‚Äôs the only good thing they‚Äôve done.

That's like if she went up to your car and removed your bumper stickers because she doesn't want them in her pictures.

how sad you feel about this makes me sadder than the actual story lol. you sound like a really kind person.
Many of them are actively being courted and convinced by People's Vote activists. You just actively avoid acknowledging that fact.
Malhama Tactical has been exposed as a sham FYI

Idk for fun?
FYI she‚Äôs probably cheating on someone, so didn‚Äôt want to post pics. 
He would say Shut up about the sun I don‚Äôt think he likes space.
Nostalgia is the best high. You get to enjoy what you liked with several cool new perspectives.
You shouldn't see a lot of lightspamming conquerors, because lightspamming as a conqueror is just begging for a parry.
People keep giving serious arguments but you keep replying ‚Äúbut mah happiness‚Äù Not worth it to lose time arguing with the likes of you
Oh no, not what I meant at all! Sorry for the confusion :O
Insurance covers stupidity, so maybe they'd cover it? 
Am I confusing you with someone? I thought you had posted that you liked older women.

You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
Oh, it's thor
Right? It‚Äôs not like her family seems like they wouldn‚Äôt have helped with her son.
I have scars, but they‚Äôre not deliberately self-inflicted. I am just a massive klutz. 
A video that makes me happy
Gungrabbers? You act like they're busting in your door and taking your guns. No one is forcing you to do this.
You're welcome!
Omfg. I meant [NAME]
"""I refuse to argue with anyone born before 1980: They don't even know how to rotate PDFs"" That is exactly how this stupid argument sounds"

The only term I really use is ‚Äúsis‚Äù for effect, imo referring to a guy as ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù is a little weird to me 
Your dog is so brave ‚ù§Ô∏è
How do people make this up and expect their story to hold up
Are you invited to get birthday tho?
I like they think that it‚Äôs bad that we are thinking about the fucking POTUS. It‚Äôs almost like his actions effect us all
In our military at the time you could pay out at any point. They really only wanted people who wanted to be there.
That's the kind of problem a physical therapist is more qualified to handle. Good luck

I am pleased to report that my 5 win streak was broken.
"Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
Yikes. I admire your patience

Thanks man, I managed to feel better by letting loose with some music - definitely a *much* better way to pull out of a dive. 
Peacefully, obviously. Let's not get crazy, this is still Canada.

Oh come on, can you just enjoy the damn picture?
Fair enough.
Yeah I've become extremely cynical since I started making these sorts of realizations.

They're just excited! About everything!! It's the best when people do this in professional emails, too!!! 
This looks so damn cool! I‚Äôd love a shirt like this!
Tell her to stop eating shit and start using mouthwash.
Spiritual shorthand. You nailed it. That term says it all. They've become so practiced in it that it has become meaningless.
I'm not saying your analysis is wrong or not based on evidence, just that the data it generates is not useful. 
You ain't wrong
To piss people off probably
So using your figures here we make ¬£12 billion in tax from the EU company's selling in to the uk. We save a further ¬£9billion on fees to the EU
The age of consent is 16 in Massachusetts. Unless they‚Äôre sending nude pictures he‚Äôs not doing anything illegal.

I love when people make proclamations without backing any of it up with examples or proof.
It‚Äôs a soulless facsimile of what made B movies actually fun.

Omg l live for [NAME] stirring the pot!!
It‚Äôs actually thoroughly thought through. Thanks for the comment. It‚Äôs just evidently not for you.

[NAME] looks wayyyyyy happier to be there than he did at the Columbus press conference last week.
Some sort of f***ery is going on here.
hmm today i will listen to death and destruction
None that's why I asked. Glad to see your doing something and not just wishing or whining as that wont make it happen
I wish that were a thing üôÑ
The god awful CGI is honestly entertainment enough!
I'll miss the podcast
if they‚Äôre available for questioning then you‚Äôre a shitty kidnapper. -3/5 stars
Reported again :)
You'll find a few down South, too. No surprise.
When an article implies something rather than stating it explicitly, it's almost always to create a better headline.
There is no true 0 speed because it is relative to an object your speed.
You shot well. UVA's defense wasn't that bad that game in all honesty. People underestimate the amount of luck involved in basketball, bottom line. 
Thank you, next
Clearly it's all the Big Pharma in the Monsanto‚Ñ¢. I heard at least two of those kids had three Monsantos‚Ñ¢, EACH! 
me too it really b like that sometimes
At least the crack makes it look cool eh. Happy new year :)
So excited for this!! Thanks to all who have worked so hard to put this together <3
Yeah, just wanted to do it myself. Not gonna though, after the concerted demoralization from commenters. 
Yeah who knows how many indictments [NAME] is gonna rack up retroactively? It could be hundreds! /s
The reaction is incredible. I‚Äôm quite certain it‚Äôs satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. 
Also likely selling stolen goods too lol
Cool. Would be happy to know if this worked out for you. I had wasted a bunch of time like you did and was getting frustrated.
Oh lol. Thanks for the clarification. I just thought that‚Äôs the texture of the tongue.
I don't think they really learn so much as they relax and get more comfortable.
[NAME] took the pupils
I'd trust someone who is bound by regulation over [NAME] from Essex who blames immigrants cos he was fired for sleeping on the job
But thats a few hours ahead!
Thank you, I couldn‚Äôt figure out what he was trying to say!
BUT IT'S HER TURN! /s
A jerk to *us* because we didn't get to see either of them get face-pied. XD
I have but she wont listen.
GOAT FLAP. Thank you! I am in the middle of hormones right now.
He‚Äôs a way worse version of [NAME]. I don‚Äôt think anyone is putting him in their top 15 besides Bears fans.
Thank you noodle, very cool!
[NAME] is such a disgusting champ to play against ....
Wait, this is an actual music video you're describing, and not like... a Family Guy bit?
Shut up you shill /s
Sorry to hear about that and hope you have moved on.
[NAME] thinks the carbon tax is as bad as Holodmor. He is totally unhinged and shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously.
[NAME]. She's always so busy. I'm glad she finally got to relax....
She sucks but you don‚Äôt sound much better
Love the idea of these birds showing up during family gatherings and puking up trinkets
I'm in Australia, so idk if there's really anything I can do.
Thanks for reminding me of her response video, that was gold
But it's such a lovely place!!! I might need help...
Very sad news for the man. Widespread travel disruption is expected for the evening commute
U R quite welcome buddy. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.
I recognized a word!
the longest week (2014) I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs still available but it was pretty good romantic comedy
Oh, I see. 
Hey don't insult troglodytes like that. I'm sure they would have wanted vaccines
Please be careful with pain relievers man, I'm really sorry.
I interview applicants and respect people that ask about work life balance and harassment policy... are applicants afraid of asking these questions?
tHiS iS wHY TruMP wiLL wiN!!!!!1!1
i mean, never listened to zepellin much, not even acdc, i didnt know acdc suck
The real joke is always in the comments.
That‚Äôs so cute!
As I‚Äôve said in other comments, the increase in the cost of carbon makes it regressive. The rebates make them progressive.
Probably fake. In most situations Siri will tend to avoid words like penis and hope you're saying pianist
[NAME] claims to have only loved [NAME].
How can someone be so stupid to post that online, let alone publicly do that
Wholesome and hilarious! Good job OP.
Flattened odds make it not matter nearly as much
Think there's a very good chance [NAME] gets hurt and we see [NAME] at SS and [NAME] at 2B every day.
Unfollowed at least?
This also made me Smile, thank you
Well I'm trying to improve, man 
Best of luck to you too. sorry to hear that. Here's to No contact!!
Oh you got me. Good one.
This is almost worse than Santa Con. Can we get millenials to destroy this please.
We love you [NAME]
What? The non-vegan burger air particles have clearly infiltrated the once-pure cardboard. It is absolutely NOT vegan >:(
Family first, this ain't no stranger trying to profit. This is blood. 
There is no such thing as 'incel worldview'. Youve been indoctrinated by other subs, most likely [NAME]. Admit that you're wrong and move on.
Correct, there is no such law that obligates a woman to make her body available to gestate a fetus for someone else's convenience or amusement.
As if the sweet release of death is *worse* than getting stuck behind some idiot
Have them put out a Linux client and I'll be happy to give them a try.
No helmet + no shoes + no skill + no sense = exactly what happened
Hi I'm not police where is your business and what is your full name thank you
He takes so much abuse...and i appreciate it's him and not butcher or severson tight now.
I don't really understand what you mean üò© haha Can you explain please?
She does it again in last nights episode, it‚Äôs so shady!!
It was [NAME] thank you very much, than I'd go to wumpscut. 
I wish you luck anyway lmao, and don't think so down of yourself, i believe you'll do great 
Possible maybe, not at all plausible.
Ive always wanted someone to tell me how beautiful my protein powder looks.
Looks good!
I would just beat up someone I really hate, my brother.
Why do some people use tbh after everything
> Greece and Turkey to go bananas. Would you be willing to explain, please?
This is so true.
Can Dr. [NAME] confirm this? Edit: Doesn't matter. T H I C C D O N is actually zaddy af.
"He looks great in ""Ideal Home""."
I honestly have no clue but I‚Äôd also love to have one of those
Happy birthday [NAME] !
what a cute outfit omg
*NOW* you understand jokes.
Ignorance is unfortunately a part of mankind. We are still so Un-evolved
Clouds aren‚Äôt pale they‚Äôre translucent but ok üëåüèΩ
She won‚Äôt lose fans. If anything she‚Äôll introduce her fans to this sound and give them a reason to love it.
No, thats just the glare from the sun
The supplement industry is another scam. Multi billion dollar industry. Stop wasting your money on GNC prework out drinks and go straight to the real source.
Hi [NAME]. Nice to meet you, I'm promet. 
I need a thick 10 inches too, thank you. 
None at all. I dont like kids and dont want them. I got a vasectomy and it's a done deal. Zero regrets
Whoa! Very impressive. One of the better photos of Brisbane I've seen in a while.
I upvoted, even though phrasing make this sentence debatable.
Oh whoops, I misread the original comment
for Inter fans because THEIR BEST PLAYER IS COMING TO CHELSEA THIS WINTER
Poor [NAME] she just broke her back
THANK YOU [NAME]
You still haven't shown any evidence of racism outside your own mind.
Hey cool! I'm a cow. I love milk. Drink a litre a day at least. Love me some moo juice.
Are you still sitting in the car right now?

Magic are a good team. They battle every game
Can you believe it girls? [NAME]: 9 months ago I was in jail and now I'm a cabaret star
And I‚Äôm just sitting here wishing my cat would come at least sit by me.
where you going /u/Nerdinater ? if ya dont mind me asking
Discuss equality, be labeled troll. Good bye. I am so disappointed. In humanity.
It's delicate, so it's clear for those flesh toned jeggings [NAME].
Lets get it ooooonnn
"FUCK OFF THAT""S A PEN"
I'm pretty sure the armor still shows on the person after you kill them even if it is broken.
Because it's like she's a child, though it would be weird to explain it right then.
No love for [NAME]. Team MVP is [NAME] but [NAME] deserves the offensive MVP he was a game changer when healthy and was electric.
I can do this, but after the last one, I fall to the floor and vomit on myself
You are grieving a hard loss, and might benefit from some grief therapy.
> Wonder why centrism was basically nonexistent like a decade ago. Moderates existed even before that, so not really
I'm so glad the Ontario government sold off that money pit. /s
Proud of you!
BUT WHY IS THE FELLOW HUMAN SHOUTING?
I feel bad for my kids who will never get to see [NAME] play... [NAME] on the other hand...
Rip I guess.... Hope op does that Also happy cake day!
Don't feed the troll
No it's not >:(
Love the laugh at the end
Damn, u right. 
And those are countries ruled according to [RELIGION] principles?
thank you so much we do in fact [NAME]
I think the drug site is supposed to help solve the overdose problem, not the housing problem.
And, taken word for word, it cannot be legally binding in Canada because it is an unconstitutional document. 
LOL I work at HPE and I was about to share this with our new hub director...glad I watched the last 2 seconds.
Guess we don't need to be afraid of hell, then, 'cause we can easily get out.
I don't want *my* kids exposed to that information. They might get curious and want to try it themselves!
Sure! :D Thanks for requesting ^^
Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.
Mine too!! Always thought it was dyed from wearing mascara, but I haven't worn any in a while
It did! Good luck on yours!! -[NAME]
You could be nonbinary?
i cant believe they went after lady [NAME] who has been compared to [NAME]
I've had 1, 2, and 4 said to me. I'm completely done at this point.
That's quite a lot worse tbh
That‚Äôs awesome news! Welcome to the family!
I‚Äôm sorry. But, keep your respectability politics to yourself
"Siri ""calling mom would be sad"""
Mine is Woman by [NAME] üòÇ I get the chills when I hear that song. Maybe it is a hymn?
Oh thanks, ~~[NAME]~~ Mitt. We all know you won‚Äôt provide meaningful opposition to [NAME].
No one has asked yet. So...how?!
I'm here for youüòÑüòú
Omg I thought you were paraphrasing. I'm so happy that those were the exact words they said.
r/ThirdSentenceHappy My eyes swelled with tears as I opened the door and watched all 8 puppies, overcome with joy, as they were reunited with their Mother.
Dozens. My favorite scene is the tribe bringing dude back from the dead. CHIIIIIKA. CHIIIIIKA. CHIIIIIKA. CHIIIIIKA.
Teachers today complain, but zero tolerance does prevent the whole bull-whip/beat-to-death scenarios.
Queen coming for that 2nd week!
This guy reddits!
Yes!!!!! THIS!!
‚ÄúThere it is!- look for somewhere to park!‚Äù -ravers upon seeing the bridge every weekend in the 90‚Äôs RIP that bridge
Didn't find it believable even from the start
Please get your soy away from me, i‚Äôm allergic.
Watch [NAME] left arm and hand as he's on the floor. Scary.
Thanks so much, appreciate it. She actually wanted to read CES letter with me tonight, we really about a 1/3. Will post update later on.
He‚Äôs not anti-healthcare, and pretty much every hospital is government subsidized. 
This guy gets it (and feels it as well... Sorry brother)
Look everyone it's that boy that laughs at everybody! Let's laugh at him!
The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
Congratulations, and Happy New Year! May it be as sexy and as prosperous as you could wish for. 
Interesting. Can you give some examples?
Exactly, or they thought he was saying it jokingly. The delusion these men live with continues to amaze me
You [NAME] did not make us look good at all.
Just out of curiosity, what happened with the big dog?
It's not healthy though. It's processed. Lol, I see what you did there. Pun intended?
I never knew that existed. I'm bloody dying right now üòÇ
He just can't deal with the fact that he finds you hot.
The inventor of the joke came up with it during the [NAME] administration.
Never once is it implied that the birds can sense crazy people.
Dogs , unconditional love 
I see what u did there!
I'm 27 and I want to live in a society that shuts down at 8pm!
That's ok I get it exactly you're ok with me
This looks like don't hug me I'm scared
"...if there is a way to edit this to ""original content"" I'd love some coaching on that. Thanks folks! "
Columbus really gets away with quite a lot of interference.
What exactly was exposed? Are you just saying things to feel like you‚Äôve achieved something?
[NAME] is my 2nd favorite QB after [NAME]. Very high ceiling and [NAME] always seems to get the best out of his QBs
Alright. Why is it possible for us to make fun of the almighty [NAME]?
Hears hoping, best of luck
ehhhh I don't think so. iirc [NAME] was responsible for that Russian embargo and he's the reason why AKs are so expensive now.
Or you could literally walk down amy street and see any ugly guy with a girl..
[NAME] is actually only 1 day older than [NAME]
Looks like a hover hand for a few frames.
Truth never changes. Maybe it's questionable to you, but... 
Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems.
It definitely doesn't work if you give up.
Happens to me sometimes too in certain scenarios. Its frustrating especially when you're banking on it deflecting something.
"He had to say, ""But alas"" which makes this soo funny."
Nah. Been over it pretty much since [NAME] said the Vikings did it too. Pretty hard to be mad when we were just as guilty.
you dont have to sign up for anything, just literally paste the output of the script.
[NAME] earned it I think. He was godlike at world's. But [NAME] is the absolute worst S+ on this list.
My two favorite things, The Office and The Show. combined in one reference. Life is good.
This is what nepotism looks like, folks.
"Super petty. The story makes you sound pretty jealous and controlling, as well. Especially the ""SJW"" line... It sounds like a 16-year-old incel. "
OMG this sub is gonna be my saving grace for the rest of the year. Thank you so much!!
So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
Too bad no crossprog with PS4 thanks to Sony, though I heard gamedevs are trying to talk it out with them
The lead designer, not the producer :)
The picture in the thumbnail looks like the kids in the maga hat that fucked with the native [NAME]
You're a mean person.
Correct them. It‚Äôs best to let them know the real you right from the beginning rather than later.
This is a new level of entitlement. THE BATHROOM IS OUT OF ORDER! What makes you so entitled to use an OUT OF ORDER bathroom!
So hit Seek and Indeed.
Agree with everything here. Going to med school abroad will always put you at a disadvantage if you want to practice in the states
[NAME] has personal experience with people turning into remorseless killers. What he thinks of walkers is immaterial.
I'm glad for that. Once that check comes in, I only have about $3000 to work with.
I did not downvote Mate :) In fact I just gave you two upvotes :) Cheers :)
Not sure about the dates off the top of my head, but Feits is so full of shit that theres a good chance he just made this up.
This is so wildly specific I love it
I also thought he was a she at first. Lol
Great reply as usual
Losing my Origin account? Oh no, how else will I play thousands of other non-shitty EA games now?
This is literally why women think men CANNOT be raped.
Murder is $3 million, but genocide is only $25 million. Everyone after 8 is free! What a deal!!
The Ethical code of conduct. However it's subjective in many instances. But its based on impairment
Sounds like he's lying to you both. You probably would have a lot of heart ache if you continue to be involved with this one.
Oof this hits home
For [NAME] sake, they used OFFICIAL ones , my god. Fucking animals.
So upset by the email lady after all these years. Get help.
Thanks I will consider that :)
I‚Äôm the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party
Good luck and my thoughts are with you.
I‚Äôd love a new Governor to do it. [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] are all talented orators.
Trains were literally travelling the wrong direction that day
I really love how this team responds to injuries
you have to admit- it's kind of exhilirating to know that we are part of the pinnacle of human evolution.
PHX at home? Should be a cakewalk, right guys?
You can see they actually blocked them since the last message is green. That is so messed up.
I have mixed feelings about discovering aliens that are now 1.5 billion years more advanced than us.
Gone Girl 2 looks like it's gonna be great.
Everyone can tell when dudes do a combover and yet many guys do them
I think only Germany would have this kind of organization skills. Source: Know 2 Germans. Am therefore expert.
That logic doesn't work. Porn stars make movies knowing they are going to be seen, but it is still objectification. 
Black people still get shot unarmed. Comparing suffering is stupid and pointless.
It was pretty cool seeing him play all the horrible games based off his childhood stardom on AVGN‚Äôs YouTube channel. Fucking [NAME].... Bane of my childhood.
I love when the subreddit shows [NAME] some love! We have so many people that keep an ear to the ground for quality [NAME] content.
I actually choose to teach an extra class so I can avoid lunch duty. I hate it.
It's also not worth the costs because most of the time people are being petty don't actually have a claim to make.
It's a photograph with one of our greatest ever defender and captain. What's your problem?
Love the Cafe Zoetrope, such a charming place. Beautiful building too.
How did you get access to PCTC?
I have adhd whats so bad about it?
No refund for services rendered.
I figured, just thought I‚Äôd throw it out there. Love you :)
You must make a killing as a Dublin landlord. That apartment will be rented 24/7
Really curious to know how you know what people are going to think in 500 years, you ass.
Stay strong.
Disgusting!!! Where were the adults? The adults probably felt proud of their sons. Fucken toxic culture
Thank you! I still cant believe someone could be so selfish and awful and deliberately try to ruin Christmas for kids. So awful.
NINE NINE!!!
Thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è
Congratulations on the low quality come back. Hopefully one day you can go to therapy to work on your resentment to bartenders. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Stupid sexy squidward
They‚Äôre trying to escape the crushing oppression of gender roles. It‚Äôs not a fun sexy fetish to them the way it is to TiMs.
Tour child is a genius, that would be awesome
You realize everyone sees you REEEEEEing all over the place right? You can act nonchalant all you want but obviously youre one salty sea dog
Lol the guy in white who just leans back and looks away when he gets [NAME] ass in his face
When you've been to 9 in the past 20 years its kinda hard to stiil get excited . Its our week 17.
Real nice guys are just kind people.
I think it was sponsored by rent but musical theatre themed
[NAME] face looks so cute here. What happened. Too many fillers ?
Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.
If anything [NAME] has shown he can do a lot with very little. The Bucs are just a fun team to watch
Its just coming out now...
I think this is a normal human emotion that a lot of people can relate to.
What the heck? $3 a month for 30 texts? That's ridiculous.
I wonder how many didn't get the joke
In case anyone is wondering.. the money was a 20$ tip. Edit: 200$. I‚Äôve been corrected.
Right, we don't know for certain. It was just what I've heard. We'll have to wait until we can test it.
Thanks bud!
Never seen somebody project so hard in my LIFE Also [NAME] @ them directly quoting lines from the article in the comments Gives me r/iamverysmart vibes
You know, unless you die.
When she drilled into the table [NAME] didn‚Äôt even know they were sleeping together. Her complaint should‚Äôve been filed with Arizona.
Bestest boi.
Haha look at that poor person slime, can‚Äôt even afford the wire hahaha
Considering the mass amount of seasonals they hired this year I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
No worries! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :)
How to instantly look 20 years younger!
Ahh didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!
Lol! Too funny. Mine are depressed, they gave up. :(
I‚Äôm Waiting for Dr [NAME] to bring back Celebrity Rehab so her and [NAME] can be on it.
Why does that matter?
Great [NAME], love Oasis, saw this in theaters when I had the chance.
Yes I really miss his streams...the ONLY reason I chose adc as my main role was because of how chill chaox was.
Sweet [NAME]. Yes. He. We are men. We are married. Stare if you want.
I moved from the midwest to AK about 6 months ago. Loving the Mat- Su winter compared to the midwest. DO NOT miss the wind at all.
Ya ikr. I‚Äôm tired and idk how to take what‚Äôs goin on.
This has absolutely nothing to do with ABCDs.
Dude i wish you the best. I had one and it had been removed though surgery about 5 years ago. The best of luck
Someone that can check your dash and aa your jump is frightening.
Plus [NAME] has won before. [NAME] is a perennial loser. All he has ever done is played on teams that were the worst in the NHL.
Wow, that's incredible. I love the 4 quadrants idea! But the name of the business is so misleading...
It's amazing how people will tell you not to go for something, but then are the same ones who can't go 2 minutes without it.
Lmao. Dude, I was thinking the exact same thing. 
We aren't 4th anymore since our goal difference was just destroyed. He's not going to be sacked yet but losing to Huddersfield would be inexcusable
"I'm guessing ""Corporate Stooge"" didn't focus group well."
Such a nasty woman
Yeah I'm actually pretty surprised that's not a thing yet, there's gotta be a lot of people working on it. 
Long dead meme dude
They got rid
Calling Israel evil for their policies is anti Semitism? What a joke.
I just read this the other day for the first time since I was a kid. What an influential book.
Do you not see the blatant hypocrisy of this post?
"you dare diss mini-me like that huh [NAME] gonna come and shoot you with his ""laser beam"""
Of course this is the type of dude to CC a .45 caliber.
"If she is hot and has nice shoes...""I like your shoes."" "
Until he goes back to school on Tuesday and all his friends are SO RELIEVED that he‚Äôs back safely.
Oh my. That will show them
"I read it as ""so long suckers"". That's how those words translated in my mind.."
Guess there is no benefit for my next car to be any safer considering I haven‚Äôt died in my old one then...
Beast milk. My favourite!
The fact that they didn't double up on gronk on any key plays tells me they weren't playing against NE strength.
I am and have dealt with the consequences, hence my amazing son. Like I said before, hopefully you don't procreate.
I was using story of the tower of Babel to say that from a [RELIGION] side people would all have the same skin colour anyway
Thank you kindly :)
Ugh. Sounds awful. I‚Äôm sorry :(
GH is slow compared to DD. Worked 4 hour block on GH and got 0 orders. Turn on DD and get an order instantly.
Is it weird that I read this with Papa [NAME] voice
"There were TWO of those ""catches"" that hit the ground... ugh."
[NAME] got bank...he's paying people to count his cash. He's doing fine
Why is neighbour spelt incorrectly?
Self confidence I think and the fact that I‚Äôm scared if I do give all of myself to some that they won‚Äôt reciprocate.
His whole point is that he doesn't have to give a damn about others or how they feel.
Damn this is experience talking.
[NAME] being 50-33 against winning teams kinda suggests it wouldn't matter that much if their division were better. Maybe have gone to 7 superbowls instead of 8.
Friend of the younger sister of girl who was killed. She told me it was a bad acid trip. Very sad, family is holding a vigil tomorrow night. 
Yup if you‚Äôre ahead and just want to spam actives I enjoy it with an upgraded cursed ankh to really hurt healing based teams
This counts as a problem if you have that many in one day or something
It gives me a weird feeling as someone not named [NAME]. It's a very heeby jeeby inducing phrase.
So I'm not ugly I'm hideous
Considering how beautiful every single person is, there is far too much ugliness on Earth. 
Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch
>Eat more salad Might I also suggest some vegetables too. You'll feel infinitely better
You are so pretty.
Apologies but what movie is this from?
I just wanted to say how honorable you are, r/niceguys
His other book was interesting, The Age of EM
Thank you. I have been watching a lot of porn lately and jerking off more and i think that helps. How are you doing?
I don't understand the title.
Wasn't north and south Dakota one state at some point? Are they putting aside they're difference and getting back together?
I walked 500 miles and then I walked 500 more, you can‚Äôt relate to my pain üò§
That‚Äôs what makes this so sweet! Blackmailers are scum. This was satisfying to read. You‚Äôre a savage, OP. Well done! 
[NAME] boxing gym in Ross is super inviting to everyone! It's a legit boxing club that is also friendly to folks just looking for a workout.
Flour and salt in Fairfield
I love converts. They willingly throw away their freedom for a prison cell. So cute
Hey man, if you need the Chiefs to lose to bring you any sort of pleasure I get it. But at least be classy about it! 
You really don't comprehend anything my man, now do you? Goodness gracious the amount of stupidity. 
I like flirting so this is what I enjoy doing, plus ordinary flirting is outcome independent. Direct approach is outcome dependent. Either way it's all part of the fun!
Barely as in just this year
being reminded of that blessed image now makes me hope they won't do the whole no bipod on your back thing rip my homie franku
Glad you had fun!! Did you all, ya'know? Did you all make plans to see each other again soon?
Oh look another shit call
Oh, I think I misread it somewhere. Good news then! Hope [NAME] will use him next season. L
This is good for people who pilots as well and rely on Tablets or phones for mapping
its like waze but for people in debt
[NAME] is a turd, but I actually believe him here. I'd be stunned if he didn't have a bigger offer than what [NAME] reported.
Furries would love this
I am interested if still available. This would be way more fun then my smith center season!
not sure I agree. whispers of madness can set up [NAME] signature and being card draw is always useful in the first lane.
I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'.
I'm American and only speak English and didn't get that pun either...
Fam, I didn't have him kill [NAME] so I can do it next episode
I just have a controller on my desk that I turn on when I fly. I've always hated mouse flying.
Wow so you've been around your entire country and spoken to every single person about traffic accidents? So cool.
i will downvoted u into oblivion!!!!!!
BOOP! Go Stars!
It's funny how he even has the same attitude in both shows.
Because we didnt have two top 5 players on the team so the bench needed to be great
How are they gatekeeping here? There's zero claims being made. They're just standing by a sign.
the trend was that i didn't really like any of them. Turns out i was just desperate.
Most police departments have something similar, and it's the name.of the big LEO sub.
[NAME]. Haha r u [NAME]??
Thank you!!! /s
And todsy the crips are up 3 points narrowly beating out the bloods who only rose 2.5.
That day was incredible.
Not if it's at the direction of the front office. Which is the only reason it would happen. Use your head.
Watching girly tv shows. Stuff like gossip girl, pretty little liars, and gilmore girls are all a guilty pleasure
I love this movie! One of my favorite little touches is the music [NAME] character is listening to
‚ÄúThe weird thing is she‚Äôs got a tattoo of our company on her back...‚Äù lmfao
According to [NAME] there was no contact.
He has a youtube: Great watch.
Glad someone appreciates it! This was a lot of work.
Watching now. Oh wow we both didn't realize how much we hated this guy. This is one of the most quotable episodes by far.
But one-third jokey, one-third pissed and one-third dead serious just doesnt have the same ring does it?
*me three pls*
Removed and warned. R1
Those little whippersnappers are always generation-gapping us üòÇ
I'm curious how he does in the counties you mentioned. The primary might end up being super close, but you know more than I do.
Yeah nice one dude
I had a nightmare about something similar, the combination of high walls and water is truly scary
Tried so hard and got so far, in the end it doesnt even matter
I wish it was only -25. -45 where i am.
Okie, I did saw the video. To me it is a very bad Impersonification of [NAME]. I type like her?.....mmmmmmm..... okie.... 
/u/flight2-0-9er and I have been having a conversation about it
This question is kind of funny because it‚Äôs one of the main points of argument between the sides...
If that's their response ask them whether they would go down to the street to cruise for johns if the cam work dried up I'm thinking probably not.
That must have bean awesome to find those
"My first thought was, ""What is a [NAME]?"" Then I realized I was being dumb."
Love both sports, but this is what annoys me about Boxing when compared to MMA. If this was the UFC this fight would have happened years ago
Ugh. That was not information anyone needed...
I love this, if I ever get the chance to travel to California I am hitting these spots!
Maybe one day but I am very cultured*
trUmP iS pRo guN
>You can't do anything about it now, and nobody cares. Hundreds of thousands would disagree with you.
It‚Äôs neither. It‚Äôs an acrostic, lol.
After hearing weights drop - I can't imagine they're that good for the floor....
Because it's fun?
Arsenal FC the retirement home... No thanks [NAME]
Well he gets an A+ for fackin over the people!
If one day I have daughters, I want them to be so badass that these kids! Nice to see them enjoying metal! 
Oh, I like this! Where‚Äôd you get it?
Good luck and wear condom
They look pretty good down there.
Oooh, edgy!
If you don't like it, you didn't have to comment. Just let people be happy.
Me and the hubby watch every friday. Lol
Hopefully created a monster. Also, I killed the morning at work.
Lol it's a public sidewalk, I wouldn't call it their set 
I'm elated to hear that ü§ó
can't help but notice his team also gave up 66 points against ... Baker Mayfield
It doesn't, really.
Don't be so damn lazy, just type NEW YEAR'S EVE! I suppose you caled it Y2K also. - I'm so disappointed in you.
Came here for this. Thanks for representing
It's disturbing that you even have to ask that.
Oh, cool. That‚Äôs the TF all the little kids like nowadays.
What‚Äôs it like to comment on things without bothering to read the context?
What the fork?
I'm sorry I like to actually spell things out
That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
Didn't the Mets have a .909 win percentage at one point? ^^^^/s
Ha! Had to go back and look. Pens.... I was seriously wondering wtf this was, a giant penis-shaped gummy bear?!
Oh Yes. She says to me: now we can plot world domination together. I say back: and we'll never get around to it
If I only knew then what I do now.
Wow, I'm glad he's okay.
So incredibly sweet!
The hairs at the back of your neck; the butterflies in your stomach....
Thanks for the info! I will definitely try my hardest now that I know what to do. I really appreciate your help.
"He's tall. 6' 6""!!!!"
Is it weird that I was practically drooling while watching this
Wow! Congratulations on taking your sex life back! Nice to wake up and see such positivity.
It happened so fast I didn't even have time to be scared.
Wear a hoody?
Whoa I actually remember this. Wait shit does that mean I‚Äôm old
Ty. I confessed and they are being very nice to me. My kids are safe and me going to therapy is a plus now.
Sorry for late reply Rosetta is an actual name, it is different than Noctis, Rosetta doesn't hit you like a cricket bat when you hear it.
Yaaaaaas! Also, your username is awesome.
My god, what is WRONG with people? So glad you‚Äôre okay, OP!!
I miss [NAME]
There are explanations below somewhere
But both lost, whereas moderate Sinema won. Its important because without Arizona there is no real path to Senate majority in 2020.
That's disgusting. Apt.
[NAME] needs a rework, they could even use Doomfist as the excuse.
Damn millennials and their extremely frugal avocado toast habits! Also Damn millennials and their enormously extravagant avocado toast habits!
Because paychecks are more important than lives...
Undying thirst for power: Camela Harass.
Is this my Beetlejuice moment?
shut up, [NAME]!
Your comments have been removed. This is a community for support. Repeat violation will result in a ban. Thank you for understanding.
Bro. You think roads and infrastructure wouldnt be built if it wasn‚Äôt for the government? My sentiment still stands. I pity you.
[NAME] just a beast.
Ok now that was epic!
And yet only has 16k karma.
Actually I love cooking and good burgers but if I don't love **you**, you'll have to pay me to make one.
Will come back rich and driving his goddamn Bentley
- [NAME]
agreed, I am in a suburb, a HOA.....I love it here.
Thank you for sharing!
I have, but like I said, I can see women that can‚Äôt find love existing, just not in the same numbers as men
Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.
Also, AAA
Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
Alas, Windows, so I'll go a-hunting. Thanks for the info, though!
As long as I can see my abs in the morning without trying too hard. Once I lose them, it's time to cut
[NAME]!!
gotta love my s-tier talking to people anxiety haha wait no i don't üòé
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss bro ‚ù§Ô∏è
They were clearly ready for it. [NAME] is in [NAME] head.
agreed. excited to see how this team looks on opening day.
What was that behind the back nonsense, criminy. TO THE BENCH
Of course, us first borns gotta stick together. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't think I've ever seen that flag flying in this city, we mostly just have the provincial flag and the Canada flag
I like hearing about these positive encounters.
They say water feels like concrete if you hit it hard enough.....
Thanks, this really helps!
I really liked his answer to the QB success question. The Tebow part was also unintentionally hilarious.
Guilty :( I was ready to cry and everything >:(
You're right, but you forgot to mention they are registered [NAME]
I honestly would start at the beginning. Most things are still funny because you remember the events they make fun of.
Print outs?!?!?! You tree killing monster!!!!
Somebody Knows Something Up and Vanished Serial This American Life
The one fucking thing my home town has contributed besides alcoholics and [NAME] and its a fucking backwards feminist horseshit theory.
> since their shorter you has more significant impact My shorter me has more impact? Wut? Genuinely confused here about what this means
I love that fray. I wonder how he got it.
[NAME] is the type of point guard the Magic need. Efficient scorer, fast slasher, and great court vision.
Right now I‚Äôd have to say [NAME] new restaurant UB Preserve is my favorite place to eat. So good.
Needs to justify her position with her world-class counter negotiation skills...
So... For me it changed earlier yesterday... Maybe it's a location/language thing
Yep, they‚Äôre women‚Äôs shoes!!
Congrats! That could not have been an easy step to take, so I'm so happy it's been a positive experience.
What? /s
No, but it diverts resources from the art team, and prevents them from making content which would have been better recieved by the already low playerbase!
Glad I took the 1st half spread
You used the correct term. Good job.
Hello!!
What happened? Did something set you off? THough sometimes we can have good days and bad days, don't let it offset the progress you've made
I wonder if the school closures with MLK holiday reduce the priority to plow ...
I've been watching a lot of mavs games, I don't think we want [NAME]...
Tie em up and shoot em in the head, gets a real bad guy vibe flowing lol
[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure.
"""Yeah but they're not violating *my* rights so it's okay"""
[NAME] is going to love her!
Sneaky ass ESPN changing their app so I almost accidentally purchase ESPN+ for the low price of 4.99 a month.
It may get you pregnant so just make sure you eat all her birth control before hand.
I‚Äôd rather give up masturbation. No time for it anyway when I work.
Can‚Äôt believe [NAME] era is coming to an end... feels like yesterday I saw his 1st win against the cowboys with tiki breaking the rushing record.
The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day
You cant post that without proof
I did not know that. Thanks!
[NAME] bless your soul. Please keep us updated. HORRAY!
I'm late to the party but she looks like she could get up!!
Idk if I skimmed over it 3 times or what, it doesn't say why he did it. But I guess we'll never know?
Thank you! I was hoping somebody wpuld post that video since I couldnt think of what to search for.
[NAME] is timeless, so I think both can be true at once. We have been saved, are being saved, and will be saved.
Omg the etsy side hustle. I have time to do that, and it fulfills me so much
Former [NAME]? I've been scared already by [NAME] who were former d-line
I'm mostly impressed that you can get to work from West Seattle in 20 minutes by car.
> Locking someone in a cage is 100% incompatible with a world where all violence not commited in self defense is immoral. Morals are subjective
Yup ^ If it isn‚Äôt working now, it won‚Äôt work later. He needs to grow up, and you need to move on!
You need to clasp your hands on top of a book to get rid of depression? Thanks grandma
Lmao god damn
I‚Äôm not. Do your research.
Anything other than harassing motorists or worse, pretty simple.
That‚Äôs what I ended up doing lol
Needs more jpeg. :)
Butterfly is cute... it‚Äôs the dreds that are gross
We will pray for your conversion and for those who misspoke for the church. Keep at it. The fact that you‚Äôre here means something wonderful.
I don‚Äôt think anyone on this show has ever joined a sport for exercise. [NAME] is awesome!!!
Then they'll have to get a ticket with a code of it from the counter person.
You‚Äôre better off going to University
What happened to your previous account?
What is scary?
I thought I was done enjoying the Saints loss but this brought me right back. Great find!
WE LIKE SPORTZ AND WE DON‚ÄôT CARE WHO KNOWS
My aunt lost a ton of weight by eating a huge bowl of lettuce with a very light dressing and tasty veggies.
#[NAME] camp is dying, price must be dropping now that NYY are out
Never heard of anything other than brain freeze. Are the cheese heads moving south?
Can't wait to see the corporate oligarchs that are *lucky* enough to *randomly* get picked.
I‚Äôve never heard of their football team, must be fake news /s
Oh baby a triple!
Check out my m√©m√©s. (That word is from japanese pop culture right?)
Many men don‚Äôt really understand that
Definetly mommy. Too similar to [NAME] from the legend of [NAME].
*Now* he wants to negotiate? We don't believe you, T–Øeasonous T–Øump...
Damn... that‚Äôs another thing I didn‚Äôt even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn‚Äôt steal food
Yeah the family loved you, who played porn at a family gathering with no warning. Sure.
? ur slide is right stick
Idk what that means
Maybe try living a little longer before you talk about things you don't know about, sweaty. NEXT!
Nice of you to jump in for no reason, very cool.
What law did they break? This is just another example abusing a system for profit without the necessary laws in place to protect people.
I agree I think they hyped it up
Go find your own [NAME]!!!
That k9 cop is such a bad ass Look at him carry this guy
Na, he has a real chance! ;)
I didn't know until a couple months ago. I'm 41. I know exactly what you mean.
We cant say dodgeball these days. It‚Äôs forbidden. Like how we call anal sex ‚ÄúLawyer love‚Äù now.
"""We need to be careful about hiring this one"" "
Your welcome.
I‚Äôm sure [NAME] was thinking this when he told his daughter that she stunk like a toilet on his deathbed.
As someone who's had whooping cough as an adult I will physically beat down anyone who says that especially about their kids
You will need power by it for the bolt to the level where you want to cut a bit easier to avoid getting it on the box!
Welcome! :)
[NAME] didn't want to win though. She got what she asked for
What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
Glad you feel better! My offer still stands though, if you need someone, I‚Äôm here
I wonder if that child puts it on his resume.
Congrats on the IP shadowban my dude
I was going to say is there even such a sensor? Turns out there is...
Weird, I checked again and it works for me now. It wasn't the first few times I tried to click.
Thank you! It really means a lot to me
No but the fact that it's even a possibility says a lot.
Omg yes lol
Sloths are cute! Especially when they‚Äôre covered in moss
From one of his posts: ‚ÄúYou and I both know full well that multiculturalism isn‚Äôt working, and that [NAME] need to go home.‚Äù
Oh he works as a medic in CA. So hes an Aemt in other states!
That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
The Party ID in this poll is 47.1% Dem and 41.2% Rep. In the trash it goes.
why not? standing to me isn‚Äôt as everything i need is on the floor lol
Apologies, I should have been more specific. Where abouts is JD? 
Yeah I remember when they banned bathrooms, crazy thing. 
Right? Go down the street to the next gas station and leave home girl in the car
sorry [NAME]! üòòüòòüòò
Texas, I'm really just mad at myself for not double checking. But now I have a year to find something better
Not adjacent. Far enough away that I am not easily in sight but could get to the hook 2-3 seconds after I see that glint of movement.
"Funny part is There ISNT a wall (but maybe should be) and there ARE already plenty of ""Sensible"" Gun laws"
All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
This not the first or second mistake by VAR against us.There was even an wrong offside against us some games ago and they didn't checked it.
If this is how earth is meant to function then it is a literal hell, as dark luciferian beliefs reign supreme.
Bore my children
DSJ, [NAME], [NAME], Zion/Draft, [NAME] would be exciting to watch.
I would have said ok well I'll just take this back to the store.
I wish, have to wait 3 weeks
40k concurrent viewers on twitch and 100,000s of views on multiple YouTube vids would argue your point 
Funny never not will be this.
At least your stepdad didn't just take the pillow look at you and leave...
I'm now scared to post this link]( I guess I should [stop.
No stop. One Red and yellow team had to be sacrificed for the fortunes of the other. I‚Äôm sorry
Most of them don't technically breach the actual law, to my knowledge. Plenty of them are distasteful to me personally though.
Thanks bro. This is do or die for me. Will value my streak like gold.
"You did not say you thought you did you said ""they both blocked me"" and then went back and edited your comment. LOL."
That moment when you feel isolated in r/ForeverAlone. Never had anyone like me
You drive from Burlington to London to school???
Mmm I dunno about that üòä but thank you
Wow, talk about being [NAME].
I've always thought it was weird that they keep their hard drive on the left.
If she loves the place she‚Äôs at why leave? There‚Äôs something to be said for that. Idk your all‚Äôs financial situation tho
The dude was absent in the Ohio State game... IDK I would be very worried if he was the pick.
Exactly, I remember loving those videos but I was also like 12
Someone had posted the last known addresses here yesterday. I'll have to go and find it.
You‚Äôre welcome
Wow... drug smugglers will always find a way I guess. I bet that took a ton of work
Good luck my friend!
They should have had Paragon in that pole.
The taste is subjective and it's certainly not good for your health
No need to bully me.
THANK YOU!!
I would not bother. He read your message and did not reply yet. So that's already a bad sign and not a good start.
Good dog.
Maybe Orlando for Bolts vs Cats? Or Daytona might be better
I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
Haven‚Äôt watched the new episode yet but the art definitely reminds me of [NAME] MS Paint art.
you can't damage anything other than on foot players right now, no turrets, no vehicles, no objectives, it has been bugged since the december update
Absolutely fair, and I can't blame you for that.
And you act like [RELIGION] wasn‚Äôt used to fuel slavery and control slaves go off tho...
whos the killer
So what's your point? It's colder today than it was yesterday. /s
And I for one welcome our new meme overlords.
The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
Wow, this is terrifying.
i wouldn't call that passive aggressive at this point, it's flat out aggressive and i love it.
agree, we are living in the feminist era where women want to be equal - so why should they be 'selective' in whats equal or not.
I'm so glad [NAME] is better looking than how he's depicted in UFC EA 3
Not all of them, but this guy happens to be in a team called Moustache Mountain.
That was oddly specific
Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME].
It is so good to hear from you. Stay safe!
So many nice things here. Good vibes. Enjoy your cake day and weekend. ‚úå
oh, it's free with prime now, added to watch list.
"My daughter loves this! She's taking a bath rn singing ""fiire"""
A demonstration of a product or technique. Destiny 2 base game is a demonstration of its actual content. Now, what is the definition of an opinion? 
If there is an ordered psychological work-up, will it be 3 days and 3 nights and will they decide if she needs to stay longer? thank you
Agreed, if you think about the animals it's sad. If you think about zerocarbers' blood profiles it gets amusing.
No jerk behavior from kitten but watching people interact with that machine was mildly fascinating.
Is that were its from ? All i know is since i was young that is scary af !
I think it it would have been even worse if that was the case
With Firing Range and Seaside having 2 variations, and everyone voting to replay them every time...It already feels like this
Thank you for highlighting this. No wall. DACA is (almost certainly) fine for another year.
Better stay out of trouble or they might send you off to a jihadi madrasah girls school
Weird how they shoehorned s character from an ongoing tv show into Celebrity Big Brothter. Glad they got rid of him after one episode though.
"I can safely say as a ""frozen pizza connoisseur"" across various ovens, I've never had an unevenly cooked pizza from it being on a pan."
Thanks, I love salad.
No she does not, not alone and not during sex(sadly) 
When people bring up rape culture they mean stuff like this. Because yeah it‚Äôs been out and swept away and not raged over
True man true
I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety.
Just remember I love you
[NAME] is the gift we all deserve
That's not the point. It's not supposed to be unexpected, this subreddit simply is dedicated to the memorial today.
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
Now remember, if something goes wrong, let's not get the law involved, one hand washes the other. Oh, that reminds me. 
Haha look at these liberals crying about children being raped in cages haha what snowflakes haha
I should‚Äôve used that when my dog died.
That shit sent me on a fucking journey to read.
I don‚Äôt. I love humanity. Why are you afraid of democracy?
They should fight to have Vans remove the [RELIGION] star from the back of their shoe.
I am but me and my SO live separate lives.
Why is anyone surprised. It has never worked.
I reallllly loved the show. It disturbed me a lot, definitely. But I want more now.
Glad he didn‚Äôt try to backpedal about his feelings. They are valid and he has a right to have them.
[NAME] got moved cause hes a complete liability in the defensive end
That way you‚Äôll get both food and laxative all in one. Sounds like a fair trade to me.
Add a _little_ sugar to the water when you feed downed bees. Acts like artificial nectar and gives them enough energy to get going again.
Haha I thought that was more subtle than something like HOO DINI or banana bus.
Downvote me into oblivion but both [NAME] and [NAME] shot around 35%. However one they say he balled out and the other one was struggling.
are there any unique foods to houston? thanks!
Are you here to solve my catsup problem?
Thanks. Wish he liked me
"""cool little surprise"" ow youtubers: NEW HERO NEW SKINS NEW MAPS NEXT WEEK?!"
This gave me PTSD
Considering that the majority of people who play poker still open limp, I'm surprised these posts aren't more common.
Ya. It's not what you think to start. Awesome show ending within 5 seasons with a planned ending. It's refreshingly hilarious. Netflix available.
The west is so unfair :(
I love the idea if choosing an outfit based on what kind of person I wanna be that day. Sounds like a fun way to experiment.
Grab her testicles
well you see [NAME] skinned [NAME] alive during their feud and is now wearing her skin like a suit and that is why [NAME] suddenly looks good
You made the right choice. Helps to get him out of mind, out of sight and begin the healing process.
Very succinct and accurate
"If ""everything is political"" then nothing is political because it's all the same. You know what I meant by ""political""."
That‚Äôs a joke between our buddies. A euphemism of sorts...
Employer? Or emploie? Emploiier isn't a word in French
If it didn't harm people who have no choice in the matter, I'd say let these people kill themselves.
This one tilted concrete square in my neighborhood that I keep fucking tripping over.
Tomorrow [NAME] tweets ‚ÄúSee! I told you [NAME] took responsibility! No shutdown! No collusion! Bad! Sad!
Correct, so who's the devil? Did you know that in the original Hebrew text [NAME] means adversary?
"its admittedly shallow and petty but I love the saying ""libertarianism is astrology for men"""
Chiclets bump!
You mean not enough
Talk to a psychologist. Sorry but they can help if you think you have a problem
Very interesting. Thx
I am 63, D cups, no sag. I must be a unicorn!
What's where the underwater level is.
"The Beatles weren't even close to being ""in the past"" when they broke up."
Fun ruiner.
This, like it varies and fluctuates
That‚Äôs me! Got it at the sens store by 304
:) I like this.
Cute, super cute 
So you're saying my man was murdered...
Oh noo! You are the best dog owner :)
Calm down bro
Back in my day an epic gamer moment was yelling out the n word at women and minorities
"C1,2 7.30 pm [NAME] to [NAME], ""I how how you can throw down"" HAHAHA!!! "
I‚Äôm not sure even know sits a fucking painter‚Äôs tool. I hate everything about everyone in this video.
DAMN!!!
I see you utilized it. 3.5? Sad.
.. :< you're welcome ;;
I'm sorry to hear that. Wish I could be here to help you, stay strong 
So... she just won the lottery!!
Here comes the ‚ÄúTrade Nylander‚Äù crowd - people can‚Äôt see past the stat line.
Looks about 17 years old here
There's a user here that advocates for disarmament and authoritarianism. I've noticed that a new username pops up periodically with similar content/ views.
I would be impressed if [NAME] ate 15% of his weight every day I wish I lived in a state where the contest was valid. Stupid NY
lmao, have not heard that insult before, that's a good one. Only good thing you have come up with yet and I bet you stole it kek.
Do you have a link? I never saw the video, I only heard about it
I guess this is place where we are thankful for Microsoft complexity.
[NAME], [NAME] mother. I loved her in the one episode. She had great chemistry with everyone she met. 
That's why you report them for impersonating a government agency. It's highly illegal, and you can report them online 
Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
[NAME] Immediately thought of you when I saw this thread. Can‚Äôt stop laughing. But. I‚Äôll wear yours someday and no others
And yet still just outside of the playoffs and not the worst team in the last 10 games.
What year did I wake up in?
ME TOO HE IS MY FAVORITE KILLER TO GO UP AGAINST [NAME] FROM NURSE!
I don‚Äôt see that ending well for [NAME]
Oh dear.
Skiing is great but I haven‚Äôt been skiing yet this season rip
sadly it is ;-;
Wow, guess my penis is small after all..
I unfortunately can not afford a lawyer. Luckily the only thing that we shared is our daughter
Can you imagine being the person in this costume #mascotlivesmatter
Exactly. How that woman has survived two no confidence votes amazes me.
How? She gonna round up some more tricks to do so cause I don't think she's worked a day in her life.
This was ten years ago...but I have faith in people to be nice. Knoxville was amazing when I lived there.
Damn. And loosing all Progress on the first Char ?
He's saving guys for the back to back.
Miami - Dade
How about as a whole we just hate snow
Legend! Cheers bro
Stay at home if you‚Äôre sick
Yeah it's like there's no difference between a prostitute or a girl they date except that one is free and has less diseases.
The real gay_irl is always in the comments
Well cancer is sort of like a constant injury....
> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements.
Wait u went to a hooker? I thought it was a massage person that was attracted to you
How do you know if this gets downvoted to hell, but a lot of times before dying (6 hits taken.).
I didn't need that eye, anyway.
He used to be her boy but now it‚Äôs like it never happened like in Toy Story 2
Thank you! Ill sign up as soon as its working! I checked it a few min ago and its still giving the error.
it's embarrassing you think that pact is an example of them getting on well together, especially considering the millions of deaths that followed
I understand the confusion
>Also, you realize that both parties largely dabble in identity politics. Oh absolutely! It's a major reason I hate [NAME]. 
"I'll take PVZ. Your flair: ""Maybe necks time"""
Yeah I agree, it really is interesting. I guess that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many different medications out there lol.
Jeepers I should have been asleep two hours ago
That's such a selfish mentality to have.
"Speaking of /u/'s ""If your nips aren't leaky....if you ain't lactating....YOU SHOULD BE FUCKING PRACTICING!"""
Dude. His wife and baby girl.
Human faces are remarkably elastic, aren‚Äôt they?
Did you kill the shark to get the shark teeth for your necklace yourself or was it premade? Thanks [NAME]!
I guess I should specify. I would like a 'right' and 'left' political viewpoint.
Now that's ride sharing!
Then she gets on r/spacedicks and next thing you know she‚Äôs a man and wants to date other species.
Lmao you fart bigger to cover up the first one
Would it be great if they instead swap around old-rich-guys blood
She had so so so many great looks. I can‚Äôt remember them all now, but she hardly ever made a misstep in regards to fashion. 
Haha love it we'll uhm not the penis
We all do it sometimes don't worry.
Daily would be great, but...life stuff like work sometimes get in the way.
Maybe check the song title one more time chief. Love the song tho. Also today‚Äôs a Scared of the Dark kind of day for me
Another pathetic PP.
Thanks. I'm in the same boat about being against therapy. Good luck to you too.
Hope the best for him
Gotta boost that self esteem.
Memes that were made 2 or more years ago don‚Äôt count. They were probably funny back then, just not now.
I heard [NAME] was an absolute monster too... Jk folks
Hope this place will still be around in a few years time!
I don‚Äôt think most people suck for 4 yrs and then figure it out again
This made [NAME] [NAME] verrrrrrry famous this year. She was always famous but this year her sounds and food descriptions won her the top award!
Oh and I forgot to add: he doesn't take your money and become a financial burden on your life
Damn he has a kid with evan rachel wood too. He gets all the honies.
Cats are repulsive and they don't deserve to be pets
Fuck the haters [NAME] > Everybody
istanbul and ankara matters. Also percentage-wise it acts as a nationwide survey. Out of ordinary results like below 38 or over 48 would be very important.
It sucks that you had to go through that. I hope you're doing fine now (and your kids if any).
This thing happened a couple years back, still haven't gotten back into the working world. Though, I appreciate the support.
Can‚Äôt argue with that.
Everyone‚Äôs ageing on here like the milk my flatmate left on the kitchen counter over the holidays
You are definently not in the wrong because you didnt actually him. Also does your brother get any special privledges that you dont?
[NAME] it'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.
I'd keep taking it. The side effects should go away soon. Paxil has been the only med that helped me.
Abortion. emails. BENGHAZI! red cups Happy Holidays
Except [NAME] isn't under our control or capable of having an impact on our team. We traded him. lol
So I see! Very nice. Thanks for the explanation :)
One day I just want to show up to my parents‚Äô with a Starbucks cup or maybe some Taco Bell on a Sunday.
What a totally innocent and integral part of our society! So glad our tax money can keep him company over his year long holiday!
I've only seen the beginning of this video...until today.
I swear people just want to be angry
Im glad youre going to be a perfect parent who never makes any mistakes. Make sure you write a book!
This. Making my animals happy is one of the only things that makes me happy.
I still maintain the packers were a worse team this year.
Of course he loves you! You‚Äôre his sugar momma. Seriously, ditch the bi*|‚Ç¨. You can and should do better. 
I like turtles
"""Keep blowin'! Love always, [NAME]."""
"Dentist did this to me I hate it. I knew i should have waited until ""it wad worse"" but i didn't. I regret it "
I am just asking for job-advice. I have dealt with this condition for a long time, and know what medical therapies are effective and feasible for me. Thanks
my heart melted omg [NAME]
It's one of my most hoped-for things. I think you should be able to approach a player and request a duel. It would be sick
This is so powerful.
No. Well...maybe. Good point.
Ask him for guidance? Ask for some time dating others? Is he polygamous?
Came here for the [NAME] reference, was not disappointed!
You should have said ‚Äúmight even have enough for a minute‚Äù u would have downgraded this to ‚Äúterrible pun‚Äù
Lol. I realize that. I know plenty of people like y'all
I would think that would be pretty awkward having phone sex with a stranger
Are you one of them? Sorry. You asked for it. üòÇ
Also, there's no point in having a job if it doesn't pay substantially more than the childcare costs.
Ones with close ties to SA, anyway. An escaped apostate won't exactly be itching to run home.
"You forgot to put ""armchair"" in front of your name."
Disgusting amount of oil.
"Yea, so you need to leave him. Clearly not great in the ""protect your loved ones"" situation. "
Try being a Cubs fan in the Bay Area. I was walking on thin ice in 2016 haha.
Yeah, I don't think I'd get along with /u/77096, either.
try to attract the guy that i like. other than that i love gaming drawing writing and watching tv.
[NAME] vs. Being an actual coach
Its all good until that episode where [NAME] traps the bat on [NAME] head comes on and she screams bloody murder and wakes us up.
Nope. I like looking at people.
Is he not supposed to have what he wants? What he needs?
Wow, congratulations!! Hugs 
My family never cared enough, I wish they did...
It is good game, they are good generation!
oooh yeah your comment makes sense now :)
As a computer science student but also a lifelong [NAME], the issues surrounding Amazon in Queens have left me substantially torn. 
How do you think she left her nose outside of the bucket? You think that's the way her smashed nose normally looks?
You just worded it badly, like we all SHOULD want to see it change, which many of us don‚Äôt.
I'm glad it helps, best of luck on your journey. You've gone 7 days clean, keep doing what makes you clean for 84 more!
That‚Äôs cool man! You have a good night!
I've been a subscriber for six months, and I'm not sure what KIA is about, as I can't be bothered to look at the links
So you‚Äôve known each other a while, but how close are you?
i choose alcohol. not recommended and ofc doesnt help to overcome anxiety, it just reduces its symptoms for a while...
You're right but ‚Äùjust be confident‚Äù (I know that you didn't say it ) is really hard when you're unattractive
Good to know my paranoia has paid off haha, and same, sooo many snacks.
I wonder if the mapgen portion of the population will die in the first place. Dwarves just waste all their time working on the labyrinth it hits 30.
something something thats how we do it in philly
First [NAME], now [NAME]. Stop the conks. Please. 
Lol I can‚Äôt wait to end up on this sub one day.
One million points for Slytherin!
Great Photo. Really showcases what most outsiders expect when they come to Nashville for a show!
[NAME] and [NAME] for Trout?
At least they got the ball back after the BS PI that was called. We just had to take it gave them kick the GW FG.
I miss rock fest üòî
Gotta wash your ass somehow. It makes it more funny that someone is as offended by it as you though.
My wife with BPD hasn't even kissed me in over a year. Get used to it if you're sticking around.
I don't blame you, this sub makes me feel crazy on a daily basis. 
Still depressed but I didn't run away so it cool
I just saw the same, apparently she upheld her views in a 2016 interview. 
The definition is simple: relationship -> sex friendship (not f+) -> no sex
I hope you and your retarded phone have a nice day!
Ok but it‚Äôs easy to worry when the legal drinking age in your nation is one of the lowest among first-world countries.
Wait, am I the only one who thought [NAME] was the tallest since childhood? 
But they are spectacular.
No no no. They only have no worth if they don‚Äôt support [RELIGION].
Thank you kindly.... I appreciate the support. Could you elaborate on the tip please? Thank you
Maybe we knew someone was going to sigh and this was all in the works. Just a thought idk. FUCK
Low life basement dweller buttcoiner says what?
"I guess ""hungasfuck"" or whatever is not doing gif recipe vids anymore lol"
> Humans are empathetic and do this daily. I have to remind myself of this sometimes.
Only 2 days ?
Are you really saying a leashed dog has the same potential to attack as a non leashed dog? Lmao.
I can‚Äôt stop staring at the boobs
Every. Bloody. Time. I never learn to just shut up though.
It was a painful cringe, too. Are we masochists?
i just wanted to thank you. it took long to find a place where i can voice my thoughts
I'm beginning to wonder how I lived before without these daily posts.
SHE HAS NICE FEET!!!!
Yeah I bet they 'work hard' nowadays and took 'big risks' for their money.
Whoa now, easy there on the logic.
I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I‚Äôm so glad my imagination wasn‚Äôt right.
FFS, there is a [NAME]?!?!? Seemed really qualified for that county job. So glad to see this family go downhill....
Very sweet of [NAME]
I never donate to 90DF go fund me. We can thank [NAME] and [NAME] for starting the trend.
It doesn't go to neutral. Every throw break leaves the characters at a different frame advantage/disadvantage.
Nah, I think it's being as dull as a butter knife.
I might be alone here, but it was probably Blame Game. I don't think I heard a rap song with that much emotional intensity before.
Yeah [NAME] has won worlds
"It's like calling a snake a ""danger noodle"" or a hedgehog an ""ouchy mouse"". It's just like a silly thing"
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
Here puffing on the crack pipe isn‚Äôt a conservative value, kind of excludes you from this wonderful utopia you speak of. 
It doesn‚Äôt look like anything to me.
I have never seen a curly haired cat! TIL
Im gonna go on those subs, wish me luck
This is disgusting.
Most athletic play [NAME] ever made. Wow
This goes back like a decade though. He just has the palette of a 4 year old.
Oh yeah didn‚Äôt notice the username. Yeah please do. I just recently got into photography. Total noob but I love it.
How did they not know internets is a point reward in 4chan?
Is it though? All the highschoolers I knew were too broke to be using juuls. Everyone had a suorin and the only ones with juuls were drug dealers.
He's an angry elf
I would love to accidentally get muscular... Instead of working my arse off to lose fat at the moment.
You're an idiot and no one believes you and your telegram jerk-off buddies.
He left the bench and is back in the locker room with the medical staff
Go watch the video where she does [NAME] makeup, [NAME] is super tall, especially compared to [NAME]. 
Damn it!
This sounds very familiar...
At least we've always got other people here who understand.
I see, I can't see it. I'm on mobile. Thank you very much for the info. Have a lovely Wednesday afternoon!
You made yourself useless playing their game instead of forcing them to play to your strengths
Aw thats so sweet A loving cimmunity is what [NAME] and [NAME] deserve for giving us such amazing content every day
[NAME] isnt right wing. Hes center left.
That's no trip. That's a hip check with flair.
> Same guy that was saying about this time last year that using P2PKH was harmful to Bitcoin and people should use SegWit. Liar
Yeah I thought so too :)
Been together 6 years, and I think she's the best person I know. I'm still in the phase where I love her more everyday.
Any time [NAME] is brought up is a good time for this:
How courageous of this man. He helped a distressed wild animal that can rip him to shreds. Good job sir.
Damnnnn nice feed bro. That choke throw to the spin attack was on point.
I fucking love ten min power hour xD
Popeyes spicy tenders
Her hair has looked it‚Äôs best since around 2015ish. I love the dark hair on her with the subtle pops of color.
She sounds like she could be depressed. People who have depression need care, love and help to get better, not internet shaming. 
Fry a egg with that bad boy. And you got yourself a nice breakfast.
Oh [NAME] üôÑ
It's satirical but also almost truth. We're the fattest nation in Western Europe and that percentage is growing.
Thank you. Posted this to Facebook!
You are fucking retarded
Man of the people....
Finally gonna get together with [NAME]. Love is beautiful.
Take a break then get back out there!
exactly. you're a child. you make personal attacks when you lose an argument. I feel sorry for you.
Its not better then PoE.....by a longshot.
Ahh gotcha - thanks :)
"CREEP FACTOR MIDNIGHT ""virgins gonna be scared"""
Is there a quiz version of this where I can answer what I think and then at the end it tells me who matches the best?
Nice try cat daddy ;)
Entry level?
Didn't he also come in half way through the season? üòè Not defending [NAME] or hating on [NAME]. 
didn't work anyway
How did they respond? You can't leave out the best part.
I hope your struggle is worth it. Stay strong.
The funny part about it our club has the hide to tell us eels fans that it was the game of the year. ü§£
As guaranteed me under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
[NAME] at least seems to have gotten her life together... (I mean I hope the same happens for [NAME], but)
Tell me more about this policy. They still fire here for defending yourself.
Don't be angry. Encountering toxic people in online games is common and you won't change that. Try playing single-player or games with more sophisticated community
It's okay [NAME]. It was time you went home anyway, you're kinda drunk.
I do not believe she has any secret information, but I still suspect she's in danger and her plan has backfired substantially.
I have so many questions...
It's time to trade our expiring deals and finally rebuild properly. Dont let me down Weltham!
The clothing comes in individual plastic bag from manufacture, but I do agree with the plastic packaging for the jewelry. That amount of plastic is unnecessary.
Nobody said they don't have the right. It's still embarrassing.
That's good to know, then. You can eliminate that possibility from your mind. But gosh. I'm so sorry you went through all that... 
Free with a price of $600+ if you want full standard collection or maybe $300+ if you grind with no life. What a deal!
No they scoop slop at the dfac
praise be to the dark mother!
I don't think fantasy draft has been a thing for a few years in career mode.
Indeed. Ex-NY area cop here, similar to dirtbag, shitbird, and fuckstick, but more acceptable for TV.
$20 paywall out $20 'starter pack' in ‚Äî this would be great
A classic question. He wanted to create to share His love and existence.
Sorry, but anarcho-anything are bot welcome there
Or better yet, on the woman who will let ME play with them!
You‚Äôll pay for that.
That guy was a true [NAME].
If you don‚Äôt want to debate, don‚Äôt reply to the comments. That starts the debate.
It's real enough sadly. Kin have been around for awhile in their own corners of the net.
And there may be fare reduction on the way ..... Or walk from William
Oh, I mean I guess he‚Äôll run if he loses. But do you think he will run if he wins? 
Yes!!!
Because no one was seriously hurt - - - It's hard not to watch this without laughing.
yeah fuck you too okay
Article is behind a pay wall
Its like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
That was beautiful.
Thank you !
Word. I have 0 of these in my life. I miss my INTJ ex brother-in-law haha.
Hopefully you don't come across too many crews like that yourself though. Always better when the combat is honorable.
He was left for dead on the streets after the procedure but survived, doesn‚Äôt specify how I think
Yeah the question makes no sense without more context.
Too busy being on that stupid ass mystery singer show
Calling your own side the dark side, I knew there was a reason I fancied you.
Me neither. We can‚Äôt figure out why [NAME] won‚Äôt compromise
No offense taken, and I agree with your last statement.
NOW she needs that scotch tape
Hear hear :(
Hahah is that what we call them here? Breeders? I'm not trying to be condescending that's just hilarious.
That's the exact person who would buy one of those
If everyone liked exactly the same thing, there would be a few very worn out girls and billions of lonely, horny guys
As row boats are abandonned all around it could be a very interesting little add . If , few randoms row boats had a old and used one in it
Pretty sure it was New Orleans.
"To say the ""New Jersey area"" lost 5700 millionaires and then explain that that includes New York City is silly."
I am sure the men here who have Career [NAME] and Supermodel [NAME] fighting over him will appreciate this sage advice.
He‚Äôs one of the calmest goalies I‚Äôve ever seen in general haha
‚ÄúI did do the nasty in the pasty.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that past nastification...‚Äù
Have thought most of the game was OK with some bad calls both ways... These last 5 min tho...
When we‚Äôre talking Prog music, ya it‚Äôs kind of important that it pushes boundaries.
How so? Even if she stop talking to him he'll just go talk to someone else.
Over in r/texas we are coming up with slogans to ecourage people to switch to renewable.
Unfortunately not.
Yes you can, you need to worry about em for a little while ago obviously doesn't handle as well as like 500lb heavier.
I'm not searching for anything, but even though I'd like them to be, I don't think anything I'm feeling is justifiable.
its not about claiming its yours, its just about where it is from
Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now.
"Glad it finally made it.. I was beginning to think ""[NAME], I hope this guy doesnt think I welched on the bet"". LOL"
They r like 5 dollars each
Sounds like an fp to me ü§î
I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(
Does she hate the men in her family too? O.O
[NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] would like a word...
The future is now old man
My bad.
If I ever see that in my area, that will be a bullet to the head. Fuck Reddit's rules.
I wish more than anything that I was [NAME]
If people were downvoting due to the perceived insensitivity of it, then I guess I understand. 
I thought I was the only one. And going insane.
What in the actual fuck are these refs doing right now.
Her attempts to be ‚Äúedgy‚Äù fall flat are incredibly cringeworthy.
Wow... never heard of that podcast. Looks awesome. Thanks for the link!
>[NAME] Why? I'm curious what you're thinking.
Oooh dont call the bad guys for help when your life is at risk okay.
Yeah i know, i'm just stating why it slipped my mind, i'm glad you brought it up. 
Nia even in its current state vr can help you with that. And maybe even more 5 years from now.
Wait. Mr. [NAME] was in Got!
So glad they had the clip of the dog getting up at the end. I was super worried.
Please no.
England is all about driver safety. Competence...well....
"Okay, well here's my response to people saying *""But Turkey is an NATO ally!""*: So?"
I like it!
Is she talking about his dickee?
When you look back at your picks and realize you‚Äôre laying pretty much entirely chalk Tenn -8 Bowling Green -4 Akron -1 NC STATE -1.5 Duke -21 MSU This should go well lol
Also thank you for the link.
Indifferent before leaving. Indifferent after. Although hasidic [NAME] are fucking mental.
If you wanna spend thousands for every piece of furniture then sure but a lot of people don‚Äôt have the budget for this.
A bit of storybook now and again never hurt anyone :D So happy for the both of you!
Devils Advocate - Didn't the cringe-worthy Nike ad end up benefitting them in the long run?
Agreed. How do you feel about the rumors that he doesn't pick any girl as an endgame?
I am. But I presume you are gonna tell me I'm wrong because it doesn't line up with your experiences - whatever.
Its literally bread on a bread board, whats the issue here?
I don't know any but my own I'm afraid.
I personally am very proud to be a vegetable. Corn, to be exact. Corn pride y'all
Bro he has always been a bully in the community. He is a pseudo scientist.
[NAME] should be sticking that to the other side of the keeper, strange decision to go for that corner
You guys are the reason I had my first smooth hit in months, thank youü§òüèΩüôèüèº
Thank you for that statement.
"I drove to Alaska from Washington state a couple years ago in a tractor trailer. Those roads are already pretty ""interesting""."
I didn't downvote you but Emirates 1st class suites are ridiculously nice.
This is a fact
Leaving [RELIGION] and planning to FINALLY live MY life to the fullest without white men in white shirt telling me what to do every second of my day!!
Man I wish that was a real sub
"""You know, this should have never happened."" Well no shit you dumb ass!"
So...you can link those then right?
come back!
[NAME] is an **integrity** man. Without it, there is nothing. edit 1:without it, not with it, sorry typo
"Not making many new NYC fans: ""I'd rather live in Auschwitz than NYC""!"
Congrats!!! Happy for you.
Funny. My wife is currently trying to grow shrimp by feeding the algae to them. She has some optimistic results!
I might have accidentally brought some back when I went to Peru. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ah man I loved pisco.
Maybe they want to be a show couple ?
Your name is amazing
And I thought I was too old for this drama (I‚Äôm 25)
That must smell so good. Oh i want some now.
Ah, then apologies for my ignorance, and thank you
I‚Äôll buy it i don‚Äôt care
I'd say [NAME] at 8 is pretty disrespectful
For a 30 yo WR I'd package [NAME] and a 2020 2nd rounder. But I'd rather get [NAME] and draft a guy in the 4th.
should have expected that ending ... but nice new (?) twist on that common joke
NO NO NO NO STOP STOOOOOP [NAME] is a good friend of mine, he‚Äôs aware they aren‚Äôt canon but I respect him for making OC.
Forgot he had been sent down and was really confused, but happy about this post.
You need to use ladies man perk and an item that has seduction +150.
Thank you :)
My son and I both enjoy taking pictures. It gives us pleasure. Part of the fun for us on vacation is taking pictures of new things.
They're wrong, it was due to their natural wetland habitats being degraded & drying out. 
Still wish [NAME] hadn't sent him away the way he did.
We are very clumsy creatures. Eventually you just learn to laugh it off. *The crying comes later when no one is around*
He looks like the son of [NAME] and [NAME].
Thank you. I needed to hear this. Currently kinda spiraling pretty bad
"If you know it's the right thing to do, it's better to ""lose"" that person than to ""lose"" that opportunity."
I like this idea.
I giggled. Then looked at my corgi and imagined him stuck butt first in a big wine bottle.
If a woman forces a man's penis into her vagina, that ABSOLUTELY IS a crime. Not sure what you're smoking. 
He likes an old song and is young DISGUSTING
Not true. Our knowledge of it is derived from the fossil record, which is geological.
I'd roast you, but someone would probably have an equally good enough roast and we would tie
Not this sub‚Äôs fault the ((([NAME]))) is full of idiots
Don't kiss your doorbell! Or anyone else's for that matter...
You didn‚Äôt offer any proof. She gave the dnc some money to stay afloat. You have yet to explain how that translates to them damaging [NAME] campaign
I am just afraid the Pistons front office, specifically [NAME] overvalues [NAME] and says no to this.
If they stop the music, urine luck...
How could they forget the gravy?
I am happy for you. No, seriously, I am.
You missed the point üôÉ
This report is going to be bullet proof
Sadly it happens randomly and I wouldn't want to lie to someone for money if the thoughts didn't appear.
Amazing. Professional athletes doing what they're paid to do.
Holy shit bro
Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that.
I like mother lode in weho. A bit loud but actively un-douchy.
that day humanity received a grim reminder
Does anybody else see strong parallels between power and freedom? Feel free to distinguish or correlate the two in a comment.
I love [NAME] as much as the next [NAME], but seriously man. Whatchu doing son?
They're a nakedly political institution, and have been for years now.
No it hasn't.
VODKA!! YOU ARE THE REAL MAN!!
The emblem on the left looks like a killer mrs puff from spongebob.
I say I love you to friends of both sexes and there's never been any problem, tbh I'm bissexual tho, so it should be weird either way
I went to your profile to see the other pics & saw your kitty. He's super cute!
I was pretty pissed when [NAME] was hired for exactly that reason but he at least had worked with [NAME] before
Perhaps I'm biased, but it seems to be the most popular. So many references in TV Shows and Movies. 
Sorry its such a long post guys
#THANK YOU FOR THE RED ARROWS. I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT WAS THE TOP COMMENT
How is this any different from women who claim that all men are awful people? I'm sure you dislike it when women do that.
We all lose it too fast from time to time...but you have to make up for it. Hope it gets better.
It still hurts 15 years later. I don't know how people can be so callous their own child
I saved it on my memories/highlights
"Narrator: ""They did not"""
Star Wars fans? Backlash? Nah.
That's interesting. Have you used it to register on many sites/services?
yes everyone does this!
I thought we were unlucky for having to put up with [NAME]. Man, you guys got the short straw with Ninja.
Can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs weird or like nice of you?
>It is tailored to your viewing history. That's fairly common knowledge nowadays isn't it? Weird thing for the comic to point out.
Pasta left to your door today is 4 years as outdated! Be aware. Some quality grammar there...
Anything intelligent to say, sometime maybe perhaps?
She missed the part where that's her problem.
I think they're good optics. Or do you not think that being openly intolerant toward surveillance encourages others to be openly intolerant toward surveillance in turn?
TOO. MUCH. HESITATION. [NAME] should've gotten that on net a second earlier
Allegedly boosted. Tournament is over and it went down to 10k
Utah is a beautiful state. I‚Äôll give you that. I spent a week at Bear Lake and it was pretty amazing.
Maybe not the only one but he is our best shot.
You sound like a creep dude
Thanks fam, maybe I'll replay the level
It‚Äôs certainly a cute concept.
Well that didn't take long, sorry for your loss :(
[NAME] is so rational, I‚Äôd just cry really hard if my parents spent all my college money üí∞ 
Oh the T word
Where did you see them? I‚Äôd like to watch too
I've done it 3-4 times as survivor and never got the trophy. I think I'll try as Killer, will be easier haha.
If you somehow survive that you go into the turbines, correct?
We discussed vaping, but decided against trying it due to the cost of investment in the equipment.
Not too picky? Aha, I tried that a few weeks back. Boom 50 matches. They're as desperate as us
Me too. Sweet!
They don't even have that anymore, since [NAME] up and left the party.
She is during her week of taking sugar pills. Yea I do wish she had mentioned it anyway, I can‚Äôt sleep
[NAME] investigation has already paid for itself thanks to Manafort. Try harder.
Will do bud 5>4 Celtics have one of the youngest rosters in the NBA, Sox just won a series over your southern folk
Leave it alone hopefully it won't pop overnight
Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.
No. I'm just against forcing your beliefs on people who aren't old enough to distinguish reality from fiction.
Sorry, I live in the real world. Just because you don't like facts doesn't mean they don't exist.
he refers to marijuana as a narcotic. da fuq??
My cat also thinks rugs are for pissing on.
According to what?
Lol. Weed is a he'll of a drug. I'm not changing a thing. Prey away.
Angry little boiii
Edgey poke, but no thanks.
NSFW If anyone is wondering what happened to his leg (0:48)
*sobbing* I love you bro, you always there for me *continues sobbing*
Waste of time
No since parries read the heavy press, not the release.
Seattle has both, and is building a huge extension to the existing light rail system. Traffic is still absolutely fucked.
Not the snowbank, though. That will end badly in spring.
Topic change #4. This is getting sad.
$13,99 in Canada. It's reaching a price where I may also do a few months at a time and then cancel for a few months.
Thanks!!
Damn, looking at that makes me realize just how bad of an owner [NAME] is. He overpaid on just about everyone (not [NAME] obviously)
FEATURE [NAME] NOW
Beautiful picture!
Yeah it's takes some time but use all that negative energy and focus on yourself.
That‚Äôs the silver lining of this. Fuck Veracruz.
Still no [NAME] on before him.. we're supposed to be proving how important he is to us
Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
The only clown that make me laugh.
Reddit is losing their heads on /r/worldnews and suddenly they're a huge fan of [NAME].
I was ok till that last one.
Your dog is soooo cute
That looks like a wig.
Fox News devoted 42 seconds on [NAME], wow.
[NAME] lol, took me a second too Edit: it appears Iowa has multiple sacks
Plus she's probably going through some extreme grief, life insurance is a huge practical concern for her right now. 
lol since when do you have to go to a orientation?
"It's called ""Duper's delight"". You see it frequently in sociopaths like serial killers, or politicians, or both, like [NAME]."
This hurts me
Please explain how this is stupid
Wow that‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm too used to that age group complaining about ‚Äúkids these days‚Äù. Thanks for sharing.
[NAME] isn‚Äôt a rookie, he played last year. Was pretty average but turned into a true RB1
Bye [NAME].
Welcome home [NAME]!
I think most of us would really just rather you calm down a bit and stop being such a jerk.
Suddenly went 6 to midnight TBH
Wow, such an unlucky finish... lucky we had DNB, really bad mistake by the goal keeper in the 95‚Äô 
After reading this comment, I wholeheartedly hope the rest of your life is beyond wonderful. ü§£
Then we can both work together and prove to ourselves that we don't need them and we can get better
Now we've come full circle
I like that idea!
I'll keep an eye out.
Yeah what a great sport!
Mouth hugs!
I'm not trying to disregard what your uncle did, however fruit is an incredibly fickle crop that is not viable in most climates over the long term. 
Haha yes I did
Lots of botox. That face doesn't move. She has to squint her eyes to indicate to others that she is mad.
I‚Äôm finishing that right now. Very fascinating.
Yeah, I haven‚Äôt kept up with that show lol 
You were so close.
PLAY FRONT BACK GO
I feel bad for her, talk to her :(
hmmmmm I still love [NAME] and a lot of OR candidates but thank you
All good brother
#I HATE BOTH EQUALLY
Congratulations. You posted the famous very first lolcat picture.
Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.
You didn't say they were racist channels
Happy one week anniversary
Nothing but net. He got a few phone numbers then ghosted lol.
As I understand it, the director? left so at least if they do reboot it it‚Äôll be in more competent hands lol
Thank you for at least doing something good sir.
Omg!! They are kinda turning [NAME] into new [NAME].
We draft [NAME] OUR ARMS WILL BLOT OUT THE SUN!
This is great. Good Yard!
Holy shit nice block [NAME]
Don't worry if you're from hot, we can share my slice (:
Didn't mean to offend
Lol seriously. I mean Vardos was really cool but other than that the story was so bland and predictable.
Tbh idgaf anymore too many people correct me and others over it. Who cares. But thanks for the enlightenment.
Thanks for finding out! That's cool
It involves a relationship with a girl so I need a girls input, sorry I‚Äôm not sexist or anything.
That‚Äôs a terrible amount of bp for 11 kills
Putting the opposite outcome of what [NAME] says is a close second imo
Can‚Äôt believe no one said [NAME] when she slept with [NAME]!!! I love [NAME] and I felt personally betrayed. Wish they never reunited.
The mood changes are semi controllable with medication (at least it‚Äôs the case for me). Please seek psychiatric help to get a proper diagnosis.
Thanks for admitting your a slob
I thought legends already started.
Good luck in the future man. We're not getting anywhere here. Have a great weekend!
"They gave it away when the guards(i guess) were talking and one of them goes:""But the shield hero..."""
I have a book that outlines why [NAME] reject [NAME] on the grounds of prophesies. Maybe you could work off of those?
Dont forget DnD being satanic.
Fuck daesh *
The kid seems more mature than his mother
Hi, yes? Ok, one moment... Hey OP, yesterday called and they want their post back. 
You are in the right here, and I support your actions
Yeah deffo seen mom do that trick with a Hotdog :) lmao
Eh, its up to you.. but Im not buying your girlscout cookies just because some of the troop drowned.
Nothing and I mean nothing will sway a trump supporter at this point
Im all for putting rapists in jail, and honestly i dont like [NAME] politically but they tried so hard to taint an innocent man in jail and thats sad
What did he get help with?
*scoff* maybe you can‚Äôt. /s
Hi, I'm [NAME].
Oh yes! You're great.
those pictures of [NAME] are real, he's on Crashing and the way he looked in the premiere was just awful.
its here! nice
I'm more interested in why there are goldfish in the picture...
Yes! Tell us E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G! She‚Äôs horrible but also very entertaining!
I realised after I typed it, but I left it up. I feel sometimes in life, you just gotta take the L. 
I really like your writing!
Tbh I don't quite get the hype behind [NAME]
That looked HARD
ask one of them on a date
I cannot believe how unbelievably well [NAME] is playing. It‚Äôs insane he hasn‚Äôt scored.
The tactical alliance between PYD and the US doesn't fit the characterization of intervention. That's also not relevant to what the hashtag is about.
Trying to read that made me feel like I just huffed formaldehyde amd mercury
Are you serious? Open up a fucking history book
That would be greatly appreciated.
I know the one. I bought my dad one as a joke for father's day. He keeps pens in it.
BF- If you dont beleive me come over than. *gf goes over to bf's house, sees bf* GF- Hmmm, I might be dreaming.

You also gotta be Japanese. If they were into interracial shit with white men that niche would already be filled.
This fucken essay
I thought Detroit or Oakland . . . and both have fantastic areas despite what pop culture might lead you to believe.
I was about to lose my shit but then I finally found the Plumbus
Wasn't that just a mass shooting? Or am I thinking of another college massacre?
I hope the surgery goes well and have a quick recovery üíö
Glad that's settled
Okay this is really promising stuff. I'm definitely excited for this.
I mean, you can definitely beat someone up passionately.
Haha exactly right!!
Because it‚Äôs possible. My partners mother had it and she passed very young as a result.
You are the parent your grandson deserves. Your daughter will regret the pain she has caused.
I get that the reason a restaurant would be out of the area is because it's the closest to them or it's the one they have chosen
Not sure how kittens ‚Äúlol‚Äù but I‚Äôll take your word for it.
"You know damn well they'd say ""Narudo"" and ""Assault on Titan 13"""
This reminds me of the Percy Jackson series :P they do the same thing at one point when they visit a dam :P
That's awesome. For the record, I do get anxious over very non intrusive questions, I really have a tenancy to read too much into things. 
If they take on Crabbe it could be alright. We should try to get [NAME] and [NAME] from Chicago while dumping Crabbe.
Thanks! It is too bad we can't suddenly age [NAME] and [NAME] a year or so.
This is the strangest rendition of our national anthem that I‚Äôve ever heard.
That looks expensive.
Why on earth would that happen? Do you really just discard all reality and think of things in terms of a pantomime?
Really glad the US just passed transparent pricing for healthcare providers, but it's just a first step.
Finally a whole season and 3 jornadas too late.
I think it was a one time thing because they still go for a lot more. I got lucky.
Ironic considering the amount of brigading AnComs do on this sub
Thermal shock has GOT to be some indie bands name
[NAME] Need people to play with so thanks :)
Thank you so much! Having these few subs for the quality videos he's creating makes the channel a hidden gem.
Yeah, I killed this post. Reddit is a great place and I'm glad I made my suggestion here.
Just borrow against your 401k, it would be stupid not to. Unless you plan to retire in hell.
Spork you're just deluded
You have my up-vote Sir! ;-) Moderation in all things!
Just saying, don‚Äôt give up. Fight back. Do it for your patients 
Thought it was StuPOTity when I first heard it....
Opposite reaction to the right trying to demonize her. The obsession with her from the right is insane.
I sorry know I can't watch it lol Edit: got 3 seconds in and had to abort. Walls started coming down.
There are worse things!!!:
Native [NAME] here. Whataburger overrated af.
Dude awesome job being the reading police, great work out there tonight. Keeping the streets safe.
Omg [NAME] is so cute in this artstyle
Now that the game is over, [NAME] can go back to jerking it to Tampa Bay highlights
That‚Äôs terrifying
I agree but I can‚Äôt force him.
The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
Sentence didn‚Äôt start with an apology, not sure if legit Canadian. 
When they figure out a way to hoard the wealth created by marijuana it will be legalized.
I see. Never get bored is my main goal :)
"I will donate money to the ""Buy a striker fund"" [NAME] up top is beyond frustrating. "
Ya! It was a bangin‚Äô movie! A super fun ride with characters I cared about.
ARGH!!
I feel your pain...
Then they will complain about it being cold in the winter.
I love lions. Wouldn't want one in my house though. Might scare the dog. Same thing with children for me!
This is absolutely lerfect, fantastic lunchpine.
Relevant:

That [NAME] laugh gets me everytime. League pass commercial breaks are the best.
Grado SR80e is what I have, $100 and the best headphones I‚Äôve ever put on 
Coinbase LOL people think place is the answer. I think it‚Äôs Cancer.
"But ""questioning"" overwhelming evidence presented with a comprehensive explanation without any sort of counterargument is perhaps better called *denying*."
This is maybe the lamest way you can say that.
At least we aren‚Äôt getting blown out. And Vegas is hot right now
Lol hows that different then [NAME]
Yeah my girlfriend hates it when I joke about her weight. She needs to lighten up too
If you succeed at killing yourself you can't attempt it many more times.
Haha! I love it. That‚Äôs exactly how it would go.
On my way! Thanks!
I hate these cakes so much.
I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
I have the same question I had before- you didn't attempt to explain why US healthcare prices ought be higher than Canadian.
I finished high school back in 2010 friend but yes good luck to me for the weekend üòé
Wow. This I definitely needed, I'm glad I stumbled onto your comment. Helped in a major way, thanks. 
I swear if he is drafted as a father son to Gold Coast, I wont be happy
[NAME] gives me the weirdest boner. I love these guys
Proud [NAME], proud European. There are at least 16m of us.
oh [NAME] what did i do
Also [NAME] raised money because so many of his subscribers are dumb enough to confuse an Indian company with the country of India.
Don‚Äôt wait. Take control of your life back and leave. You know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen.
Bruh if y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòInto the Spider-Verse‚Äô yet you gotta stop what you‚Äôre doing and go see it.
That's what *you* want you to think!
He needs to be tested. And you need a divorce lawyer ASAP. He needs to move out. Actions have consequences.
good luck my friend
wow wow wow hold my beer!
I don't know how everyone is falling for this lmao. Cringing a bit.
You're a big man
There is zero conclusive evidence supporting this position.
I don‚Äôt know who the hell [NAME] is but I am now curious after seeing the word ‚Äúagain‚Äù.
Ah I love when I‚Äôm looking at a random thread and find you in the comments. Hey [NAME]!
So, now that his chance of being PM is slipping away, he's going full [NAME] and invoking conspiracy theories. The man is scum.
Technically isn't the Harry Potter Universe still being developed too? We are getting prequels that could very well more directly mention [NAME] being gay.
I'm not sure you know what a [NAME] is
Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be
LOL this lasted long.
We‚Äôre used to crazy cold weather but this is much worse, a lot of people are just staying inside till Thursday.
What a muffin!
Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong
Oh my [NAME] coco I‚Äôm so sorry sweety
Nah they‚Äôre on there, just gotta scroll down some.
That was awesome. Momentum is really something isn't it?
I loved [NAME] as much as anyone but he started to become really inconsistent in his final stretch here before he ended up in Charlotte.
The only thing that changed is we are now healthcare-less
Pickeks are nice idk how many calories I eat day to day lol
Perhaps, but he got in after a 14 td 9 int season so I was basing it more off of that fact
Only six colors for this look, sweaty? I could do the same look with sixteen.
Which really gives a ton of insight into their psyche: they see interpersonal relationships as retail transactions, and then even beyond that go all choosing beggars. 
You must not sent a lot of time on the internet it Reddit is the worst racist site. 4chan, Breitbart, storwatch, the KKK official website...
Yeah this is pretty eye opening. I‚Äôve had pretty weird relationships with my reflection in the past but thankfully it‚Äôs not always this way.
It's a god awful feeling. It's changed me a little, but time heals wounds.
very interesting - I‚Äôll have to read up on him - thanks :)
Rip [NAME] and [NAME] if [NAME] exposes everything to [NAME]
Huh that guy seems cool, they'd probably lop his head off. 
Communism naturally results in dictatorship. When you centralize power, you invite the power-hungry. Every morally-motivated communist seems to think they're immune to the bullets of power-hungry totalitarians. 
True. And he's free to leave if he doesn't get it. Relationship is a dance
Lol, [NAME] got me :)
Spot on. You have astute comments.
Signing a 31yr old injury prone player for 5 years 60mil is pretty stupid. [NAME] would have been similar cost wise and he isn't made of glass
I mean most players get that
"I mean... It's about average. So not $200 but not ""throw it in the trash"" either. "
This is a slippery slippery slope that ends with the backstory to the Wrath of Khan dude.
Easy to forget [NAME] since he was hurt but I'd add him to your list.
[NAME] no, these are horrid on anyone.
I'm beginning to think that ArcSys might be my favorite videogame company. They make such good fighting games.
> On top of that, the article stated that some had even had their IUD ripped out by a partner. BLUUUUUURURRRRRRRGHHHHH WHYYYYYYY
Is that how it actually works?
who was [NAME] #2
Thanks for giving advice to the people who need it üëåüôè
Well hot damn
It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
The thing is, they've whipped themselves into such a rabid frenzy, literally anything less than the apocalypse is going to be a bit underwhelming.
A family friend was just found to have made this comment, I am interested to hear your thoughts. 
And here's quick exercise. Can you list five little things you're grateful for? Not big things...little things.
Which could mean new faces
Shit he gets too close to a girl and she's liable to hit him with roach spray.
Bless you!
I‚Äôm up here too man, having a great time so far!
Are you serious?
[NAME] is a fantastic player, but would he be a regular starter over at Juve? He needs to stay at Arsenal.
Mandle jokes.
>For someone that has never really watched the show or read the books that much What?
> Because I was a disgracefully gullible, immensely stupid fucking dipshit ~~was~~ *am* FTFY
OK sweaty, have fun in ur collapsing Union while I'm restoring the Empire xoxx
All of Leviticus is wonderful and interesting. (But I do get the point you are making).
Ah, yeah. That's the trouble with anywhere that isn't London/NYC, especially if you speak English.
Yep. Two actually. Both older. Brother undiagnosed, sister diagnosed. It‚Äôs been a hellish nightmare... 
It seems you've never played HotS.

If she deleted your Snapchat just because you showed up to a bingo, then it seems she's a bit of a bad person

He landed badly on his shoulder at full speed. Definitely wasn‚Äôt nothing
I've actually taken this opportunity to get back into making YouTube videos.
Video games are great, but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to unplug and play a game of Jenga with your cat
You look like [NAME] from firefly :)
i've never been baby crazy but goddamn if i'm not always craving an adorable puppy in my arms üò≠üò≠
Fuck, my wife and I spent less than a *fifth* of that. Wow. 
Wow... Mid 2000's this would of been a way better follow up to Space Jam and probably just as if not more popular.
Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
"The people who say ""He/she doesn't owe you an explanation"" have a skewed perception in my opinion and may even be people who enable such behavior. "
[NAME] and [NAME] = The hero's we need, but not the hero's we deserve.
Oh perfect- I am surrounded by [RELIGION] and they LOVE those kinds of ‚Äúparties‚Äù
It's far too busy
I dare you
I think they are being sarcastic, notice the /s 
I thought this was a diary that I wrote in my notebook! I'm almost exactly the same!
I definitely saw a tweet where someone threw their razor in their toilet. They‚Äôre gonna have to fish it out sometime...
I used to have fun with it and didn't feel angry aside for when [NAME] was op lol
...wasn't she recovering from pneumonia at the time?
This is getting old.

Sorry. This happens to too many good people.
Happy birthday kiddo, free updoot for u
Why!? I just don‚Äôt understand why? Somebody tell me why?
I really appreciate you saying that And yes he is the cutest
No. Not worth both whatsoever with what we need to fill
You guys are so cute together! Good luck with the de-stressing!
Such nice, silly, warm friends once you get to know how to act near one. You have to learn the secret scratchy place too!
Strangely enough 70% of women in the work place are queen bees
Haha Nice. I finished paying [NAME] back about a year ago. Great feeling! Congrats.
What did I just read
persistence that is working perfectly fine...thanks to backup scripts lol
I just want tk be a random scumbag
I should have known better, its obviously not a juul. I was just happy to see Oliver Tree tbh 
That escalated quickly.
How cold is it? I keep hearing about Chicago today.
But he makes her vagina sing! How else is she supposed to act around him. Haha
I love this. you get a favorite.
Japanese Raws? This manga is ongoing and next chapter is 217 as far as i'm concerned
"That's weird to hear since in Hebrew ""Son of man""- Ben Adam, simply refers to humans in general."

That goes both ways, their adrenaline and determination would also be through the fucking roof.
I just go over my FEASMs head for that.
I‚Äôll join your cause brother!
You're right! I linked the wrong one. Thank
At least I can get laid in my natural state.
That comment reads like something out of a circlejerk sub. I can't believe it was said unironically
There‚Äôs no wrong way to do an enema.
Why? They deserve it.
Not if I legalize it. Then you can buy it.
Investments like that are a paper trail. Ordering takeout food and riding Go-Karts with cash, are not.
Nah I'll be right thanks [NAME]
So 10 bucks says shes just gonna leave him after this anyway
It‚Äôs showing up on mobile aswell, the double slash is weird for me though, probably on his end
It‚Äôs 5:11am over here. Good luck dude.

I mean, yeah, I'd complain a little. But then I'd eat the crap outta that.
Maybe work on being a little more optimistic for the future......don't be a debbie downer! :)
Said it all year, I think losing [NAME] hurt this team in more ways than we'll ever know. 
He probably enjoyed it so much with his frat brothers that he's willing to buck his own party for good weed.
The perfect amount of salt for me
That‚Äôd be amazing
Lol still makes me laugh
Watching Revenge sometimes makes me cry, thinking back to when I tried to memorize that song, and listened to it over and over.
I don't have a problem with it if its a cheese or charcuterie board
"They seem to have very ""sick"" laws in Saudi Arabia. Where women don't have any protection from government against their perpetrators."
Fair enough haha
I am very thankful for that. And thankful I wasn‚Äôt totally brainwashed
Why is it shocking? All professional sports is all about bottom line first-period!
Stadium remains the best dlc map of all time
Damn, that was brilliantly put. Thank you. I screenshotted it to use on Twitter. Is that ok? 
Out of curiosity, why are you specifically interested in talking to aspies? 
One of my favorite post fight moments, [NAME] is a funny guy. 
Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off
What accent does the man talking in the video have? It sounds Scottish to me, but I'm just guessing.
Grammar jokes be* my favourite
Remember when he first got the ball this season and nobody cheered or knew him? Oh how times have changed.
Voting for someone to tax you to death makes no sense
Trade [NAME] and see if he plays [NAME] over [NAME]. let's see what kinda coach we're dealing with here.
Social norms that are immoral ought to be broken.
I needed this laugh like... damn. This comment is just as good as the OP and the OP is pretty amazing. üôå
So we should put all children in the school at risk?
That sounds like an appropriate response. Thank you for saving me the time.
But you ARE!
Both. lol
Oh ok sorry
I frequently have issues with these large temperature swing but it has to due with allergy pollen activation.
Midnight has been 4/4 pro league teams they have played so far, so I wouldn't be too sure they're gonna be bottom feeders
Children taken below decks by [NAME]. Get out now
"Wow....thank you...you just ""woke"" me up :) "
And it‚Äôs not like he was a bad coach. We‚Äôve been spoiled from all our great seasons.
Doesn‚Äôt even fit the sub either
Welcome to the gloaming. Yes.
Idk which is worse. The guy doing the project or me watching the video.
Absolutely love this song, up there as one of my favorite fav frank songs
Thanks. Timeless and eternal right?
YES CIZ so glad I saw this here, really well done, there is no end to your creativity.
The Angels should recruit him. (only a bit /s)
Id be pretty pissed if my prime didn't auto renew
Don‚Äôt forget me man, hit select before you hit start!
That's what makes the best reply you could paste the comment at mumble rap and 10 day tho.
WE'VE GOTTA GO BACK TO WELLINGTON
Yeah... THEY are the one looking for attention. This type of comments should be ignored. I hate troll comments.
I‚Äôm autistic and frankly this is disgusting. To say this about your child implies autism basically makes you worthless.

Some guys are gonna get their hopes up if you are at all young *or* pretty. You may attract less attention if you can avoid moving.
I got back at him, though. Him and that little boy of his.
This will pass and you will be stronger because of it
2 weeks! thats my dream!
Yeah, not the rich,that makes sense to me. I'm just commenting on the title saying billionaires are bad for democracy
Ah. I can't see that when replying in my inbox and didn't see his name the first time I checked here to read other comments
Great story, but I'm on PC and didn't get a chance to play ;c.
Their faces tho, LOL
Really funny how our FO liked the 2 of the worst qbs. [NAME] and [NAME] That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm skeptical about our FO now
Okay this is racist fear mongering. I got it now thanks.
Holy fuck that stop, good shit [NAME]
Nervous for [NAME]. He‚Äôs my all time fave. I wish he would stay retired and stay a legend
I fully agree. What works for one doesn't worth for another. Good luck.
This thread is a good indicator that Canada has a ton of racists who also love Reddit.

I make my cows super stronk.

Op literally listed the OS requirements. Those are fairly current operating (last Gen more or less) systems are they not?
Yeah that's not almost a semi auto. And the slam fire is vastly over rated.

Is she our girl? She makes the chapo bros and [NAME] cult so mad, I think she's the one I'm rooting for above all.
Brother please allow me to humbly agree. This is done. Take care of yourself.
Funny, but why do I care what his name is?
My DVR did the same thing as yours Damn them.
I love the 'Keep it simple' style! Hope mod won't sleep at this. :D
"So one person might have to ""improve their situation"" while another person's situation is fine, based on the opportunities their grandparents had. Right?"
This was a floating barge of bullshit bound to ignorance, which is headed for a recycle bin on my desktop.

Oh no [NAME] bb what is you doin?

How can they expect you to write if you can't read? /s
They will be more than happy to hand you the matches, followed by the cuffs. 
They do, however this is a TRAFFIC unit that focus' on TRAFFIC offences. Ice dealers are more of a detective / taskforce job.

I‚Äôm broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace.
This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
I had no idea. Is this recent?
Fair enough. Taking a break can be good. I wish you the best of luck.
Rest days or continuous cycle?
Pretty much. The key difference is that bunnies thump.

Also. Read the sidebar, thank you.
LETS GO BOYS!!
Starting super simple helps; compliment strangers! Nothing else - smile, compliment and keep walking your merry way. Hell of a confidence booster too 
That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?

Trading for Zubac is a pure tank move, he averages less than 7 points a game for his career. 
[NAME], I love science.
I live alone. Well, my dog... I do have to shut the door to keep him out. He gets too personal with his nose.
Congratulations on your relationship! I got a girlfriend too! She is imaginary right now but hopefully she will materialize soon enough!

Their pain is offset by the success they've had. We don't have anything.
I‚Äôm to scared to tell them :(
This is where [NAME] loan becomes a bad idea. I know he wouldn't start but now there's no backup RB.
As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.

The hooters waitress I hooked up with became a stripper. Now she‚Äôs engaged to her dui attorney who is 60
At least she'll probably die of her own accord, not murdered like [NAME].
Spending my first day ever in Europe. In Oslo, with an amazing girl I met visiting Texas from Norway about a year ago. 
Agree, she needs to learn to value herself. 
Everybody let‚Äôs join hands

Hopefully but I don't think it's going to change anytime soon
I gathered that part from the Boulder Barnes and Noble part. Was just curious if we were ever in the same ward.
Yep. That will do it. Glad to hear the message finally sank in. Rehabilitation is the key to fighting recidvism.
I‚ÄôM HOT ALL THE TIME :( pre-pregnancy I was cold a lot. This is worse.
That's a good step that can't be attributed to him because he didn't do a damn thing about it.
An uproar would be an escalation of his behavior and if he starts stalking me in real life or making threats.
Absolutely. That was an amazing set of games. Didn‚Äôt miss a beat
Gnarly ballsack is the technical term, I believe. Sadly, it's just a face beard.
Try not to cringe challenge.
I prefer console and most of my friends play cod. I still enjoy gbs every year
I‚Äôm from Ohio and I live in Wyoming now so I don‚Äôt find it weird at all.

Didn't know they sell pro bowl jerseys.
3 Hours of [NAME] pissing on the floor in public
They need more with more items because I've never been able to get same day.
"I kinda expected [NAME] to be like""Oh he's good? Ok bye"""

my parents did this to my sister who was just a tomboy because they feared she was transgender and now she is super girly and not herself anymore
My favorite parody in fact.
Guys his username is [NAME]. I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs serious.
the person in white is just wondering what happened
Problem is fornite kids are playing fortnite.
Yeah imagine if he had been as efficient as the beginning of the season. We would have at least 2 more.
Im curious, why do you think that?
No. It IS her condo and she CAN smoke inside her own home.
Go on...
[NAME] damn it [NAME].
Somebody is really insecure about their career decisions.
[NAME] damn it
It‚Äôs pretty clear UBI is not going to actually Make the character interesting. We should stop deluding ourselves.
UNCLE RADITZ IS PISSED!!!

Of course it was a huge hit for him. I hate people
You just found out your dog has a girl and a kid. How does it feel Grandpa?
Well, what I meant was that many people, myself included, consider masturbation to be immoral, regardless of its health benefits or harms.
Because it's scary, and therefore thrilling to face your fear. Also the shrimp are easier to catch at night.
i really don't get why people like this guy
WHAT ARE THOOOOOSE
For most people after 4 to 5 hours it gets up to the full resolution
Swear i have seen this before? had it been reposted?
Well first of all slurs
Possible Spoiler What about the [NAME] animation?

You really think the Senate and then [NAME] will sign this lmao?
Oh my [NAME] I almost forgot about the hot dr pepper in a glass glass made of glass

I want this feature just so I can get rid of the nasty rugged beige skins people have on their guns
Still one of the greatest gems that few will end up doing Smash attacks then the other big cities.
>both parties are dumb >stupid tribalism ü§îü§îü§î
The famous tank man. We know close to nothing about him. So I rather preferred to think he is living his life peacefully.
Just saying he could of said maccathy, kingsbury, or caldwell was his favorite. [NAME] had choices.
Thank you new best friend.
HOW DID I NOT THINK OF THIS
People who attack vigilantes.
And how often do you hear about feminists fighting for these women‚Äôs rights? Never. Feminists are cowards.
Less chance of complications and easier to get pregnant in your 20s. Assuming you are mature enough and prepared financially the younger the better!
I also got this on a different account, but I have no clue why! Does anyone know?
I hate y'all too
Our federal budget is $4 trillion. Until entitlements are reformed the arguments over what things cost is irrelevant.
My drunk gf found each sentence of this joke funnier than the last and is now covered in toothpaste
Cafe hopping today! At the third one now. Might be too much coffee for me in one span though.
[NAME], what? Why are you even here. Fuck off.
Really? I had no idea the bioavailability was the same
it's not hipster until you start calling it mylk, anyway.
John 3:16? What are you on about? Edit: also if this is the case then why is literally every genealogy in the Torah by father?
WHY [NAME]?
Yes. Or had trouble finding someone to sit by. Not many were interested in me.
I was about to say the exact same thing so I will add Review to the list instead.
it‚Äôs starting to get weird
He already did
Good point, it‚Äôs nice and frustrating for both sides I see. Definitely worse for the lower levels. That‚Äôs too bad
Of course I remember a time when I didn't know what calories were. I was a child.
Yea. That video is garbage.
100% rotation of troops.
Kinda like getting your RN. And, kissing your knees, back, etc goodbye.
[NAME] face was great the way it was üòî Hard to watch those first episodes of KUwtK seeing how naturally pretty she was.
Been sober this entire year. Still not sure what to do with my hands. Might become a cigar guy. Gotta tweak on something ya know?
Because making 44% of the team's total TD catches is not enough!?! Please tell me this is BS.
[NAME] probably knows him as the dude who brings him delicious chickens.
OH [NAME] I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE!
That‚Äôs what she gets for being anti-vax!
I'm 21. I've entered adulthood and I even have to face negative comments from family members. Adulthood won't save me.
"Said to my very white-looking brunette coworker once: ""Are you an oriental?"""
I'm sorry.
What's her name? I'm wondering if since it's being posted now years later Reddit might do it's thing and solve some crimes.
Yeh It‚Äôs pretty obvious how I misread it bc ... I misread it. I didn‚Äôt downvote you.
There are [NAME] fans on this subreddit. Awesome
pretty sure that [NAME] and those defenders of staunchness the vanguard bears run any of our mentalists pretty close.
Never go to the post office. that place is hell. pay commercial plus online and order every material you need.
That's so sweet, you have good friends. How old did you turn that birthday?
Men don't tend to have bags as big, I reckon
True. Here the mistakes has already been made. Please don't mess up for us who are looking for an alternative refuge to Israel.
Can‚Äôt hold this against Tennessee. [NAME] just won‚Äôt miss. I‚Äôm impressed that Tennessee has stayed in it.
FotC for life
Fuck ya boys let‚Äôs go
Yes! [NAME] was heavily involved in a murder. Why does everyone forget this? Now he‚Äôs all over tv and a darling.
There is nothing this Government could cut that wouldn't upset someone. Sorry, but weez broke.
This dude is acting like python is hard smh
Probably the thief trashed the place
True dat, I lost hope a LONG time ago

Personally, I think WebOS was the best until HP beat it to death. I loved my Palm Pre.
Oh sod off.

That's the funniest thing I've read. I would have had a hard time keeping back a chuckle.
Oh, sorry bud. Didnt mean to be rude
At least I can rest easy, knowing [NAME] isn't real 
My whole life‚Äôs been a lie
looks tasty did you all take it home?
ah yes, the RAMtard in his natural habitat...
Too bad such a scumbag of an organization gets to host the AFC championship game. NFL is thankful it isn‚Äôt the Chargers tho.
sometimes. not consistent with it though.
I love when [NAME] plays like this
Judging by this comment I‚Äôm sure women find you to be a real treat.
He also says something about waking up from a nap in his gameplay reveal calling it a ‚Äúpain in my ass‚Äù
I hope it all works out for you and your baby girl, its hard doing it alone but itll be worth it for her. :)
It is a very good opportunity for him to learn not to care so much about his hair.
I said stop though. What‚Äôs with right wingers and not understanding consent?
I wish I was there lol
You can find something sexist or racist or disparaging of some group in just about every movie or tv show.
Oh boy yeah
She doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate. That mug, ladies and gentlemen, is phenomenal

Not a problem! I feel for everyone of you ladies, and yall all my my sympathy and empathy. 
Love the [NAME]
You're entitled to your own opinion
This is so me! ‚ö∞Ô∏è
"I'd bet this guy is also one of those people that said ""not my president"" for 8 years when [NAME] was in office... "

i have this comic and I love this bit!
I bet he paid, AND requested this masterpiece 
> We're angry, but we don't want to be labelled as violent nutters.
Just save and reload. I doubt that when you reload you gonna stuck again.
True. I don‚Äôt know the story [NAME] is talking about. I was just clearing a perceived misunderstanding.
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not
just speculation at this point but it's not looking good
*youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*
The dad is a douche and the cashier seems like he just doesnt have social skills. I really dislike the dad more than anybody.
Turn yourself in, Jilliac scum!
Sorry was late at night and i was in a real depression fog
I know [NAME] is a great supporting coach as well, don‚Äôt know much about the other guy to be honest
He's alright, Avatar, The Happening and After Earth were genuinely terrible films. 
thanks [NAME], very cool! i‚Äôm just gonna off myself tho. brain hurty juice hurty my brain too much 
That's why I get my info from reddit, and use Facebook to keep in touch with the fam.
Thank you man whoever you are, this has really helped me. Best of luck to you too
Are you that guy everyone‚Äôs talking about? That guy at sleepovers who says ‚Äútechnically it‚Äôs today‚Äù at 12:01am?
I never really thought of myself as an ex-[RELIGION] until recently, so many no.
Except you haven't achieved anything. You inherited a lot of money and retired young.
[NAME] a pro
Thanks for posting that. I‚Äôd thought that I had seen all the Rice footage in existence. Good stuff.
As far as i can say, my precious arm came back to me hahahaha I'll be sure to tell about my progress, too! Till next time!
Watch your profits soar high as a crow!
[NAME] then. He gave the watch to him when he left.
Screaming at this reply
Where's your helmet?! Gotta love helmets.
GET IN MAH FEELINS
Why does everyone keep assuming that we‚Äôll suddenly sign big name FA‚Äôs? This is a terrible idea.
Fake news [NAME] never slips
Don't forget [NAME] 3 whole days as an esthestician (or however it's spelt).
No worries, good luck!
This is amazing to think about and love that [NAME] is there. 10/10
Careful, he's a hero
He's been doing it since Napoli tho.
Did you do the frame check by yourself or someone else did it?
Geez. The guy had a bad day over a year ago. Let it go.
The teacher apologised profusely, but nobody could hear due to the deafening applause. 
Yea man! Why does it always run out faster than shampoo from the same sized bottle?!
Eh my doctor isn't a GP. She knows her shit.
Id rather have native tribes have the opportunities than big business. And we really don't need anymore casinos anyways. Edit: in my opinion
This is cute.
They've actually gotten a bit worse :D Started with just a dry cough, now it's pain swallowing, stuffed nose, but the cough is now better
oh pigs arse ya cunt! if you don't say togs you're [NAME]
/s, you forgot this.
/r/ATAAE from my POV.
Ohh.. Thank you!
This is wonderful. Hope to have him and that newly a Dad joy back on ice as soon as he's ready.
Wow this is getting huge
[NAME] has towed the line of the Dark Side. He wouldn't cross it by doing something like this.
Good suggestion, he does a great job guarding [NAME] in their matchups
You should dm her and say I'm sorry
He has actively lied about and misrepresented Canadian laws and legislation, even after he's been corrected. 
That ESPN intro made me emotional üò≠
Stop master debating, you are making a fool out of yourself. It's concerning.
Clean your room, bucko!
I am starting to get very concerned with [NAME] and [NAME]
[NAME], I‚Äôd like to buy a letter A...
Great thanks for the advice!
Incorrect. To cure cancer you need to have a citrus and mint essential oils. Lavender is to calm yourself and help you sleep. /s
Then, why include any indication of gender or sex at all?
[NAME] was also a vice president.
HEY EVERYBODY ITS TAGGED AS A SHITPOST STOP CARING THIS MUCH. OBVIOUSLY WE‚ÄôRE NOT GETTING AD.
That arm flail of ‚Äúahhh stranger danger‚Äù cracked me up. Then sealed with a boop.
He missed out on a golden kid. You should be proud of yourself, congrats!
that's one amazing thought! All the best! we are with you!
Really bad trap if noone falls for it
I've wondered this too!
Yup. Soft serve turd special
I enjoy that general area. Sections 203-205 are good sections pricewide and view wise
Also upvoted. Karma always helps. Edit: thanks for all the upvotes guys. I appreciate your support
Thank you for the context. Everything makes sense now, I'd forgotten how... Certain kinds of people can be
Yep [NAME] and BIG for the next two seasons will be so fun to watch
Do you still have the video?
**LOVE TO HEAR IT B**
I don't.
Thanks, you‚Äôre right. I should delete the app. 
This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material
I've never heard of this place. I know what we are doing next time we're up there!
You're allowed to me a little mean here, no one will tell lol
I mean you got 1.8k upvotes off it so far
He acted like such a jerk- why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I would never trust him again.
[They've been abusing MPs there-- Facebook took down their

Pepsi tastes better in the UK than Coke but US/Canada coke is pure diabetes and Pepsi is disgusting.
It's a shame that anyone has to deal with that sort of feeling. I'm sorry that you had a similar experience. No one deserves that.
The Oscars at least banned applauding years ago
They have THE BEST tortillas too. Made right in front of you. Mmmmmm!
I'm disappointed by him not bragging about his 99 level atheism.
I don't understand how her hair is 'too light' or how that effects the concealer.
That's why I added the edit
I like [NAME]
So you are saying they are doing exactly what they are supposed to do with the money and hire people to work on it.
"What was the ""injustice?"" Nothing happened to him. Assuming his story was not hugely exaggerated to fit the victim card."
They're taking one for the team, those brave creatures!
I'm impressed. A 3 year old account and this is your only comment.
!remindme 7 months
Yeah, you can. I know people who've done it. Maybe not in your city? Regions do vary.
It‚Äôs [NAME]?!
Outdoor cats have a lifespan of about 5 years so allowing them outside is basically a prolonged death sentence.
if I told 11 year old me that brussell sprouts are a top 5 vegetables, he'd have laughed in my face
Nope, try to keep up.

Girls gotta stick together.
Hungover lil chicken
I love [NAME], but I'd trade him for equal time at equal cost from Trout before I took half a breath.
You know, I'm gonna say the n word.
It would be exciting I guess.
What kind of frankenshoe...
That guy who melodramatically dances around playing horribly soppy poppy chord progressions over and over and does a cringy dance that makes me want to kill things?
Woah so [NAME] was finally unhappy with the team? I sense a lineup shuffle coming
I love this wow
I've had sex with somewhere between 30-35 women, 100's of times total, since we've been married. Never cheated once. *Swinger things*

Man, I can still remember [NAME] playing for Texas
It's hard to be good to yourself.
Is it really pasta :)
Agree! 60 new shoppers in Columbus I think is why. I removed Chillicothe and all those once but they came back. I am not going there!
Omg so true üòÇ
Same here. Waiting for the doctor rn. Hope you're ok
This really feels like a jab at [NAME] as opposed to a reconciliation. Hope I'm wrong.
- But mom! I don‚Äôt wanna go to school today! - You‚Äôre going little shit.
Yeah odd, as those items would identify her. And it would seem like an easier job to burn them to unrecognisable remains. 
Your teacher was pretty cool for calling you snoopydog
Good bye job, and ever getting on a plane for that guy
Wow your metaphor is way better than the similar one I just wrote elsewhere in this thread. I'm going to have to steal it.
"I started a play about a man with tourettes and no fingers. Critics called it ""offensive and pointless""."
I can tell.
I liked [NAME]...
Ok, fair enough. From your original post, it wasn't really clear that you looked at sources other than YouTube.
$42,000 fine over a JOKE is unreasonable. 
That sounds delicious! Looks like I‚Äôm making a trip to the supermarket today.
Maybe 10-12 years ago lol
Palace please don‚Äôt fucking bottle this
Some reasonable Seahawks fans credit him with [NAME] development.
Even better, won't feel as bad eating the whole thing in one sitting then.
Um, excuse me? I'm a *rolling* rabbit hole, thank you
nope, this is just older people not understanding how teens actually communicate
There are millions and millions of girls in the world. You will find someone better, trust me
 I have worked at a shitty, south side smoke shop before so I can imagine all of these interactions perfectly hahahaha

I'm glad you're safe - but don't feel sorry for him. He knows what he is doing.
The truly sad thing is she's getting burned to legitimize Russiagate. It's a shame she wasn't a legit whistleblower.
Yep. They'll declare a national emergency and use army troops to seize all the plastic straws from chick fil a restuarants in the country
It's very hard to be an alcoholic drinking only beer.

My favourite commentator on this game
Sweet. This is the perfect article for my question.

Yeah, sorry, I was on the mobile site, and wasn't able to delete it.
well wj=h [NAME] allows evil and why he burns us..free will cant tmake sese from a god that KNOWS what will happpen
I‚Äôm dreading when it happens during our games for the title
it is actually called a mechanical bull
I'm so doing this!
And it‚Äôs always so uncomfortably awkward when someone says shit like this to you.
I have never had an outdoor cat. But I think the accidental death rate is higher than you're giving it credit for.
It's interesting but would be super impractical as a prosthetic for an amputee or someone with a limb deformity.
Have I been eating avacodos wrong this entire time! Oh no!
I would consider it a date! Plus dancing (ballroom) is intimate...hope you have fun and good luck!
No one to blame here, bad luck is what it is.
Who is this Wild team? Where have they been?
I dont get it.
Thoroughly entertaining.
It always comes down to not accepting who they are themselves so it's pretty much 100% of it.
I'm sorry. That's awful

Awesome!! Also, I have those same markers!
A lot of things men do *isn't* sexual harassment no matter how you feel about it.

Pretending to be a racist just to troll people is fucking stupid and not any better than actually being a racist.
I love this reply
I am glad I'm not the only person who noticed that bit of WTFuckery. ü§£
the fuck? I would do it in a heart beat. ya'll nuts if you think [NAME] will draft any better than [NAME]

The prevailing expectation is that Hulu will become 100% Disney owned in the future.
I feel like this happens to me every single time I shop there. I dont go in anymore because I'm tired of being followed.
Good point. Personhood isn't officially granted until you become property/ a bond of the state.
Does that idiot not realize he's roasting himself by calling [NAME] a bad lawyer? You worked with him for a decade, moron.
"""I'll leave I'll leaveeee!!!!"""

That's my plan!
I've got a mangina!
I mean just let it go and assume things aren‚Äôt going to work out. Drop it, so to speak.
I'm not trying to address the whole issue. I'm just trying to suggest that there might be unintended consequences that lead to even less public discourse.
Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It‚Äôs one thing to expose things but another to mock it.

Definitely bitter, lol.
It's the end of the world as we know it...and I feel fine
He wants to make excuses for his affair and I doubt you'll feel better after listening to him. In fact, you may actually feel worse. 
I agree with you here but I don't see how he is a sexist?
>there may be some toxic tendencies Everyone has some toxic tendencies, toxic is a pretty vague word.
it only flatters them when they‚Äôre posed a certain way. but other than that, it looks awful and uncomfortable
It's kind of worrying that you genuinely believe that left-wing people are actively trying to destroy their own country. Approaching USA levels of ridiculous viewpoints.
Good [NAME].
Where I live this standard, however they would of only been together just three weeks. Great news for you guys thou.
True. I just always enjoyed the atmosphere of that place. And a couple of the sandwiches weren't bad at all.
Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
I know people around here may mock me from my optimism but what if we get actual desings for the crusaders in Heroes?
If you look at her from a distance, she's super cute. Then you get close and it's a [NAME] painting of tweaky, delusion.
[NAME] dude I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
I was wondering what that was!
The description of the cut marks that KZ gave in MaM sounds as if a sawz-all was used.
I‚Äôm glad I had a few margaritas before I read this
Then yeah, not really. I can't think of a specific type of evolutionary pressure that would lead us to developing an ability like that.
Yeah for sure, they're too smart to go to class anyway, they've got time.
[NAME] didn't want to deal with [NAME] (reasonable) and [NAME] had more foreign policy experience and credentials than [NAME] did at the time.
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss... if you ever want to queue PM me for my steam
That was a great interview
Your comment is completely irrelevant and you're trolling me in order for you to cry and whine about Detroit. Get out of here.
>If you're not embarrassed they probably won't probe. I'd hope not!
Yes we do the want, need, wear, read thing already. Trying to get her on board with this will be like pulling teeth.
I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.
...*rip everyone who didnt go to college and instead paid your way through a degree which is hopefully a net return*
Oh they are. They just represent a large group of racist, willfully ignorant [NAME].
That's [NAME] btw in men in Black. He is also the actor who plays [NAME] in Netflix Daredevil. Such an amazing actor.
I **LOVE** that the players are finally getting into the game. People feel invested! I like that!
Alright we have worn them down enough guys.
This is **NUTS**!!! I still use both of these on my boyfriend, who thankfully watched this season with me and also hated [NAME]. 
Wow you found the answer, wish you were on top, will link to you in my post
Oh, I would refuse to do anything really nasty, with profanity or violence.
Finally! Somebody who legitimately hates planet Jupiter!
I see this guy all the time. It has a great vanity plate to boot.
If anyone deserves one...
I did. In a selfless sacrifice that I hope brings ample awards.
[NAME] for sure!.. just make sure you DO NOT get a new addidas one, get an old authentic one from the time frame he played
extra hot on whipped drinks? excuse me? i don‚Äôt want to burn my tongue on my CDL. extra hot on sauce-based beverages.
Those cards are so cool
You're right. Respect and honesty has never changed for me, though I realize that's naive
I watched the CWC from the stadium and boy is he amazing.
take care!! <3
In the end it is just another day surrounded by fake fans. If people wana watch a team that never loses they should stick to NCAAF
This post is SO HELPFUL. Thank you!!
Step back and think about your comment then delete it.
I find one at least one mermaid every 2-4 islands Sometimes 2 mermaids an island
no no no you don‚Äôt understand! personal responsibility means nothing! it‚Äôs all [NAME] fault! /s
We were all that way when we were 17 too
That's the best part, I can't even imagine to live forever with my shitty body
I hope. Sirens got me excited
Wow, way to be gorgeous as yourself!
It shows that the factors are so stacked against it that it must have been intentional.
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
What do you mean by gaps?
It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying.
I didn‚Äôt think about that side of it, thanks!
How is this news? I am sure there are a few living in discovery park and along the coast there
Who [NAME] should fight next after AB
Let it flow through you, become empowered by it. 
*Day after day, ordinary people become heroes through extraordinary and selfless actions to help their neighbors.* -[NAME]
My wife's birthday today, we are going for dinner with my lovely girlfriend later, after meeting at ours for coffee and cake. Very happy
How can I send it to you? I Just exactly recreated it in training arena
Also featuring the dat ass meme in the 2nd panel and the LOL rage face in the 4th. Both ancient but apparently still considered funny by some.
I was imagining her just coming in to work wearing the full [NAME] look.
It's also complicated because a lot of videogame media outlets quote him
I like taking 450 every 2-3 hours. Not the best hangover, but lots of CEVs and I enjoy the OBEs, floating thru the dark. 
This ain‚Äôt his first plank war
*Uh, I‚Äòm [NAME], I like penis in my mouth*
I find both [NAME] and [NAME] annoying each in different style.
"""oh.... alright"" [NAME]"
This list is phenomenal and your username is witty! I‚Äôm saving this. Thank you for posting it!
Well boys. I am going to actually be productive I think. [NAME]. You destroyed poor [NAME] spirit.
Female INTP and i concur! Especially the kids bit! And the Adorkable!
My wife has some crazy friends and I ducking love hearing their ‚Äúslutty‚Äù stories. The things they make these thirsty guys do is unreal.
5,280 homie. 
What about [NAME]? [NAME] I hate her.
That‚Äôs awesome! Heal up quickly
> Has WD-40 instead of blood [NAME] RBG would be awesome.
Im there as well, You get into these habits and become complacent its like your watching your life in 3rd person. For me that is.
The essay is optional.
Are u retarded
Wow. Some people are so stupid. But if it was me I would have opened the door and at least put it inside the doorway.
I still love Asian women. They will always be number 1 for me (exlcuding [NAME] of course)
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised one bit. He did beat up [NAME]. Maybe that gets him arrested and that‚Äôs how he loses [NAME]. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The sky is actually annoying and so on (and as annoying as it makes sense. No, this is interesting how?
That Thug had it coming.

Please don't.
"""This is a warning, there's a bomb in spar, we're giving you circa 100 years to get out"""
Thank you very much.
You crashed and burned but managed to save it. Congrats my guy
That's awesome!! Look forward to watching this kids progress in year 2
Be honest with her... or put her on a pedestal just high enough to see up her dress... ;)
What a weird thing to say.
I‚Äôve just said that both biology and social norms play a part? How is that me saying that there are no biological differences?
"Really love the ""Midtown Yards"" greenspace in the Mikyoung Kim design and also the Agence Ter design. "
>doesn't make a border wall ineffectual. As ineffectual as the TSA is, at least they can't be defeated by a simple ladder.
Thanks grandpa, it‚Äôs always good to see you around the holidays. That joke is hilarious every time!
There has been a lot of talk about being so open about it was her problem more than actually doing it. I'd call that defending her actions.
What a sheltered life you have lived.
Not my account. I do not own the [NAME] account on Youtube. Pretending I do is silly.
Haven‚Äôt seen that movie either, haha. 
Don‚Äôt have someone who didn‚Äôt wash their hands put in your contacts! Come on!
FOUR?!?!? that's inhumane and unreasonable. We get 10.
That guy‚Äôs heart must be more broken than [NAME] when he had the heart virus
A news source putting out sponsored news is inappropriate. Stop reading BBC i guess
I'm sorry for your loss. Also send a Mass card.
OMG. Indict this oligarch.
I really wish I could scroll through comments with the video still playing.. sigh
[NAME], but they all seem to be genuinely happy with their lives and supporting each other, so I‚Äôm happy for them too
Just remember some car insurances do not cover you for Uber/Lyft etc
Oh, I've thought about it... a lot, but I just couldnt do that. Even though he really deserves it!
I realize that, but the picture is still funny
Thanks for the lead. Ordered.
So you are the only occupant in the dwelling that drives?
I love Earth Balance, but does anyone know if the palm fruit is ethically sourced? I‚Äôve cut out palm products due to deforestation. 
I feel attacked. I can say just about anything in detail over the phone, but a simple hello email is so damn hard to write out.
Pretty torn about this post. Glad you made a friend but it sounds like you‚Äôre encouraging her habits and it‚Äôs not cool.
Thank you for saying so! I have loads more where that came from on my soundcloud.
Now this is a Contrapoints video I want to see
This is my favourite comment of the day. So because I don't like to be ripped off I should not be able to have a family?
Thanks for sharing. I'm afraid I will start to squint, this way. Not sure if it's the case. 
Thanks this was a cool article. The Shedd means a lot to me as it was where I went the first time I met the love of my life
Excuse you, rice is the best food. Rice is love, rice is life.
That's the spirit! Mah diggah... ‚õèÔ∏èüíé‚ù§Ô∏è
Definite Fridge Horror moment for that movie. That poor man.
Old Firm game also on the same day. Media won't care about the rugby.
He was transgender or wanted to be as well. Super rare case in a few ways.
M'excuse me?
This can‚Äôt be a thing. Is this a thing? It needs to be a thing.
That‚Äôs about all you can ask for these days.
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
I can say when I was 16 I never did anything even remotely as hateful as what these kids did. It's really easy.
[NAME] giving us an iconic HUH! HUH! I'm acting moment LMAO.
Glad someone brought that up.
Did you even read the post? Literally the first line says she doesn't do anything remotely house wifey.
sad that the Euphoric tipbot is no more
Seriously what?
Finally, we can put [NAME] down at the bottom like the EXP thief deserves.
I'm literally in tears right now. Everything you said is true oh my godddddddddddddd.
I just saw a post above this about people getting offended by jokes too easily
 üé∂ Hark to the tale of [NAME], and the boy he loved so dear. They remained the best of friends for years and years and years. üé∂ 
The co-worker thing is generally for the best,the rest I agree.
Happy Birthday!! It was great seeing her at the Royal Rumble and SmackDown.
"[NAME] hears bible verses and is like ""fuck this shit"""
"I hope he runs so he can lose decisively and we can get rid of this ""should have been him"" crap"
Karma ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ What a great example for us all, sir. 
Like thanks for your valuable input?
I think if we survived during The Blitz I think we'll be alright now.
is this sub scared to talk about [NAME] getting arrested
You gotta love the process.
Of fucking course it is...
"Ironically the fact that seemingly half the goons were inexplicably women was probably the ""SJW agenda"" this guy hates."
100%. Please ignore him. He's annoying af and survives off attention
But I'm a lodger, not a tenant, and I have no legal rights
Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.
We're so bad x4
Sucks that [NAME] was a straight positive in important minutes and hasn‚Äôt seen the floor since..
Could be to lead the police on the wrong trail to delay being caught
I hate to say this but I love the drama around this all.... idk. My life is boring
It's alright old man we're almost to your room
Great if your traveling abroad is limited or predominantly confined to the continent. Otherwise not so much.
dont care what you call it, just glad he's getting the job done. its what elections are about.
I couldn't be a god, I hate harp music.
Just make a better game looool 4Head You shouldn't worry about valve stop working on artifact, at least for a year
His delivery when he‚Äôs on just radio or a video has always bugged me. But his blogs are entertaining.
That helps. I would've never guessed you'd style mannequins.
Don't self-diagnose. Talk to a medical professional and check for known diseases that may cause depression (hashimoto's comes to mind).
Your funny, thanks
Hbxxx cc x CS t
Hope you're doing okay!
You can disagree with the West's policies and past actions without aligning politically with authoritarian regimes.
How many surprise Pikachu memes are we gonna have this episode? Like 6?
Okay, how?
You guys can‚Äôt stay married. Attraction is the most important thing if you guys actually think about attraction at all.
This does not sound like a good situation for a child at all imo.
I thought he was guaranteed to sign with the Padres lol
My bf uses profanity, and I don't care. There's no reason for misogyny though.
I love how it stops just before the impact
The issur obviously couldn't apply as they don't have free will, so I guess the tuma'ah is dependent on the issur.
what's heartwarming
Oh yeah. That character could have had potential if they let him develop properly
The claim that whole milk is 40% fat is surprisingly not the most absurd part of this picture. /j
This article and the accompanying photos have gone viral. Anyone who knows him personally has probably read it. Dude's probably being shamed and humiliated as we speak
True. I don't know the survival rates of the women in ancient rome but I can't imagine it was fantastic.
Dear diversity coaches: Maybe people wouldn't ridicule your profession if you stopped ridiculing things you don't personally enjoy?
This is such a good game so far from literally all of BIG. THIS IS THE FUTURE BOYS!
Nope but nice try. Nothing to do with the TH case.
Best picture of this I‚Äôve seen so far!
They didn‚Äôt even respond to my email so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna work
Yup, not enough money
Thank you. It feels better knowing that this is not an unheard of thing.
Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
Why not hit him up, maybe you can eat some chicken fingers (the good kind, 8 bucks) and then go bang behind the muffler shop
"I laughed at this post. Not because I find your pain amusing, but your casual use of the word ""boner"" kinda ruined the serious tone."
I like this one
"What is the point of this app? Not much is given on their page on the app store other than ""fun"""
[NAME] is insane! Better knuckle skills than any rider ever. I sure hope he has a speedy recovery from his crushed kneecap!
Oh, how I miss real spicy Chinese food. Day after, not so much.
Well damn, sounds more reliable then shit like and all that
These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.
Hope your surgery goes well and a quick recovery!
No, no. I love the ones where patients succeed. It‚Äôs not that. It just seemed like everyone phoned it in this time. 
If he can't cut his pubes he'll burn it
...a golden sex toy?
love how nobody decides to run over to him and help
Research #42 and also learn about our [NAME] Father, [NAME]. Get ready for a great year ahead.
In all honesty no slip shoes do actually prevent slips like 99% of the time. This guy just seems to be the unlucky minority.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
I was streaming on my laptop so I could watch the glorious win. Sadly hunting has been tough so far. Damn those Bison.
Family had a little to do with it
TIL I‚Äôm the only 34 year old that listens to rap music and everyone else listens to bands I‚Äôve never heard of
This is awesome. You can really see how little wasted motion [NAME] had‚Äîeverything looked effortless.
Awesome! Thanks a lot. Brings back memories
Women don't have penises so cannot rape by the legal definition of the word. They can sexually assault however.
I'm glad you're doing a bit better. Sorry about your grandma. Good luck.
Also Republicanism is a belief system. It's taught and handed down like religion. Conservative talk radio is its evangelism.
I hope this is better than The Middle I mean it's [NAME] so it's going to be decent at worst.
I will aspire to know the truth. Do not worry. and I will pray to [NAME].
Lol oooops!
Wow. You basically found my dream woman and gave her up.
Looks like we found his natural position.
Same.. First thought was damn that kids shoes

Thank you for this!
100% yes
This!!!! Just. THISSSS.
Yeah it‚Äôs the opponents club that should be scared of us! We are REAL MADRID!
Crows going to bounce back hard.
Guess Isco should never start then. I think opposite effect then
So that means the Vikings are the Purple Cobras...
[NAME] first event was IW, not last year. So you're comparing his second year playing professionals on LAN vs Cells first time. 
I heard about that too
I don't think my town has a market.
It's a yes or no question so no you did not directly answer it.
Like a football, one arm, head in your hand, body against your arm and don't fumble 
Sending prayers!!
[NAME] too busy picking his nose with his tongue to pick up that shitty pass?
I've been expecting that forever edit: gave up on that one
This stuff is very effective tho its weird smoking the quarter of a gram gets you going
Its a bit weird of them to recommend you a song by The Strokes after they told you their offer
Dammit, you know I proof read this and I thought it changed correctly but I guess it didn't.
Yes congratulations that was the joke.
Oh [NAME]. someone finally posted something I can't bring myself to finish reading, it's too much
Honestly this would fall significantly more in their capabilities of being witnesses from an Orthodox standard TBH
Pretty sure it's a rubber toy made to look like one
Sorry to hear that, brother. Why do you feel more lonely now compared to usual?
congrats on trying to correct american english with british english, two separate things
SE 89th just north of Brooklyn St is one of the worst I've driven.
Aww thanks :)
Yeah with this and the other thread DoorDash is definitely down. Just go home and don't answer any 650 numbers
You have been rewarded my friend.
Yes Thank you ! Someone might try to sue me because they pulled out and got pregnant ... use full body condoms if you think Facebook should support your baybeeees
Nobody's mad at incels for being in pain. We're mad at them for letting that pain calcify into hate.
Your x and his mother are the only other people there and you‚Äôve gotta work together to bake a cake.
Episode IX is apparently about [NAME] going back to Jakku
Less than 75 years ago my grandparents had swastikas burned on their front lawn in South Carolina after fleeing from Germany.
because it's a morning ritual and i like the smell and taste
I simply would not need a backseat driver to tell me what to do.
Why not touch them? then don't shove people out of lifts. that's hardly civil. just WAIT and let people get off.
I'm crying.
Can‚Äôt wait for the 2020‚Äôs in my 20‚Äôs.
I've not- I'll have to put it on my watchlist.
I saw a youtube video once where someone was a ‚Äúfailed abortion‚Äù. They were perfectly normal. I guess the doctor was just an idiot.
How dare the russian government expose the DNC and its corrupt behavior!!!!!
I do this when rolling haha
Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!
Deadly strike is also spammable with not costing brew and guaranteed damage. Personal preference bud, do the math
Some of them want to use you, some of them want to be used by you
And yet [NAME] can't even get a pub gig, homeboy was born the wrong colour
MUSK is just HITLER if you remember that: M=HI U=TL S=E K=R!
Stop spreading false hope!
Mine is when my husband says our daughter‚Äôs emphysema is acting up. No, husband. Her eczema is. 
I'm just really sad all that cake was wasted.
So glad for him, he's such a good man and deserves everything good 
She was! Her ‚ÄúBreathe‚Äù was phenomenal.
I liked going to the beach as a kid, but as soon as we were done I wanted that sand *off*. Wet sand gets *everywhere*.
Feed her poetry. But in a metaphorical way not in a weird way
Lmao. I still sing fun with the funk sometimes.
just like [NAME] was going to win by 90+%? I'm not going to believe it until I see it.
What‚Äôs with that woman waving not to record, thanks [NAME] for nothing!üëÄüòêüôÑ
It kind of replaces the home button, you use it to swipe up and out of an open app
Nor are they common in the UK. Never seen one in the middle.
"Not how it works for a lot of things. E.g. ""teach men not to rape"""
Watch your language, thanks bud
It's almost like the other commenter purposely misinterpreted the statement for a quick joke.
I feel like they missed a good opportunity to make the track in the shape of Texas.
Nah axe is ok
Yess! Some of my favorite lines from the trilogy. [NAME] killing joke monologue still seems very relevant today.
I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs being considered by teams. Can someone explain it to me?
I dont believe shit until america confirms the transfer.
I play around 2hs per day since launch. 1/2 Cuz I like the game. 1/2 In hope for a new expansi√≥n/fix to get the players back X:
!Messageme creepypost
I know he lives in Texas and I have his phone number and things like his name and age but nothing else really.
So long as we get the [NAME] from this season and not last season I'm happy
Images you can hear, ‚Äúoh my [NAME] laughter‚Äù
Walmart is also a good place to look at the local fauna.
I too rationalize how bad my my ex-girlfriend is now that she's gone. 8(
Just made some Ham and Lima Beans with those. You are very correct ...
I just guffawed at work. I hope your lawyer takes him to the cleaners.
Sometimes it makes me squint. It's fine with friends because they just think I'm high. It's not as great with colleagues and such.
Lol that‚Äôs incredible! PLO is such an amazing game, so much more entertaining than NLH. Good job pal. 
Are you [NAME]?
The register entries have allot of interesting information, and basically served as the record of service for all personnel.
Idk about you but I will accept my easy win if a Tiandi or Shaolin spam their 400ms lights
Dallas didnt play our schedule lol Even with VJ we could have beaten that team lol
She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL

I cringed and flinched. That‚Äôs a bad day
Skin starvation is a real thing. People can actually go crazy without social physical contact. Take care of yourself OP. *hugs*
i'm not that into shower sex tho. like it's fun sometimes, but it takes me so long to get off when i'm wet.
LOL that would be way better
The cognitive dissonance is strong with you.
The FBI has an age cut-off, so act fast!
That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
Yes had the problem a month or so ago but has since gone away
I completely agree with mondawggg. Playing the petty way instead of discussing the issue with him directly is so much more productive....wait
What a cataclysm
No because it's been a steady decline over 20 months.
U will hate it shortly
That poor kid. That is going to cause some issues for them as well down the road.
But seriously, you're probably going to feel very sick 
Why all the downvotes? It's a fucking pizza thread?
Upon reading I find this to be fake news and I'm disgusted to learn she writes for the age
The saddest part is that just this morning when we were laying in bed I was thinking about how much I love him.
Nice. Spotted it having a feed of quandong as well by the looks of it.
Suppressing anger is a horrible idea. You want to dissipate it in some healthy way, not bottle it up.
Before I processed what I was looking at, I thought [NAME] was [NAME].
Stop laughing at me.
I have a boobs but a penis, it‚Äôs quite the embarrassment.
There is one teacher, and 3 paraprofessionals. She is overwhelmed, and I want to help.
I loved [NAME] back in the day. He always seemed to pancake [NAME].
Fuckin' HockeyMod is almost as inconsistent as the Sens are.

Right. I'm gonna need to see some hog now, buddy.
Boy, I literally didn't expect anyone to respond to this. Thanks, internet! I feel a tiny bit less alone.
Twas delicious friend
Sounds exactly how it is - you don't want a relationship with this girl. It's pretty cut and dry.
This is a powerful mood.
I know this was a common thing, but never knew that were so many creative names for it until I read this thread. 
Watch out, [NAME]!! [NAME] is right behind you. Oh god oh fuck he can‚Äôt hear us, he has AirPods.
On [NAME] I‚Äôm in Alabama [NAME] pay what you pay and get 179Mbps down smh
Ahhh, [NAME]: Hero of Eardrums worldwide!
Oh dear, you are entertaining. Please, talk more to me. 
It'll be the first game of the day!
Why not though? Not enough buyers?
sorry, i phrased that wrong. i meant that as a asexual, i get that a lot
I believe so
Pizza time!
I'm about to start my weekend. Don't mind if I do go contribute to the thread. Thank you, OP.
And the ability to get time off for all these trips
Oooo I love that theory! I hope we do find out her name one day
"Good lord, do you not remember ""Thanks Obama"" where everyone fake blamed [NAME] for everything bad?"
You‚Äôre a moron. That is called extortion and it is a crime here in Canada. [NAME] would have been locked up within hours...
I'm impressed! After childbirth, I'm lucky to make it twelve minutes without having to pee...
Me but with boobs. When will be able to trade body parts [NAME]
Fair to say I won't have to pay pipebomb 10ETH. Happy New year, all!

Sure hoping so!
yup - he threw [NAME] under the bus with no guilt
"I love the need for HAES and setpoints and special illnesses in normalizing fatness - because it's not like they can comfortably label marginalization ""gluttonophobia""."
Some dank shit DEFINITELY happened at the Ritz back in the day.
Vasectomies are fairly common. Especially in older men.
Would the OP care to explain what the thought was behind posting this here? A warning for justification for potential upcoming gun-control responses?
Is that proving Jewishness for Halakha or for the [RELIGION] Agency?
Always love me some Rambo. Sure he's not as charismatic as Ox or Jenko but there's something so earnest about him.
Only 22? Weak.
Yiddish is such an in-group language that you basically just have to go by whoever you're talking to.
This is funny though.
Things can be a little bit true, you know. It isn't all or nothing. Do you consider yourself a skeptic, by the way?
Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
time flies so fast when you're 18. i didnt expect id turn 30 and still a virgin. hah
I love how the dog bites hard enough to pull it away, but soft enough to not kill it
Could not agree more. Personally, I love watching any comp at pro level. GOATS is fun to watch the micro play and ability timings and synergy 
Yes i hope things go well for them
I feel like I‚Äôve had this exact same conversation with a customer at my old job.
Thank you, really. I always thought so, but it‚Äôs nice when other people see it too.
This just isn't true. It was before [NAME] prime.
[NAME] is creepy about nearly everything, but the way she is so possessive over [NAME] is super uncomfortable. 
Can you link this somewhere. Im not too sure what you are referring too.
GIVE ME OTHER PEOPLES MONEY!!!!!
but the question is if they want to rapidly increase their volume. Maybe they're ok with current state of things.
> Imagine the ~~nightmare of regulation~~ flood of unregulated money these guys are up for- congrats.
Before telling you anything....what exactly do you want out of this?
I meant that you're funny, not that you've got a weird life
Um, this department already lost the suit, so they can feel free to admit the wrongdoing and apologize.
Bay Area, sorry ;D
Wow, this is bizarre. Well, I agree too. A wealth tax is exactly what we need.
You mean the best.
Your part of the problem why autism isn't taken seriously
Oh wow, cry me a river. It's not like he's testifying against a [NAME].
I don't just cringe, I feel literal embarrassment for anyone who has watched it.
Yes, however I did misquote the study, however I've corrected my OP 
I think men take pockets for granted, once you're without pockets you'll understand the pain. 
I mean you could be one or a combination of those things, realistically. -_-
Except they fucking awarded it a prize first. It went through vetting, beat the other applicants, won, then was removed as not being correct?
Thanks, I hate it. They're out now though.
Yea can get a pic of me and my mates when we go out for drinks next So don't bother trying with jokes? Just keep it empty?
I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
Lol at the caption, but I believe it‚Äôs Netflix‚Äôs new original movie Close.
Before 2014 there wasnt a single polar vortex....oh
If you want an OG Dragon Ball rep then throw in Roshi
Not sure about [NAME], but I think [NAME] would win easily against [NAME]
Pfft. That's awful of him and her. They deserve each other then. Grab your shite and gtfo. Hope he enjoys his fog and dysfunction.
Most of us think it‚Äôs just a conditioning thing right now, but we don‚Äôt really know
That's great! You got this!
Hey beautiful! Glad you had a great time!
She gets genuinely emotional sometimes too. I love it. So refreshing
BUT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM LIKE TWO SECONDS TO HELP HIM GET OUT REALLY!!! This show makes me angry sometimes.
This guy doesn‚Äôt physics.
Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. 
Guessing the bra sizes of anime characters after having stared at them for so long... That's... an interesting hobby.
That's wild. I was just at the DIA last week.
At least things are looking up with the next generation. That optimism sits in stark contrast to this news.
"I dunno, I'm picturing completely beige and generic baby shower. Beige streamers and balloons, a banner that says ""there will be a birth""..."
Yep that was incredibly rude. What kind of adult sits down and decides to put that in a major magazine? Just unbelievable.
I don‚Äôt fucking care
Good stuff [NAME]
The goodest human
It‚Äôs a shame that the name of the man doing the kicking is lost to history.

Ok bud. I guess I havent been living my entire life with asthma and have 0 idea about this.
Shhh don't give them the idea!
I use Firefox with my 5 extensions and one tab, 400MB of RAM being used. I use Chrome with the same conditions, a whole fucking gigabyte. 
I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.
God damn I miss this game!
I want to know them - so I can actually murder them. (With words, that is.)
I never will understand the reasoning behind puking in a toilet... Perfectly good bucket right there.
It keeps more people employed that way.
Love this!! This is so lovely! Wish I had friends like this! Great drawing as well!!
How long do you think manga will go on? Its fairly long now at 216 chapters and I think it's in it's late stages.
I dont think self-sources work for TIL.
^^ a better idea
The stuff nightmares are made of. Those poor poor timelines.
I'm gonna say that I hate Randazzo's because of their terrible icing. Haydel's is decent and ships.
I feel personally attacked. Every time one little thing happens, part of me just collapses inside.
I believe the mentally ill are the ones that spend so much time and effort caring about what I do with my own time and money. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
This sounds a bit fishy
Why is it embarrassing?
Are you really Belgian cause I love it
Haha I've never seen a BritSovcit video but now I'm gonna have to check some out
She's as tall here, in giant heels, as [NAME] is without shoes so I'm betting on not tall.
Keeping [NAME] was a great decision. What are you even talking about!?
Played Divinity as well. Is Atlantica what I was describing? If so I'll give it a shot indeed. Is it still alive?
Oh poor guy. That‚Äôs so sad. I can see why she is an ex friend.
I made this a 41 from a 42, so satisfying!
I never had a problem with the old parachuting mechanic, but I like the new one and I think it might actually be better.
Definitely didn‚Äôt give [NAME] a huge scar
Now let‚Äôs go [NAME], beat PHI so the Saints can knock the Rams out next week
HEY! NO OC IN r/ComedyCemetery
OMG, I thought the same
I feel like [NAME] would have laughed at it though. It was a one-liner. I thought it was funny.
The Palmer Report makes up crap and spreads conspiracy theories. We shouldn‚Äôt be promoting this guy, he‚Äôs just playing to our biases.
Which is weird because it also looks like dog treats
No, you can shoot farther but the scoop only allows you to range out to 1 Klick at the last hash marked 10
I can try. That sounds interesting. Its hard for me to not be interrupted at my house too. But ill definitely try.
Your brother is in a freak cult that ruins lives. Forgive him but don‚Äôt listen to that bs.
This is genius. The ultimate prank.
All good brother. Los Lonely Boys just came on and I'm jamming. Much love.
Look I also love dragons, but this is just not a dragon, ok? Have some Toothless *hugs*.

It's 57% upvoted, which pretty much means most people hate it. 
Congrats and good luck moving forward!
Braves clubhouse report podcast says don't write off [NAME] to the Braves. Podcast removed from my subscription list. Lol
The people who announce this early only mean to shape the conversation. We can measure his influence in dollars until a smaller subset of nominees take the lead.
Good time to reach out to the wife with this screenshot and ask her to please stop...
‚ÄúI use to work here and I remember our policy was this!‚Äù Did I nail it?

Do you have proof for what you said scientifically and mathematically ?
I agree with the last statement but apparently I'm also bad at matching pokemon to rep :(
finally, a game to watch
Why thank you
I saw it when it was at the Mackintosh Church in Glasgow, it‚Äôs pretty impressive. 
I had a blast watching it and am glad you did too!
Wait what? I don‚Äôt get it?? Help.
Cancer is even scarier my friend. Let's just hug it out
great ideas!
Thanks - I had not heard of shootings in chapels.

I'm 27 and still look 15. When does this change?
No he‚Äôs played his first season at center then finished as the starter at right tackle for every year after.
He does look old. Could just be a poor rendering because [NAME] doesn't look so good either.
Hey I hope you know you‚Äôre still important and loved even if you may not feel like it at times. You‚Äôll be okay!
>Downvoted for sharing an anecdote, great subreddit this Sharing blasphemy about the [NAME] emperor is punishable by downvote, heretic.

If he does well, do you guys think that's a sign that we could flip a senate seat? I like [NAME] a lot.
Felt like yesterday when they got married in that barn/bar/bistro. Truly the halcyon days.
Haaaahaaaahaaaa! Been there. I had a little kid do the [NAME] handshake on me. I just looked confused.
Oh [NAME] I forgot all about this site for good reason
I don‚Äôt believe the mislintat or the big joke parts
I blurred the names of the others it's about [NAME] being [NAME] üòÇ
My fur son was the first I came out to. Most important also

What is your career field? Maybe you should take a break or something? Beating your head against a wall every day has to be frustrating.
Vans are ugly as hell. You just cant make a Minivan look mean. Also why are they trying?
Question of the century.
Tinder is for sex. You want husband material look else where.
Especially the Lexus peeps. Just baffles me how they dash in their nice cars.
How dare you, she's in your flair too!
"Has he recieved ""Consent of the Congree? Don't deflect, that was the Constitution not CNN. "
[NAME] helped by hosting with her 12k? viewers from the drop event. But yeah, overall the viewership has increased in general. Which is great news.
If your friend ever decides to go public with their content, make sure to let us know. We're more than happy to promote them. 
This is one of my favorite of [NAME] songs although all of them are really good. Either beautiful of funny all of them

HHahah. Right? I‚Äôm scared

Too cute for me. Why cant i have a boyfriend *[NAME]*
Ah, fair enough.
So many. [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] (with her eyebrows), [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] are some of my favorites. 
Yes! Wonder how tall the girls will end up üòÇ
People still do? I thought everyone realized how overpaid he is
Haha its okay!
Pretty sure their subreddit makes one of these for every game. They're pretty legit.
But her cancer the second time was caused by the chemo! /s
It‚Äôs crazy that people know this and yet rake [NAME] over the coals for not wanting to talk to [NAME].
So as the Iron Islands and that doesn't make them more commited.
Oh, because his sideburns were shaped like stars!
Ahhh more and more selfish
"It wasn't about your syllable count. It was about how nobody ever calls it ""text-interpretation."" It's called ""reading comprehension."""
I don't like it but it also makes sense. If [NAME] headlined a deal with the Mariners for [NAME], I'm all for it. 10000%
I really like the colours but I'm wondering where that bit of shadow on the chin comes from.
Love their king onion soup! Such a gem, also they have good local wine there
I want to see him succeed. Mostly because his last name makes me think of the bad guy from Shrek
She called someone from RHONJ a r****d and then doubled down in a particularly petulant manner when someone called her out
Two are close friends of mine one of which has not been higher since October to December 2016.
Surely a ferry could be more cost effective and fun than that.

That sentence should be illegal.
[NAME] is my least favorite out of all of [NAME] love interest (In all live action movies) Bite me.
Aw thanks!!!
Let this be a lesson at how easily manipulated some therapist are. Block the therapist immediately. He/she has been compromised by a psychopath.
It wouldn't interest me at all, unfortunately.
To be fair, it might have been dislodged during the earthquake that was weirdly in sync with your music

Your friend must have had a horrible time writing papers if adjectives like that were off limits
UN report says population before war: 300,000 [NAME] population before war: 2,000,000
What a greedy person. 8 years jail and hopefully disgraced out of his profession.
I love the fact that [NAME] kept the nose thing for so long he had a mark for the rest of the episode
Haha love it
you say that because you think [NAME] is innocent
Maybe [NAME] would rape you too if that makes you feel better
Hulu is awful for this. The volume on their commercials is deafening.
I am hopeful that it will win the Oscar for best animated picture and renewed interest will lead to more 3D screenings.
Bloody Peasant!
I‚Äôve seen 62 to 8 in 12 hours up north. Weather is crazy stuff.
I think this is the clearest that it has ever been described. Thank you for this. It nailed it, for me anyway....

You didn't like the joke? I thought it was an instant classic.
Depends on who rates you. They don't all do it. I stayed at 5 till about 40 delivery, then it started moving around alot.
I was just a little disappointed that there is no audible/visible reaction by the character when visiting the graves (also trying to avoid spoilers).
I always thought he was a student that took school too seriously (when I was younger of course)
Doesn't look like any 12 year old I've ever seen.
Can't let it get to you. You tried, got rejected, so move on.. Believe me I know it's discouraging but everyone gets rejected. 
Welcome to the depressed group
That will have to be MY cake then!
I really love that game. It's so chill, I played it a lot. 
I fell like labels like genderfluid agender ect reinforce the idea of gender and gender roles when we should be trying to get rid of it completely.
Not journalists...media activists.
ok i noticed the eyelashes but the rest is really unnoticable
I promise you it would for most people. You're just spoiled with having the mountains 45 minutes away.
The guy who thought of this chokes the chicken.
Goldfish are awesome pets, they are cheaper to replace than they are to feed! :D
I'm just an idiot on the internet. I don't know a doggam thing.
It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
This comparison pic kills me! Stassi looks like a California Raisin!!
Can you give a source for that? I'd like to understand better.
You‚Äôre going to love it. Wake up refreshed and ready
The unfortunate thing is that, right now, that **is** how it works in politics, it‚Äôs just been made extremely obvious the last few years.

Yes!! My favourite film - I came here to suggest it, too. 
this is my favorite scene from girl with the dragon tattoo
Something being blatant doesn't mean another action isn't as blatant.
Wait...what?
Personally, I thank the half hour that wake up thread existed for this W
Got boomhauer(?)(boom-how-er) pretty right tho his character was apparantly a [NAME].
I love you too, no homo.
A horrendous amount of Sesame oil, god, that would be awful.
No its not, a AGM can do damage in excess of 15m$.
I definitely get that vibe from this post. Or [NAME] was friends with them and didn‚Äôt get invited to the party lmao
‚ÄúLol that‚Äôs Sammie coates replacement not minds take it how you want to I am back‚Äù- [NAME] - AB
Holy crap. I need to listen to that speech in full on my commute home then.
Is it survival? If so I'd love to join!
How could you ever get bored of place that is getting more and more enjoyable as you are there
You get her off 3 times and she doesn't finish you? That seems very selfish.
That's my secret, cap. I never had any. 
I like being bad. It makes me happy.
Yep happening to me all the time at my college. Fuck everything
Our love is like, a violent game between children baby.

I can feel his cheeks puffing out.
I honestly don't know much about them at all, but hey, I'm young and I don't know everything yet, so.

That is amazing! Congratulations! Such a great news!
I've been a libertarian on this sub since I joined reddit 3 years ago. This is either my first or second most commented sub
And best of all, it is giving a child a loving home.
Not that I fully disagree but this seems a lot more like a rant that you want people to back you up on rather than a genuine question.
She has a dirty mind perfectly fine looking cannon until she manifest the awkward scenario.
Yeah suck it, California

Too easy. I‚Äôm selling at $18k on Jan 12, 2021 so I can be pissed at myself for not selling the top
Hard to describe, but I get a more relaxed sleep with cbd.
No I'm saying you can't love someone else if you don't love yourself. ...
Uh huh hyuck!
i love [NAME] and [NAME] so much, but... [NAME], my dudes.
"I dated a girl from Broomfield Colorado. She'd end sentences with ""yo"". I ended us."
An especially large comfortable shirty [NAME] wear. It's annoying though because people get jealous of how comfy you are so they climb in your shirt.
That would be rough my dude, cops are trained to aim for center mass.
I'm not having any thoughts that are safe for me to publicly type.
BY [NAME] THAT'S [NAME] MUSIC!
You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!
Thanks for the info mate gonna watch out next time
The whole paper ballet thing makes tampering a non issue.
Justice for that horrendous no call
I wonder how [NAME] prepares his food.
In foreign policy terms we're no better than Russia. We're guilty of everything they are.
I'm glad people with such foresight are the first to find this place unaffordable. Good riddance.
"""Don't worry honey, I'm not drunk. ... Of course I'm not cheating on you!"""
Lmfao, so true. 
[NAME] is a vile excuse for a human being and a stereotypical, alt-right, [NAME] supporter.
Again.. lolz.
I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt, this is very much weighted in the Magic‚Äôs favor.
The way his head snapped up, it looks like she caught him on the chin. That would also explain why he got knocked out.
Who else thought [NAME] looked stunning last night
Ew. Being raped is not getting laid
Good job shining up your spine and telling him it's over! Your life is going to get so much better with him not dragging you down.
I did it to myself, I knew he slept with multiple women...I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking
I take issue with the word probably. If you don't have faith why are you even here?
Made me think of that video from the BBC about dating in Shetland .
Thank you! I‚Äôll give it a listen tonightüòä
YUP. I‚Äôve been healthier since the new year FINALLY smh
I‚Äôm worried about [NAME] too
It's pretty stupid. Yes
I like it. It reminds me of Aphex Twin but I also hear modest mouse melodies and rhythms. I'm a fan of both
I would love to know the Governor'sr's response to that line!
You ladies are awesome. Thank you all so much for your kind words.
Me and my babyboys safety word is Obama. But I like yours too.

Oh they can make numbers up too , good idea. Astroturfing starwars, this is the worst timeline.
Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
Yup. If they're brazen enough to not give a damn about the law, they're brazen enough to not care about public opinion on them.
First- damn what a block Secondly- that was a really smart timeout there. Expected a prayer shot.
OMG kids are dying from polio??
I have no faith, but the theodicy problem has multiple answers, I‚Äôm not too concerned with it.
I dont go because it ends 1 of 2 ways. Either im sick or im not. I dont like either of those answers.
Thanks! Very cool. It was a marriage gift, so that explains some of it. :)
Thats just dumb, u are stealing from people that just want to live a good life cuz other were unlucky, they were also unlucky by being born.
Boy I hope someone got fired for that blunder. (honestly I thought of messing up this quote just to screw with you too)
I had [NAME] from this post. And that's whats important.
It does indeed. üòè
I love this kid.
Thank you for the vote of confidence, but this experience has really effected me
The scorpion one on the swing set looked so bad. I think I heard her back break/crack.
Forthwith this group will remain unnamed, verily so that we might avoid bringing ire upon ourselves for a simple observation.
That's great!
I'd start off wonder trading til I found an adorable frog the size of Fyre need unimaginable financial backing.
Now that I‚Äôll need to see some evidence for.
It was heavily implied that [NAME] would plant the billion trees personally. I feel totally misled by Labour.
I am mad as hell nothing is being done on her crooked ass her and [NAME] both. LOCK HER UP. LOCK THEM UP
Not really, I‚Äôm not too sure, thanks for asking 
[NAME] has stated that he's open to decriminalization. It's up to the legislature at this point.
I think [NAME] said it best. When two people watch the same video and see completely different events....there's no fixing that.
yeah but FUCK devil roar. I swear a volcano happens every single time I step on land there
Oh! Thanks for clarifying. The entire time I thought it was written by a child to their OWN parents. I'm thick.
Shameless karma whoring.
"If we get past the ""scraps"" problem I might lose interest though cause then I'll have plenty of stuff."
[NAME] sucks. Rally killee
Ahhhh [NAME], you‚Äôve done it again.
Was he rejected because of his methodology or because of the content of his studies?
BAT OLA?

Thank you. I needed to hear all of this. I appreciate it.
Interesting, thanks for the article, guess they're just as bad!
Wow, that was insane
we got good at breakaways!!
Why would someone need a year to respond to your needs? Don‚Äôt waste another moment.
Oh, I see. I must have mis-read that. I am sorry.
Lmao what an end to a quarter
It is really boring. There is a culture in church, but it is essentially soulless and is really only weirdness with a heaping of superiority complex.
12 is ambitious!! I‚Äôll do this with you, but my goal would be 4 
 looks unreal, like it's a toy or something.
Fucking Real Madrid
Got home from helping my friend move and turned it on literally just in time to see [NAME] score. Let's go Knights!
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who was pedantic enough to notice.
I guess 14 years of customer service experience is good for something after all.
[NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected
This is amazing
maybe it's all [NAME] fault
He really likes racism
I like them
Love that lane. It's like the best part of Rome.
And [NAME] would never cheat, either! For shame!
Oh. :[
Much more badass than the union suit.
Imagine [NAME] ever saying this.
I completely agree, someone would take a flier on the kid.
fucking melb transport. I knew it would go to shit today because of the heat wave, and it did. the only bad thing about this city.
(i'm tickled to see the tag Kalamity catching on around here)
Hey, me too. Good luck tomorrow 
The point is still moot tho so whats it matter
You are gone right now probably my trip is just kicking in i took half that amount lol cuz im low you are having a hell of a ride rn
Lol! But I love your last name though. XD
My problem with history in school is we learned about American history every year, which meant we learned a lot of the same stuff over and over.
I can't even get close to beating that one though... same with the salmon fishing one.
Are you having a stroke? Do you smell toast?
Happy Cake Day! :)

Please dont put words into my mouth.I never said rape isnt a problem.
I'm not ready for that so I won't believe it
No, but I might choose to not support certain teams because their owners are trash.
No pick and roll, this is a nightmare without [NAME] and with [NAME]
Thanks kindly!
okay but i need a strategy on how to deal with this
Canadian [NAME] here to disagree with you. Politely. Sorry.
I already told him off and typing the number into Facebook came back with a whole bunch of nothing.
They were spewing GOP talking points, not totally shocked since they are Republican Lite after all. Smh.
Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life...
I think you overestimate the ability of politicians to rig the vote c.f. May 2017
My neighborhood is majority Haredi dude. Getting upset when a minority moves in is bigotry.
She has been.
[NAME] was actually asked whether he‚Äôs peaked by a Philly sportswriter last season. His response was pretty interesting:
I'm torn. I watched it twice, but only twice. Also, I didn't check the sub until I saw the comments. 
This is super duper nasty
Just why? No one is going to want to eat their food out of it and placing something on it is pointless
Who cares about the Super Bowl anymore. Can't wait to check out this XFL league...
Being demoted for having the best ideas in the office doesn't sound like a good business strategy.
Apparently Sim groomed a 14 year old girl.
I need to present on how birds are not real. THEY ARE NOT REAL
I was only thinking of the players that were drafted. [NAME] is a UDFA GOAT.
[NAME] that was me
Firemen make roughly 30000¬£ in UK today.
He is just the exception to the rule though.
That looks lovely, but what‚Äôs the mutant on the top?
his traps hide the fucking sun.
I'm enjoying the witty comments but anyone want to throw in some analysis?

Ask their jock size in response
Bruh Nicollet Mall is downtown Minneapolis. There‚Äôs nothing suburban about it.

I‚Äôm gonna do lsd again in 2 weeks

I mean.....I know far more people who dabble with things like alchohol, weed and psychedelics than I know who are weekend warriors with opiates....
This is why I clean my belly button every day. That‚Äôs disgusting
Especially funnier whens its commented on a song from like 2004.
Big ups. The small things make the difference.
Idk, looks more like [NAME] to me, the fact he goes straight in for the hug is what sells me
Got one, it's still bad dude
Its like the other 3 teams are moving the [NAME] cube until it matches and they can be affective against the Patriots. Still not quite there
They don't mean it hurts they mean it's just bad and awkward. It can feel good but is nothing compared to sex with experience.
I don‚Äôt think so. The rest of her profile was completely serious. She had photos from art museums and discussed politics in her profile.
Oh [NAME] why does he have to drag green day into this
At least this makes me feel better about not being photogenic. It‚Äôs the cameras fault!
I know, that is why I said that. 
SMILE BY [NAME]
I have an older set by what looks like the same artist. They look identical just with a few different players.
Yes!! It took 6 months to get my license in! I started to worry that something had gone wrong, but, I indeed receive it!
Makeup can be expensive! Even though she got her makeup done now, she will have to replace those that she lost
Never, ever, ever, ever double text. Pursue other girls after the first text is unanswered.

When you open Boost for Reddit in dark mode and you're greeted with this post
Life is nothing but a hell filled with torment, misery and loss.
Why,? It‚Äôs natural. That‚Äôs weird af.
I think I'm kinda the same way like I change up so much everything I say feels like a lie... See just did it again. Fuck.
[NAME] advisors did the same.
I don't know what the main broadcast is like, but the MNF crew is amazing.
You stole this
Can't even put on dress pants now without turning back and checking for my parents.
I would have liked this period to go differently.
Where does this one person every 67 hours statistic come from?
Thanks! I had a more standard name but then realized I didn't want to be findable on Reddit.
Probably, I knew this lawn chair was a bad idea.
You mean I shouldn't be doing treating it that way now?
That's awesome. You are a great and good person with a good heart. Never, ever change‚ù§
Gotcha. That can happen sometimes too but make sure you follow up with your gyno just incase.
No, the ECJ made unilateral A50 revocation subject to good faith use, not as a tactical tool to gain a better deal.
she once had a one way 30 minute conversation with me about how she and her boyfriend met while I was holding food what do you think
I can‚Äôt tell if you got the joke or not hahaha
I really liked this but holy shit I miss my AR shots compared to like 1440 or even 1600
[NAME]
nothing specific. it varies. it's rare.
"No, because I don't have to. This is an ""Everyone else"" problem."
You beat me to it!
I got bit by a Pomeranian while doing a dash...
Oh I know lol I overdid it w that comparison. The point is singers have shit vocal nights but that doesn‚Äôt make them unprofessional. Shit happens.
Naaah, that is and always will be [NAME], especially since her redesign in MKX. perfect waifu.
"I might be a prude. ""Suck him off in the bathroom of your friend's home!"" Those don't equate"
Uhhhh I did lol
Fat dont fail me now!!
Yes, especially if it's a party being held for someone who's older than newborn No No
Fascism doesn't even exist in America. [NAME], these kids are so sheltered. 
LOL watch this with the Raptors' commentary:
It would hilarious if racist attacks against [NAME] propel him to the PMO.
Yes, but shockingly that was the first post of hers I‚Äôve read in years that didn‚Äôt make me want to claw my eyes out. 
[NAME] just put a huge hole in my heart.
I don't understand what he's asking nor do I understand to who it's aimed at. someone explain pls
"Do people really not get over bullies and have to make up stories about ""righteous revenge?"""
It's disgusting how good our teams have been both years until december happens. It's usually started by injuries too.
Dude, I'll be your friend any time. Especially if you got Steam/discord. I will link u to our friend group's server.
It's different when it's your younger sibling, people 
Those hours are hours better spent railing against the bigger polluters. You shouldn't sit on the back of a whale and fish for minnows.
Call him out in person? Or in front of someone.
Love the place but be ready to wait. They really do take the time to make sure you look good and fresh.
My favourite series are House Party and A Way Out. The Sonic comics episode is a golden too.
Welcome home!
We‚Äôre a bunch of northerners so that‚Äôs basically the norm.
You only had to look on the side bar for those and many more.
Thanks for pointing them out, it's hard to see through my tears üò¢
This is beautiful and heartbreaking :(
I‚Äôm offended that your offended
My own worst enemy singalong is my favorite LOL
He makes Talking Thrones look good.
Thanks for the advice!
[NAME], I hope your plot armor is strong enough to save [NAME] from a ship crash.
Respect for the homepod I got two of em. Arguably bit overpriced but it‚Äôs an amazing product
Everytime I see something in this sub that looks sharp, I get very worried. 
Good to know üòä
[NAME] was arrested for lying and obstruction, to FBI not collusion, calm down lmao 
"I love that! We need a ""We have cookies"" line for her, now!"
But at least you know where you stand with a restraining order. At least 1000ft away.
Is it weird if I said I forgot how brutal things could get? Like what happened to [NAME] oh my-I was appalled.
Wow...Mean [NAME] passed away today. RIP
You wont be sorry, look me up.
I like you.
Spent time with them. Argue with them. Laugh with them. Cry with them. We all get lonely when we are old.
Additional space race
Kinda looks like a boxing coach
i‚Äôn on a diet for my disease AND to lose weight therefore it cancels out boys, i‚Äôm scot free

As if they're going to go through that much effort... they wont even walk up the stairs to get to the box
My stylist is a fit, handsome guy with big, sexy hands. Can't say I don't like it when he tousles my hair.
Yea the conversation went as expected and now I'm looking for a new job. Thanks to all for the help
Feel you pain. Stay strong
I tend to agree with you. They all have innocent blood on their hands.
I disagree. Every starting receiver [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] will have over 1k yards on the season while [NAME] cracks 2k. 
They were on action news yesterday, they‚Äôre friends now
Its the easiest subject in the whole school, they teach us stuff we should‚Äôve learned when we were 11, it‚Äôs so bad...
Sometimes that would work. Sometimes it wouldn't. Regardless, the OP asked what he could do, not who was at fault.
aaand it's time for the refs to take over the game again
*Dread it, run from it* *[NAME] still arrives*
Yeah. She kills herself, but by accident. 
Yep! The artist also has one where he's plowing a blue Incineroar and it's one of the best things I've seen.
Maybe delve into existentialism, read books from existentialist authors? Not that I'm a big fan of it, but maybe that could help you out.
The only one I'd recomend is [NAME] to be honest
The second kid won. No question.
Maybe, I'm just saying that there are players with more talent out the gate than him.
Uhhhh... didn‚Äôt y‚Äôall just eat the light lunch that you said you wanted on your preference sheets? Shut up.
Beautiful. Up there with that retro '14 Timbers kit for my favorite non-Atlanta MLS kits.
I literally cried out IS THAT MATT BERRY?!?!?!?!?!
My bitch dun left me All alone She took mah squeeky ball And mah rasty bone
Little did you know 95% of these kids just don‚Äôt want to go to school
Oh, he isn't dead, [NAME] 
Thanks for choosing to immunize. That said, I wish DSHS had taken away your children while you were putting them and others at risk.
Or 16th if you're on console.
You‚Äôre right. With IDs coming temple desk workers will look an awful lot like TSA workers.
And it is always because of a dropped combo that should have killed
For her? Nah
No problemo bro an another thing idk if this will affect you but you can't get your gun license if you get ur card
I had this :
I'm glad you found your way. And even missing one day of effexor gets me sick so I feel for you
[NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro
She's going to OD without a clue the first time she's introduced to Avocado & toast...
Glad it's not just me!

I half expected her to turn her head to face me as her jaw unhinged and her eyes went black..
Had no clue what they were but first thing I realized is how bad the logo is
You're in the wrong subs
I'm not white.
I really miss AG
We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.
Are you sincerely saying that [NAME] are bad because they were in the minority?
We didn't win in Alvalade even when they got 7th place. We just have some sort of block there
I hope you can get some relief soon, I can‚Äôt imagine how awful that must feel 
Rusty you the bomb! I'm okish now but just knowing you are out there makes me smile! Cheers! xoxo
In this case his hands were up, so the solution is them keeping their hands up, and not beating innocent people. 
The entire culture of NE is win at all costs. Not sure where you live but if that kid shovels snow..tell mom to him bring home .
And I've no monkeys left.... Sorry man
[NAME] was nowhere near them, he was by the Falcon. 
My favourite is when [NAME] was getting ready to be taken out of her house, but she had to have a bowl of Froot Loops first.
Bro I love how she deletes it so all ur hard work is gon
So proud our sub is leaking into facebook
Since [NAME] are technically [NAME].
I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.
[NAME] I've smoked for 20 years. Really is time to quit.
I thought it was something about the dog not smelling your drugs, but now i'm just sad that you didn't get to pet it :(
You need to talk to her openly about this... without shaming her. She‚Äôs being open and honest with you. Your turn.
It could be, but I hope it's abandoned. I haven't been too impressed with the flash forwards. 
What a dumbass question to start with...
Minarchists cant be socialists. This doesn't apply to you brosky.
So in that case I'd be able to look at what I'm about to lose until I come back the next round üòÖ
Big big hold from the [NAME]
Slovenia is awake and ready for some Mavs magic!
And this is why men are so against #believewoman
It doesn't *meet* any moral or ethical standpoint.
Wich stinks for you
I‚Äôll check out and see if is!! Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Yeah but how is that even possible if 99% of girls who are out are with friends? That‚Äôs pretty intimidating
This is my favorite reddit conversation I‚Äôve seen in a while
It was 90 degrees
A is just horrifying. If she were to die I‚Äôd want her to go painlessly
I didn't know that they had that on there lol. Are those the kind of shows that you're into?
Thanks I had heard this advice, Almost botched it in November.
That's just, like, your opinion, man
What‚Äôs funny is these objectively corrupt sacks of shit were bitching about made up Liberal ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù.
God [NAME] can't come back fast enough. I don't know if the fans in the rest of the league realize how big his loss is
Except when you get put against the same 6 stack 5 times in a row and they smash you every time... was not a good time
Not for me. The ankle area is the least painful, compared to the rest of your body 
I want to give you reddit gold but I‚Äôm poor and bad at money spending so have my love instead
I love my Arabian but I have found the golden turkmen to be my more go to horse.
I'm 31 and didn't even have my first cell phone, period, until I was 20. This is just more anthropological fake news.
From what you're saying, we can estimate the age of every person we see by their height.
I mean, this just looks more like a case of a guy being overrated coming out of high school.
i hate u...
Ferrets are such good ESA's though! Good for you at least, I love ferrets with all of my heart.
Also packed with preservatives and extra chemicals! Homemade Bread: 4 ingredients, Store Bread: ~22 ingredients...
In such a situation, I would save the mother. Always.
Ya uh that's gen Z sorry
"Thanks. Appreciate that perspective. I'm just saying it as a counter to the ""rope is the only cope"" mentality on the incel subreddit."
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
Should I watch this? Will it aggravate me?
Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn‚Äôt washed the blood out yet.
War is quite different than state sponsored democide.
I have to but I‚Äôm about to start looking for like career type jobs and if I can‚Äôt drive I‚Äôm stuck.
Same. I unfollowed the cast and the fan pages. I can‚Äôt anymore lol
You‚Äôre supposed to go around them
I used to like [NAME] so much him and [NAME] were one of my fave couples but I‚Äôm over him and his BS lol
That‚Äôs part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
I agree, this subs being a little overly toxic about it
[NAME] bless [NAME]
Why does he have the vault boy face lol
This commercial really just reminded me what scumbags Verizon are
Congratulations, you can into geolibertarianism
Ok ill get right on that. I have all day to hunt. Thanks for the quick reply.
The concept, design and artwork are gorgeous. I would love to buy this skin if it was available in game. 
This is the greatest Bama game I've ever watched
Posting someone elses camp on reddit? Really? haha.
Yeah but shortly after got disinterested so i broke it to her lol
Tight competition down there. Tanking for the bottom worse is tougher than getting home court advantage.
wasn‚Äôt it just reported that the [NAME] report will be ‚Äúanticlimactic?‚Äù Don‚Äôt like [NAME], I‚Äôm just keeping it real.
My problem is I like to get high

Like I said, I‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs working out for him but for most of the world being gainfully employed societal norms absolutely matter.
tailing... BOL!
Sounds good to me.
Spriefs ( spandex/athletic boxer briefs). Feels like nothing, keeps your junk in place, breathable and is super cool looking.
Exactly why I‚Äôm saying we won‚Äôt land KD ... but Knicks fans do know a lot about dreaming.
"he tried to motivate the team in the locker room but i think it was [NAME] who was like ""just sit down festus"""
Before he was riding a Bronco he was riding your mom.
/Steps into freezing night. [NAME], forgot my car keys.
A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
Wow she sounds like fun
Damn, and he was wearing a helmet too.
These are the same thing
[NAME] forced [NAME] to give it up, leading to a steal, and then gets a steal himself on the next play. Love his tenacity.
It's wonderful and gives me happy happy feels
I love Fate too. I hope you have a great life and that everything goes the way you want it to.
Poor [NAME]. Give him some Enfamil. He will feel better soon.
Same. Even while not on my period I have lower back pain
Thanks, I felt underappreciated until now!
It might be a person that isn't good at English dude :/
[NAME] here...that guac looks horrible
Thanks. I appreciate that. At least I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
Oof, that's rough. :( Sorry that happened to you, mate. 
"Checked my EBT balance yesterday. ""You will not be receiving benefits for February."". I wonder when the riots are going to start."

Dude looks like a lady
Theyre paid with taxes..... Do you think you're arguing against an anarchist? lol
:) that‚Äôs a start. One thing down.
Your point? That doesn't mean it had 2 of EVERY FREAKING LAND MAMMAL on it!
One time a lady got mad at me because her White Zinfandel was.......pink
Yep. Still don't know what you're talking about. Come back when you actually read the pdf and become informed.
[NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] could see that they were tipped off. 
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty cringe tbh, I think he‚Äôs a good guy just a little insecure 
Franchise QB's are leaders who set the tone for the entire lockerroom. [NAME] is a terrible leader.
I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].
Is there really anything more to know about?
I feel like I have to call bs on this one. I hope lol
Isn't he still in contention for the Miami HC job? And if not, Dallas would block it.
Omg saucepan what a daring and unconventional look!!!11
It wouldn't have been hard to get more votes than [NAME] because [NAME] was so hated.
Science is measuring what we see. I also notice that you didn't respond to anything else I said, which tells me that you've got nothing.
Wow, now that you say that . Although, we do have [NAME], South Park, Family Guy and American Dad now. Mmmmm, [NAME] 
I'm doubting the teeth cleaning.
You were at a casino. Sounds like you won.
You consider 15-17 year olds people too!?! Thanks, i suppose!
My Dachshund loves trying to lick my son's mouth when he's laughing. Every single time.
Go for it! It may be a great thing.
No, every movie shouldn't be like that. But a good protagonist is a good protagonist!

Love your /u/ so much.
and [NAME] got blessed with a LocationBot cat fact?! There is no justice in the world...
I would love to hear [NAME] and [NAME] in Podcast
This guy has some serious emotional issues...best to ignore him and not engage
Right now! What should I do!?
I miss seeing us capitalize on our rivals‚Äô slip ups
I just never felt like a boy. I hate my body and I just feel like I can't express myself for who I am.
You say weaboo, we say virgin
Meanwhile in western society grown-ass adults will leave their McDonald's trash scattered all over the place just feet away from the bin.
MY DADDY SAID THE CIVIL WAR WUZ ABAOT STATE RIGHTS AND HE'S THA BEST BROTHUR I EVER HAD
Oh [NAME] that was horrible
The movie powder is based on this guy

holy shit that person is a fucking asshole, talk about a huge red flag for your stepbrother.
Venezuela has uniquely terrible oil.
You are profoundly ignorant on this country. There is literally not one serious person who would contest the correlation between diversity and support for liberals.
No. I've been bashing it for its very noticable issues that have plagued it for 3 years that the cw wont fix.
Agreed, even better
It seems like someone felt personally attacked, lol.
This is not a ‚Äúdank‚Äù meme you normie

Honestly [NAME] is just enjoying his 350k and sits at home to play Fortnite ar this point. He‚Äôs done for

Like always i will wait and see thanks for the post tho [NAME]
It's a Mercedes. Take it in for an oil change, and it's an enormous bill.
We gotta keep our hopes up sometime.
It says so in the bottom right corner :)
What is a punishment if not an undesirable consequence imposed by others?
Drinking and cussing = toxic masculinity Everyone on that submarine should be re-gendered as punishment!!!!!

Ah from what I understood you could barely read the biggest line on the chart. I thought this was a general statement.
Do you.....have a certificate showing you're not a donkey-brained man?
Yep. 30ish middle class white fairly fit. Just started CrossFit!
Those bastards lied to me
Well attention whores are women(mostly) that always seek validation from other people, something that can really become very obnoxious and annoying.
Comment for later
I hope this guy got found and fired. That's way too dangerous. He could have easily killed someone.
I mean maybe to the casual conservative, but people who believe Hollywood is a [NAME] propaganda machine usually already have the swastika flag and all I would think.
genji dmg buffs are eh but everything else except a nerf to zen are crazy
It really is a brilliant piece of nostalgia and terrible film making. I love everything about it.

Honestly capital G god is probaby the only diety I would struggle allowing at my table, no matter which [NAME] religion it was picked from.
Bit like Dundee United trying to not concede 5 against Ayr United.
Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background.
You‚Äôre the meme this sub jokes about.
Sorry, I‚Äôm just so hungry right now 
Damage values would be fantastic. I also really appreciate having detailed kit information. We no longer use attachments so listing specializations would be nice.
I use the app, it's not embedded they just don't bother changing it.
What will the UN bring anyway? Turkey will be victorious. I love my country.
Yeah strong man makes me nervous, imagine if he dropped it on his foot? üò¨
Ah the city of brotherly love <3
Whoops yeah my bad And no just from the pictures ive seen there were just u opened sauce packets arranged on platters
I always wondered how testicles sound when popping.... hoping that it would never happen to me.
Ehh, still pretty ambitious lobs for [NAME] though. I'd get it if it was [NAME]. 
Thank you so much. ‚ù§ I'm going to be okay.
Baby what is you doing.
[NAME], I forgot about that. Eight seconds was more than long enough to murder everybody in sight.
This is your moment!
If we can‚Äôt even score on the power play pulling the goalie made no sense
If you don't believe the government has the power to restrict things, you're not a liberal, you're an anarchist or a libertarian.
The moment [NAME] got activated off IR, [NAME] got placed on IR.
She has an amazing voice
That‚Äôs such a beautiful moment to find each other there and support each other even if you know you can‚Äôt have each other.
just apologize. what other advice could you possibly require? you fucked up, now deal with it.
The very best they could do was the uranium one unscandal, which even [NAME] had too much dignity to touch. 
I'm most amazed by implicit suggestion that you still aren't showing any signs. i mean coming out should be sign enough right?
Don't get excited yet...
Happy New Year everyone! It‚Äôs 11:42 in CA 2019‚Äôs almost here
Hahaha and those pathetic elderly taking computer classes. What worthless trash people XD
You've got thoughts coming your way my dude
Yes! Though I also do sofrus. Learning to write mezuzos and another megillah at the moment.
Lmao doesn‚Äôt even try to refute.
[NAME] can‚Äôt space and [NAME] is getting worse defensively
When [NAME] scores not one, but TWO goals it means you're doing something wrong
Unfortunately, successful and rich people blame foreigners too :(
I don't know why anyone would willingly live in an HOA.
This makes me smile!
Oh yeah, thanks, sorry for the confusion, good thing someone called their bullshit :)
This show has completely gone downhill, can‚Äôt believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh
From heroic cancer survivor to bad Italian boy. What a world we love in
Ah, that's why they say don't run in the corridor
You can see his tooth bouncing off the pavement on the right after he falls. Brings a tear of joy to my eye üòÖ
I want to keep [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] (also [NAME], but he doesn't want to stay). Everyone else can go. 
I had to write in the Swangas. Seems far better than the choices given.
It's still not something I'd jump to and I'm currently in a closed relationship really.
I am trying so hard right now! LOL!
The complete series is on Hulu just finished watching it. Definitely recommend
Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
"As [NAME] once said, ""what do you mean?"""
Never said that. Not once. Punishment isn‚Äôt slavery. Unless you‚Äôd rather just kill lawbreakers
"In the voice of [NAME] from The Office ""Incorrect. You didn't *Pin* anyone"""
My favorite [NAME] post-match celebration hands down.
He is holding you hostage. Sad state of affairs.
At what time does this happen? I'm not going to watch a 5 minute showering video. OP clip this shit earlier
The toes stretched out as he hangs from the swinging door is too much cuteness for me
Dude. Do you have any idea what that would cost??
Oh I don‚Äôt think so
Yepp. I've struggled to hold a job so I'd be in trouble without it.
That's a good idea! Unfortunately don't have a vehicle big enough, so I'll have to hire someone with a truck.
This is what I'm thinking of doing. I just thought tafe was the go to.
I work closely with GoA (but not for them) and I agree. They made a lot of great policy and program decisions.
There is a guy that looks like [NAME] in my local Walmart
Hmm... I don't think EPCOR is the reason the oilers suck
Yeah I was super surprised by how good Trench was, probably my top album from last year
...oh goddamn it, that's in my sales territory.
Despite how selfish that seems, I respect the honesty. 
Ah the remnants.
What everyone thinks until they see what houses out here cost. :(
I feel bad for house slaves, even if it's in their understandable self-interest. 
"Can I comment on the lost opportunity/remarkable restraint by [NAME] to not have a ""MLK I Have a Dream Mattress Sale"""
Yeah, I understand. Sorry about that, have a nice week!
She needs new non-enabling friends.
Unfortunately not. üòè
Remember, they gave ANF Above The Law an 8.
Lilo and Stitch is one of my favorites. I really want to go buy a stuffed Stitch to hug now.
Aww, what was your favorite thing you did with him while you were there?
Love hearing [NAME] talk about money not gonna lie.
This is damn sick. Has almost a vapor wave feel lol.
The simple ones feel elegant.
He's not alt-right. He's just the normal clutch pearling conservative. He's like an annoying villain from an 80s movie.
Hedonism at it's finest
You shouldn't be here. You're not an anarchist. GTFO
They lived a good life! I honor them by using all their parts
I'd still try to pet it
What happened when [NAME] shutdown the government?
I cannot help but get a sense of schadenfreude when a seemingly shitty person ruins their own career right before my eyes. ‚òïÔ∏è
He‚Äôs been shit. Makes the wrong decision in the final third every time this game.
"Was the song ""New Light""? I'd love to see the vid you're talking about if you come across it"
Did he say skinny wieners?
Well said, hope more and more people continue realize this and discover/take-back their power!
There's a difference between rights and law. Stop conflating the two.
As an autism mum, I can‚Äôt thank you enough. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm replying just bask in the glow with someone else! Yay!!
I am sure all the [NAME] had these ready to go since the [NAME] didn't do their job in oversight, let the subpoenas begin!
they could be extinct. plenty of creatures no longer exist anymore.
Props to your dad, you dodged a big bullet there
I think all coffee is keto already....
Just a pretty parrot. He pops over to say g'day to a mate of mine most sunny arvo's.
So nothing? His office is going to do nothing? Or will the location of the office be a fictional place?
thank you for your kind words.
‚ÄúTo fight there civil rights battles for them.‚Äù Okay, with that in mind, do you agree with the message of the Gillette ad?
I've gone through phases like that, usually related to depression or something else going on in my life. See if it passes in a couple weeks.
Thanks dude. Shit happens!
That is a valid question, I hope it can change, but admittedly that hope is pretty small.
She manages to interview the most horrible people, as long as they're willing. Can't have an interview with someone who'll only attack your questions. 
Sew up that cockholster son, no one gives a fuck.
Well he abused his previous girlfriend, he ran a porn site that's what I know
70 year old me doesn't give a fuck just piss or get off the pot!
You should eat real cake today too!
If you plan on doing more then do leo next. Hitting /r/Tekken with the gender mixup.
Most of the cast of Riverdale save for [NAME], but for some reason my girlfriend and I can't stop watching this trainwreck of a show.
I had the biggest smile!
Negative canthal tilt. Poor lil' guy.
Everyone can see what [NAME] can do when protected. That week 2 Green Bay game was what everyone was expecting when the team signed [NAME].
Maybe he *did* leave the building. If you can't find him, he could've left without you knowing. Is that better or worse?
I was just quoting the president (through his press secretary) to be honest.
">Turkish [NAME] You are right except ""[NAME]"" part. I could not found the attack but there was a [NAME] [NAME] who was involved.."
omg this is a bit too relatable
I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say that‚Äôs a terrible idea.
Ok good. Thanks for letting me know. I‚Äôm not very experienced with Reddit‚Äôs messaging/chat so I wasn‚Äôt sure.
Yeah, sorry for that one. Some opportunities are too good to pass up.
Also interesting to note that [NAME] left Lille for Monaco, been an interesting player when I've watched Lille this season
If at first you don‚Äôt succeed...welp, nevermind.
‚ÄúGuys watch out, the scary looking kid is coming down the hall‚Äù
[NAME] doesn't even look that big here. But he's still handsome.
You probably didn't know the right people
If you were under the old pay model you would disagree with that
Just like a marvel movie then!
Hahah, it's all good now since I've got a mouse now
The horizon is very beautiful in this game. You should look at it often.
I lost a six pack this way once. For a good year every traffic stop became a field sobriety test.
What does ‚Äòopen border‚Äô mean to you? Honest question because I may be confused by what it means
No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.
Wow! That's too real, it touched me! Nice work :D
People have made money off it. Belle Delphine was hit with a $60,000 fine recently
stuff is incredible on fried chicken
I understand it but still can't ask questions. I am too afraid
An online poll that the Berners didn't manage to swarm? Color me shocked.
He's not debating he's asking the questions to the debaters and said he wants to purposely ruin in of their arguments
it's not up to the drivers, its up to the owner. Owner doesn't have to drive in the ice.
Still the greatest timeline tho
Been there, done that. Not the best idea unfortunately. Especially if it doesn't work. Gets awkward 
Not as bad as the face [NAME] making
It's over! Move on and find a better partner.
"color me embarrassed"" I wonder what colour he'd be if she showed that text exchange to his missus. "
What does NGL stand for? Not gonna lie?
Glad you're rid of me? Pretty obviously breaking the sub rules there.
Did not expect pint sized [NAME]. That was cute!
"It makes for awkward conversation when I ask ""What's your favorite song?"" And I get ""I just liked the shirt"" in response"
Juicing at 19 seems so extreme to me
Athletes in the making. Can't wait to see them playing professionally.
This post is inappropriate for this subreddit.
I really want to know what restaurant this is. I'm picturing Fino for some reason.
I'd rather be tasteless than artosis
Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
You're going to be pissed.
It's all out of love... We promise.
Generally, but Chicago has easily gotten 12 inches of lake effect snow in the past.
"Great. Now some girl in Utah will appropriate it for her prom this year because she ""appreciates"" the culture."
When have you seen him speak in his real voice?
Now you can.
Love him.
Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.
Makes way less mistakes than [NAME]
r/btc is the only place in the world who thinks like that while the rest of the world thinks Bcash is a shitcoin nobody uses.
First of all, that's not true in any sense of the terms. Second of all, I'm not a national socialist lmao
i remember that feeling.
Shocked basement leaking got you freakin lady
I always thought of the sound of lakes freezing on cold nights. It's pretty surreal in itself.
Call the IWW.
Fucking coward.
I didn't know psychiatrist would do therapy. Their time tends to be really limited compared to a therapist.
That's kind of sad to be honest.
I fall under left wing, so yup, I'm a soy boy.
Can this be posted on r/BreadTube if the person doesn't pour some kind of fluid on themselves?
Thank you for this
When she asks how he lost his arm she is looking up to him
[NAME], if you're doing an Undertale deal, not having a red heart on your ass is inexcusable.
Not ruined. They'll be bonded back in place if they were permanent crowns. Source: I have 14 crowns. Don't recommend.
Mr. [NAME]! Nooooo!
Had a buddy fly from BC to Ontario yesterday with an illegal ounce in a ziploc. No problems.
Yeah - we never had a fight. I'm glad we managed to end it in good terms. Thanks a lot for the sentiment, mate. Cheers!
That's awesome. Hahaha
league better do right by us and gift us zion. They did this for Nola and Cleveland too....i need to believe in something....pleasE!
W-what a great audience
Thanks, I actually just reached out to my counselor and said I'd like to switch to just myself.
Cant wait to hear a hot take from the second dumbest people who ever loved ([NAME] ots the first if you are asking)
Soooo difficult to do.
Im not going to swear
Oh man that hurt to watch
I‚Äôm only denying what‚Äôs not true, and [NAME] being my name isn‚Äôt true. 
Welcome to religion 101
Damn straight! My folks only knew when I told them about it!
I‚Äôm laughing so I don‚Äôt cry
Ahaha it's his mother's fault!
my favourite depictions of [NAME] and the gang are the ones where [NAME] is stoic and sassy and [NAME] and [NAME] are super emotional goofballs
I just want instant run off voting, which wasn't one of the three options.
Quit being a crybaby. If this how you handle any criticism then it's no wonder you're alone and will be for quite some time
This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad.
That's an yup!
"I feel sorry for people that think Reddit (or even some random sub-reddit) is ""an international stage""."
Banned or moved to different platforms mostly. Never were that many and those that did post here had trouble following the rules and were downvoted heavily.
RAIN was amazing Strange seeing [NAME] and [NAME] looking so much younger
The only reason people are there is because they dont know [NAME] is fired lmao.
B, I dont frink coffee anyways 
I do not think it is 'wrong', I just see that the Pluses outweigh the Minuses. 
It's spelled HIPAA, not HIPPA. It also doesn't do what you think, and at best it's the ADA that discourages employers from asking.
Although strange sounding at first, the objective names from BF1 really grew on me. 
Could be worse. At least he's not the guy who wrote the Witcher books LOL.
Sauerkraut is amazing, but only as a side to a main.
I kind of hate it when I agree with you, but definitely do this time. 
This made me laugh so hard I farted and woke my dog up. Only thing missing is the confetti.
Damn that coyote was a fucking noob.
It does lol If you delete it off your phone it wouldn‚Äôt trace your estimated location unless it‚Äôs active on it
I love her
THANK [NAME]
I'm sending you all the hugs ;-;
WHEN IS SOON YEEZUS KRIST
I know! BTW I love your choice of critter. Penguins are fabulous.
Does anyone notice how his voice always changes when he‚Äôs trying to be cute and charming.
Yeah she really didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs prob for the best even though it‚Äôs tough right now. Thank you
‚Äú[NAME] make y'famous tonight, buddy!‚Äù ü§£ Anyway, no manger for him!
Missed opportunity to put [NAME]
She deserves to know.
Have fun getting robbed
"Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
USE GLOVES YOU MANIAC
[NAME], learn some fucking grammar and punctuation. Maybe use some paragraphs. Just an idea.
Fun fact, His pants are on backwards in this pic
Yeah, It's just difficult to resist the lure of the dark side.
That‚Äôs wonderful
Damn i am sad that got deleted
It's a last resort when I forget my iPod, I swear
Nah man I prefer endless cause of the part where he goes WOMWOMWOMWOMWOMWOM WOOOOOO REEEEEEEEE like that's lyrical genius right there
why would you have kids? why would you chose not to be with that girl with big boobs? you dumped her?!
Or the Lady Killers, except it's a bank and not a Casino. Set in the south too.
Lake inle is a beautiful place
Honestly? I dont know. My parents told me that itd be seen as suspicious
Never mind the delays. Fish, unlike Wine or cheese doesn't improve with age.
Oh, so I can go straight to hell when I die? No thanks.
Find a new doctor. If he isn't willing to treat people because of political affiliation then he's a horrible doctor and an even worse person.
If he worked out he would look good I think. But not in a way I would be attracted to him lol, just in general.
Welcome to Pittsburgh
For what it's worth, I hope you have a great year anyway.
thats really kind, thanks stranger
My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!
Nah I‚Äôm good. I like my parents and their food.
"""you can't arrest me!! I'm attractive!"""
Oh you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Thank you my friend
Everyone get your tea kettles ready to boil some water so that you can throw it into the cold air!
you never go full loco
(While I love this moment, she wasn‚Äôt a judge, she was an inspirational guest.)
Probably, but I'm also fairly certain it's easier for a [NAME] to get in than an [NAME] or a [NAME].
Weird but effective
You're so right. It's unbelievable how well generalizations work for this game.
There's limitations. Also, someone may have been assigned the number before a player joined the team.
At least he didn't knock himself out on the ground....
He's just logged off and I can't wait for you to see the final number.
Me too, me too.
I love this passive aggressiveness!!
A credit score is not important: Convince me otherwise.
[NAME] left that on purpose. Would bnever have scored
Lol. Not everything is about your pet issue but I do appreciate your attempts to frame it that way. Keep up the good fight!
(System auto-corrects Tyranus) - You interfered with our affairs for the last time.
Besides a petty theft conviction out of Florida in 2003, there's nothing. No other convictions.
oh yes! i did not know pizza could possibly ever be disgusting until i moved to florida.
ah, ok! i'm afraid i do, i just didn't realise that's what it meant (so old i am going stupid....)
Eh, it's very easy for him to show up and offer guidance to the NJO (or whatever happens) IMO
[NAME] is doing that since season 1. Even [NAME] commented in S1 that everytime sometimes is up, [NAME] inserts herself into argument. It's her MO.
Well that sucks. But still if you refuses the test you'd probably have been charged, which is worse.
Same. However, do we have tea or is this just speculation?
>YOUR STATEMENT I'm not that person.
[NAME] stop thinking too much and just do stuff like that
So glad she died
You just defended him with a bunch of doublespeak bullshit so I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree. You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.
ooh boy that guy went off the deep end and drowned
are you printing labels through ebay/paypal/other online service? You get a discount there. If you're paying retail, stop it. 
This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
Disney World/Land or NYE at Time's Square have always made me nervous.
Honestly just tired of this shit, people who'd rather see us tank than push for playoffs. Literally want us to be the fucking Suns.
Worst advice ever. This would piss me off.
Damn this kid and her fancy clothes makes me feel like a bad parent.
No... that's literally our first rule.
[NAME] is still trying to wrap his head around how the Browns got [NAME].
Just added that information. Thanks
My fav character
For drunks is a paradise!!
I remember 2008-2010. Phones couldn't do that yet. Phones had 640x480 screens back then, and believe me, we were amazed by that.
Totally here for [NAME] and [NAME] boxing [NAME] in before he even announces
Emotional support [NAME]?
There is this story of a woman who got pregnant from anal due to some rare condition:
You can thank [NAME] for that. He wouldn't commit to taking [NAME]. He wanted to play for [NAME]. He shunned uncertainty, not the Jets.
Tool fan from the U.S. here. Something seems off about this question. Cheers, mate!
If you think all manufactured foods haven't got those contaminants then you're sadly mistaken.
TIL the Recession, Great Depression, Colonialism, War on Drugs etc. were created by socialists. 
I'm right there with you on the acting. Never thought I would be able to pull it off.
And the woman dropped her underwear and begged him to fuck her. But in all his MGTOWness he refused.
I'm so gay I can't even drive straight - a bumper sticker older than most redditors
We never knew what friends we had, until we came to Lehningrad
Before you get too excited remember the human Officer is there to help his doggy partner.
Too late. You badmouthed London. You're on the list now.
US is asking to be allowed to do quarterly reviews by a team of US people. CCP has replied that this is unreasonable and humiliating.
What a great response!!
Hugs. We put our sweet lady kitty to sleep one year ago tomorrow.
Not taking any shit, not being afraid to stick up for themselves or say what they‚Äôre thinking. Stomping on eggshells.
This man has a great attitude!
I couldn‚Äôt believe that. I‚Äôve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN‚Äô?
You could feel all his life flowing into your body
My aim in battlefornt 2 is pretty good = navy seal, elite unit
Literally what happened.
"""Fascist criticizes another fascist."" Not much to see here."
This idiot can't be bothered to comprehend anything that reads longer than a bumper sticker.
Yeah, I was thinking my boy was into them before that. But I doubt Panic! At the Disco would have peaked his interest.
Thanks for sharing! I loved [NAME] interview too haha. Looking forward to his on-court reunion with [NAME].
Thank you so much I am so proud of myself!
My husband died outside the church Damn Vampires
I am eternally grateful that youtube did not exist while I was doing all my weird shit growing grow.
I‚Äôm just in awe because this will actually get so many people up in arms.
I see what you saw there.
> I can't see a teenage girl naming her only son the same name that her baby daddy's actual wife's trueborn son is. /r/brandnewsentence
From what I remember, a lot of the leafs fans had [NAME] from 8.5-9.25. I can‚Äôt recall someone saying 10+
I wish [NAME] made the levels up to 100.
Haha! Do it.
He really has us in that first half.
Considering you could do it and be out over a highschool summer vacation, why not?
And then they got shot down
I wish I could just do a poll of the whole stl area to see everyones opinion on it.
Lmgs and shotguns
Wow. Racists are really coming out of the woodwork to excuse and defend racism. How sad.
OMG this is gaming history in the making. Lol I can't w8!
What is old Canada?
I wanna give [NAME] a mosquito bite
[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point
Thank you very much, I'm glad you found it easy to follow!
What the fuck is The Baffler? I can't even go there at work.
I'm so sorry. That's awful.
If this was some weird publicity stunt to announce the [NAME] is coming back I will die. In reality, it makes me think he's coming back
Cant wait to see it buddy!
You‚Äôre as cool as a hand-job on a honeymoon. Go draw some anime and cry yourself to sleep.
[NAME]? As in thay Saint Jimmy's shit that seems to be showing up in every convenience store these days?
Bohemian Rhapsody is a horrible song. Really horrible. Queen had a lot of great songs, but that one wasn't one of them.
"""I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, [NAME]?"""
I'd be so pissed if that was my lunch
I‚Äôm scared.
but that's what covers are for. They show the title and sometimes a relevant image so you quickly know the contents.
Ok, if that's what you think. I'm just a bystander at this point and laughing at how angry people are getting.
Where the mask inside, too? Are air purifers not good enough for inside? Sorry for the dumb question... Just moved here this week.
Not everybody can grow their own or even wants to.
Those women are the worst.
not in the slightest. im actually dumbfounded.
Don't stay too long or you might go Nakamoto : P
The dad was in stitches..
In this day and age I‚Äôm actually surprised at how many hotels haven‚Äôt sorted plugs by the beds yet
I disagree with all of what you just said but I am in the same booooaaaaat.
I came here to say basically the same thing. Too much talent and positional flexibility to have a standard lineup.
I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm here! Thank you all!
It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
I'm honestly surprised. We should have fallen much farther
Can you apply to some kind of help within your university? Sorry this is happening to you.
Hot damn... we're going to Sea World!
Yup. How sad is it to admit I'm jealous of the ravens run game and defense üò£

The good news for him, is that he can join one of these many wars.
Based on a quick google search, there are 65 species of possum, 1 of which is native to North America.
Sounds like you may be demisexual? I know I am. Just wouldn't be able to be casually intimate with someone personally
I think that in return they should sign [NAME] to a long term, cap friendly deal and send him back to us
good luck, little 3 year old
much like nhs staff dwp employees have little say over the quality of service they are expected to deliver under the circumstances.
Doing [NAME] work.
Which makes no sense. [NAME] associate cheap prices with shit products (reason why Walmart was pushed out) but free shit is always just looked at as free shit.
Hahah Yea imagine what the GM guys will do when the DD app crashes for hours
That's memorial park. Mountain bike trails and the rugby pitch.
And he even dared to reference fairly odd parents in there, wtf lol
Non horny girls do.
No way we would turn down [NAME] for [NAME]. BS
It‚Äôs really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
Or just get the fuck out and never look back.
Though I encourage! For an opportunity to play a game of such grand anticipation as this, is a sweet fortune.
Well it wasn‚Äôt opinion they didn‚Äôt like it was fact right?
Again. Spygate was legal.
Seems like you took a hard side in the previous 3 comments. Hypocrite much?
Thanks! I‚Äôll take that into account in the future!
Same, actually. Funny, just saw him in a local video doing the same bit.
What?! I am level 20 and I already had 4. I did 5 hide outs in total not counting the tutorial hide out.
This, in top of my already terrible mental health, is the reason why I'm severely underweight and need help.
Thanks! I appreciate the kind words :)
ok
Welcome. Brooklyn > Manhattan anyways
Get the hell out of here with that fiscal sensibility and care for other human beings!
Oh, their theme gives me anxiety.
Leave ASAP. That is all. Your life will be better for it
I *want* to like R&M but people are making it really difficult
I know I am very worried
Poor *wittle* snowflake feels harassed, hahaha. If you don't want people to prove you're a moron, maybe don't make it so obvious.
Um excuse me the static reflectives are the best v2s period.
Hes looking for a handout of 3 free meals a day, education and skill training and a roof over his head. Jail, it works.
Oh my [NAME] that's so satisfying
MDC!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey guys, thanks for tuning in to another video on
It doesn't have to be illegal to be wrong. And really, *sit down*? lol
I bet we'd all die. Thank [NAME] for colds and germs or we'd all be dead upon birth
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm terrified of.
[NAME]... Nice
Survival of the toughest.
You are very welcome. Happy growing. Keep in touch with your success.
My worry about [NAME] is that running former governors hasn‚Äôt worked out the greatest. Especially when his been out of office for 11 years.
[NAME] has weird ideas about everything.
[NAME] left too early.
You are retarded
I can't watch Isco rotting on the bench and LV playing instead.
It's like they have no self-awareness, and they just engage in ridiculous hyperbole and expect to be taken seriously.
You‚Äôre so perfect :)
What were they mumbling at the end before the commercial break? That was weird.
Paying for the drinks doesn‚Äôt equate to drinking the drinks.
Thank you for sharing this with us
I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.
Theesomes won't make someone monogamous more open to solo stuff.
I love how [NAME] touted the Hong Kong model as something beneficial. What a joke.
Lol just reading that url makes it obvious you linked to some partisan hackjob.
If you attach barbed wire it will require the person breaking in to have a pair of pliers to break it down.
That‚Äôs not the whole
Correct. The LTB judgements are enforced by going through small claims. Which makes for another hurdle for tenants trying to collect judgements.

I rarely go to Dallas, I'm actually closer to Fort Worth. There's really not been much of a need to travel that far. 
Thank you and likewise to you friend!
I did some social media snooping since I posted this. Turns out they‚Äôre both not retired at 25. Go figure.

There are a lot of QVC hoarders out there. I have an obscene amount of argan oil. I've mostly curbed my hoarding now.
I actually really like this, and unironically find it funny. Forgive me.
I fell like you're being willfully ignorant of reality.
i was there in october and i was shocked at the amount of people on the interstate just casually browsing facebook while driving.
My last name is 4 letters. It's a common English word. It still gets mispronounced and misspelled constantly.
can you give us a quick summary (no spoilers)?
The problem is that data shows graphics sell, gameplay doesn't. It really sucks though, I wish they gave us a toggle at least

Did the goat enjoy it?
That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it‚Äôs just rage. I can‚Äôt look anymore.
You should make your own listing to showcase exactly this. Should be easy if it's as rampant as you say it is.
 No way, man. We're gonna keep on rockin' forever. Forever. Forever. Forever...

You just know they're the same people who call PTSD sufferers cowards, or would make fun of someone having a panic attack.
Yeah, at least carry a ziploc bag of dead cockroaches with you for this purpose, like a self respecting meal scamming scumbag. 
Would u rather the food go into the bin or be eaten by birds?
It's amazing how utterly lacking in self-awareness this sub is, that it can upvote this without a hint of irony.
"""They mostly vote at night... mostly."""
It's a shame you didn't get to see the event live. At least your followers get to see nice vertical view of what was going on.
Neither are foreign coups set up with the countries chamber of commerce and the head of the army.

How often does this happen? To you and others? I'm curious.

No, I definitely understand that feel and empathize. That can be hard to deal with. How have you been as of late?
You. I like you
This happened at my local Odeon last night. The amount of confused faces was kinda funny to watch.

Mate it's been nice the last couple weeks. You're gonna die when a stormy period arrives.
Not dislexia, the recent news about kashoggi has for the most part conditioned us to expect horrifying g news where Saudi nationals in foreign countries are concerned

I bought it while it was on the winter sale. I have 34 hours already
Is it weird that I'm tearing up?
Every team in the league is gonna call New Orleans...cause it‚Äôs [NAME].
Yep. I found out that a member of the school board is upset about something that happened with their own child, and wanted access revoked for teachers. 
Fair, yes, [NAME] is against that, so a good transition on your part.
When it goes on your keyboard.
This honestly explains so much. Thanks for some insight into myself lol
Good news: this is shark tale not finding Nemo
[NAME]. I like those moments on Reddit when you understood the reference.
Nah halfway in the fight your shots were definitely not registering at all on him.. lol
Yeah no way random bubbling would get them the highest score. Even in a 50 question test the odd would be ridiculously low
[NAME]. Go on Chapo.
Thanks for saying this eloquently, I'm always a little put off by some of the man hating comments that pop up here occasionally.
Enjoy your karma
Please tell me that's not real... I haven't played the Assassin's Creed games... But do they really include such an obnoxious disclaimer?

Happy to play then? It might hurt...
Youre fantastic. Thanks! How cute
PATRIOTS BABY BRING IT ON!
Honestly I‚Äôm confused in 10 different ways here
[NAME] saved by the very compassion in society that he is trying to destroy.
Well, guess [NAME] wife is cheating on him.
Oh, fair enough. Praise be.
But we did get an awesome transit line from downtown to the airport, plus most of the Olympic facilities existed before the games.
I'm surprised that the police have not send her to a mental institution
Just wanted to say I love your username
It‚Äôs misleading. Better article:
Science was wrong in the olden times so we should force people to learn from our old book of the really olden times.
I've agreed with this since day one. Check out his match he he had with [NAME] back in NXT
Happy cake day bro... or ma'am. You have to see this to really take it in.
Fourth guy had nice hair though tbh
It should be people not petting being jerks
The IW writers didnt want him to get out of it and the plot felt extremely rushed.
Idk why you‚Äôre getting down voted I also pick it every time and almost always get it done on that initial skirmish
That whole thread makes me want to shake babies.
Pack it up, folks, this one wins the sub forever.
Could've done this last year and got [NAME]. I'm just praying we pick in the top 3
As bad as the session was, I really do love your drow bard she sounds super fun to play with
Oh yeah! He was great for us. 0.69 ERA in 24 G with 10.7 K/9. I forgot about him.
They are saying they are ethnically [NAME], which is true. Nationality and ethnicity are not synonymous.
I would cheer hard for a Cyborg win in that tourney.
This is awful.
You're welcome! And whoops, my bad. I did not know that, thank you. I edited it up above.
I‚Äôve learned to just laugh these off, and try not to dwell on them.

Lol well now you have even more in common! So happy to help and hope you can smile a bit before you zzzzzzz. :-)
I like how you have the word idiot in your name. You are sure living up to it
I do feel sorry for the squirrel, but I wouldn't say the dog is a jerk for acting on natural instinct.
At least you have some girl to talk with at work.
Thanks again!
HOW DARE ANYBODY CRITICIZE YOUR POST IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR POST HISTORY! RECOGNIZE HIS PRIVILEGE PEOPLE!!
I hope mcd's charged extra for the sauce.
I actually feel assaulted by this video.
Where else was he going to hang his sash up?
Fuck the fucking refs. Seriously. Fuck those fucking cunts. I'm so fucking mad. Fucking dickless fucking street walking fucking sluts.
Before the trade happened I knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] beauty had not reached me yet

I would go to bed early and I would have nothing to do the 3-4 nights a week I play tennis lol
That was a joke omg
I love that this Subreddit has so many good food suggestions! I'm kinda new to the area and still getting my bearings.
Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I‚Äôm sorry.

She wasn‚Äôt seeking asylum in Thailand though, she was just trying to pass through to Australia, where she already had a visa iirc. 
üòÇ I get excited when I see a profile OLD for a state employee.
Welcome to the freedom and democracy circus that is 'mercuh! üëç
This is a genuinely good point. It‚Äôs enough to take me from giving zero shits to giving a modest shit against them.
But if the dentist makes you wait more than 15 minutes, you are legally allowed to leave. ^I'm ^just ^kidding, ^you ^probably ^should ^stay.
Games like this are just demoralizing for our players.
I'd love to see a repo/recovery subreddit.
A royal with creme
Oh that leg. Like, she NEEDS to get that looked at!! ASAP!
Wish I could vote this up 1,000!
You can talk to me. It'll be good having someone nice around.
Or the one scrolling channel? When you‚Äôd accidentally look away and miss what you were waiting for and have to sit thru the whole thing again
Umm... I do it everyday since I was 13 and I‚Äôm fine... could be just me...
Story of my life
Appreciate the love! Maybe during the offseason, for sure! I'll pass it along
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Just relax, take a deep breath, let the blood flow. Everything's going to be fine.
I love democracy
I‚Äôm afraid I just blue myself
we roll tonight to the guitar bite. and for those about to rock, I salute you 
Like whoever you want to like but don‚Äôt treat people poorly based on superficial factors is ultimately the best advice
17 my boy. Best league minimum contract out there right now
You shifty leafs were too nice. Something had to be up.
Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.
What's this from?
I was thinking it‚Äôs sad that a team that hasn‚Äôt had a FRP for what seems like a decade has a better record than us.
Is he and his wife still together? I'm late on these things. üò≠
Yeah, too many blind assumptions. I'm just happy that we're getting four additional characters to pad the roster with.
I regale them with stories of times when the dfaq runs out of chocolate cake, reminding them that we too can sometimes have it rough. 
This is a huge stretch, but I would enjoy seeing some tweets from her hubby about it...
They are all secretly projecting their own cheating onto us. Emotionally stunted 5 year olds with zero impulse control will do that.
I‚Äôve lived in Florida. Hurricanes are *much* worse.
We didn't screw it up!
YEAAAAHH!!!!YEAAAAHHH!!!!...oh, here ya go, doom-di-doom...

Same business model as playboy ‚Äî people bought the magazine for the sexy ladies but the writing was excellent.
30% of the country are insane.
Thank you! Took this on my IPhone 7!
*nods* I know an unfortunate reality. I was presuming that he isn't in a situation like that based on what he said though.
[NAME] would love [NAME]. [NAME] would hate [NAME].
I honestly can't imagine [NAME] using any kind of profanity lol
That‚Äôs what really kills me - thinking about this from our daughter‚Äôs perspective. Thank you for this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
You still look cranky, goodnight.
U guys are like match made in heaven ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Shameless IG plug:

It‚Äôs 2019 dude chill out with the gender roles Edit: it‚Äôs 2019 I‚Äôm tired sorry

Thanks! Do you think I should talk to her or drop it for now?
Considering the whining he did in our modmail, he may not realize this.
For next time, there is a way bigger live chat over on r/BravoRealHousewives 
This is great, thank you
"I'm suprised they didn't use the classic: ""[NAME]?"" "
Glad you found it!
I teach in [RELIGION] school, too. Gotta love the *just and livable wages* the [RELIGION] Church talks about so much!
I discovered this channel last night! She has a video on Harry Potter and the end of history that‚Äôs really good.
If Wacky Races kept on going it would have 100% adult viewers

You've been banned from /r/chicagobulls
No no no, the ball was tipped. He‚Äôs a great kicker
This is the guy to talk to! Draftbuffs amazing and getting better constantly.
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been accosted many times by the cops, or as I call them ‚Äú[NAME] fash squad‚Äù !!!
So this offer is only open to isis? do you need to show some form of id to get the money.
I did. He wasn't. Y'all lost. Keep living in the past tho.
The crime here is using the shaker parmesan crap.
I never said prostitution doesn't exist. I said it is off the streets.
He‚Äôs gonna have a great season
Lawdaddy and dadturion the ultimate combo.
So cute and there would be nothing with talking to her about it after and both being on the same page
Well who knows Germany was way ahead of its time
No, cause the number of games and mins he's played to get those points is a joke.
Who would be deciding the quality standards? How would it work between genres or styles? Why would any of this even be enforced?
Right! I pictured my kids and my oldest would probably MAYBE try once to show the little one.
Alright. Go to your corner.
That's wonderful! As you're learning to accept and love yourself as you are, so will your followers! Don't give up and good luck!
Ahhhh the good old anecdote
Oh shit lol I forgot to put ‚Äúashamed.‚Äù
If you're on a budget, anywhere that's cheap. 
Love it!
I heard if your master gives you a piece of clothing you are set free. Has that happened for you yet?
A girl that ugly only liking me isn't a compliment its an insult and it shows [NAME] hates me
Didn‚Äôt know he had his initials on his thigh pads too
Whoa I'm impressed he returned the pillow to its original spot. Awesome parenting.
migration lol
Ooohhh shit, they did *not* just say men should be decent human beings, they've finally taken it too far! Gather the troops! /s
He has utterly squandered his time since leaving office. For those of us trying to champion his legacy it's a perpetual headache.
"LOL at one of [NAME] favorite activities being ""observing people""...including [NAME]! "
I can see why! I would totally be offended too!
good luck getting them to understand that
Bad news dude. You're almost 100 years past that.
I really wanted this to be a real sub.
you should definitely negotiate and ask. you have nothing to lose by asking. good luck!
You're not from America, are you? Bless your pure soul <3 
I can‚Äôt even hear what they are saying.
But it's still....the geographic location of Arizona haha.
Ya punk wanna know how the game ends while we‚Äôre at it?
Bagsy not in 1st!
FBI OPEN UP!
You are on bud!
I see that the facebook and twitter crowd is leaking into our sub. Awesome.
That only works for the ironclad
[NAME] rev up my tractor I got a cuzin to marry
That can be true...
Nah. Enjoy your free food
stupid science bitches
Plot twist: they don‚Äòt Want to Go To school
The Evergreen debacle shows how badly that goes in real life. Turns out the Diversity Coalition would actually hack [NAME] into pieces and parade her organs around.
I'm a male and I have trouble understanding these emotions, do not for one second think that they are normal emotions, male or otherwise.
Thank you for the support!
"*""Wow""*"
As someone who went through school before the internet existed, yes, weird creepy kids existed. Although it was more in your face. 
How do you know of this? Also dont spoil for me I'm looking forward to the new episodes.
Cool story bro!
I just finished rewatching the film and let me tell you. [NAME] is a legend.
Thanks for this gootecks but unfortunately this sub is a bunch of casuals that won't appreciate it, I'll see you in the SF sub
Thats odd but ill check it ü§î
"Maybe their inability to spell the word ""atheist"" is why they're a [NAME]."
Get in, I'll tune in now
Did you see it with [NAME]? I don‚Äôt see him have chemistry with anyone
So we‚Äôre reposting stolen jokes now... cool
League wants an LA team to finally work so bad
No. Maybe if he kills [NAME]. Still a long shot
I work at an R1 university, with most of my team composed of CS/CE undergrad students. Yes, I've known many...
[NAME] can play a round of golf in 18 shots. He's definitely a starter cause he can make [NAME] look like an amateur
Hush up. This is one of our greatest accomplishments. Teaching minorities the subtle art of self suppression though mutual degradation was no small task.
>friend Hahaha
Too bad they neve added a SC-00-BY unit to accompany him
I love your response. I wish I were this witty.
Very sorry for your loss.
Hire the best prostitute you can afford dude
**Iowa‚Äôs best player is out** I would simply avoid this game as we haven‚Äôt seen Iowa play without [NAME]
Why are our trolls so boring :(
Hmm I thought I was playing the game for fun and excitement and unlocking skins was just an added bonus
Don‚Äôt do it homie. Think of what it would be like for your kids.
I love the views from Red Road. Great photo.
That's the problem I'm pointing, the media use stupid clicbait names and people get dumber and dumber.
I mean this in the least creepy way possible, tell me how it works out NO DETAILS PLEASE GOD NO
Worse, he murdered King [NAME] in the most cowardly way possible. Both in the books and the show. 
I've started downvoting people for mentioning meat or animal products in their comments.
Ah, that sounds frustrating! Thanks for sharing. I think I might steer clear of the teeth thing. 
You can‚Äôt nag or argue people into a relationship with you.
From my experience is the difference that ketchup is smooth. And that tomato sauce contains spices and such.
I feel personally attacked.
Do you not give your snowmen brooms? I feel like that's a thing people do
No, stop! He'll stop cranking the job machine if you insult him again!
Just going to step in here to ask why you keep replying if you're unhappy with his comments?
getting sucked in to a maneuver thurster or the primary ship screws are hell of away to go
It's a perfect loop
They could have used the explanation of E-2 people vibrating at a different frequency. At least that‚Äôs previously established.
Good mythical morning. Hope you get better soon
I have endured worse.
Well then town is flummery for not guilty'ing the mafia lol
Oh go fuck yourself with your BS generalization.
Also looks pretty ‚ô≠
S A T I R E
Why? Mine is a mixed bag. Sometimes ready. Sometimes 5 but rarely ever more than 10.
this reminds me of the time when [NAME] bought Bofo lol
[NAME] is hot garbage.
It actually depends. Do you have PCOS? Because if you do, then that would explain the change as well. 
I love the thing. My jeans get all loose feeling after I wear them awhile. I feel skinnier when my jeans fresh.
Measuring my life in semesters filled with classes that are entirely worthless but I need a $60,000 piece of paper to get a job 
Bring back Ebbets Field!
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.
Can we get actual delivery dogs? I feel like that would be so much better... =D
Weird way to spell Voldo.
Thanks for clearing this up!
Honestly tho. You ever have someone order loaded fries like 2 minutes before you close your kitchen? I have. This is similar to what they got.
Very entertaining matchup. I really hope we can squeak out the win.
Sure but the news article with [NAME] vanishing has been there since the very beginning.
What a crybaby. Don‚Äôt drink and drive.
What changed that you think it's not as bad? They didn't do anything to the map unless I'm forgetting something.
It happens to me in relatively short streaks last one 13 days and I noticed it was a bit yellow
I know your not serious because your not looking whole corpus Here‚Äôs unique ones only found within [RELIGION] tradition
There is nothing more statist than socialized and compulsory education. They subsist on violence and perpetuate violence. These people are the clergy of the state.
[NAME] looking like [NAME] out there
Maybe you don't know that other parents are staying because you're not there?
Really hoping this is a smokescreen and we just go BPA then take Fromm next year
hey uhhhh I love you
I didn‚Äôt misinterpret the comment. There are kids in the truck. Watch the video with sound.
That's not even deconstructed. It's just unassembled.
Maybe don't pick something quite so obscure.... But my girl does
"What ""same thing""? You're not addressing any of my actual argument and have barely been doing so for a while."
[NAME], I love these kinds of threads.
What a good pupper
I like having roads, schools, and drinkable water? You confuse a man for a paranoid.
You obviously never seen the MLS playoffs, they make cubo [NAME] look like [NAME].
Maybe crazy dude is looking to bring water to [NAME] in the 90s-set Fresh Off the Boat. Something about [NAME] does it for me too. /s
Where‚Äôs the, ‚Äúthis‚Äù *clich√©* bot!?!? Also, good on you for choosing a less stressful life.
Dont forget [NAME]. He was a reliever converted to starter. Hes got some ridiculous pitches just needs to work on consistancy
Literally all I wanted was some sort of evidence and somehow I‚Äôm wrong...? You‚Äôre too stupid to be real.
They laughed in our faces for a decade. Not to mention they were actually cheating (bountygate).
Oh i wasnt trying to imply that he was a bad father. Its just this is America and hes a man.
Someone just needs a hug
I want one of those so badly! Perfect bag, perfect color. And of course they‚Äôre not for sale 
There you go, the familiarity was nagging at me
its becoming increasingly concerning that you refer to yourself in the plural.
Goddamn I‚Äôm excited about this football team!
Dude, nobody wants to hear about your stanky feet this early in the morning 
Sadly they aren't in control. [NAME] is and he'll always do the worst possible thing.
At least not on that day. Come back next week and maybe he will be here to give a speech at our store to rally the masses.
Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
the veteran‚Äôs name is [NAME]. news article
So much fake news.
[NAME] üòÇ I‚Äôm sorry they weren‚Äôt as expected but thank you for sharing! I had a good giggle.
Bro, he left his team in the middle of the game... idc what argument you have with [NAME] you still left your team.
I love this drink.GIF
"BEN ""[NAME]"" LOVEJOY!"
It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use ‚Äúkicks their trash‚Äù. I guess they just don‚Äôt want to swear.
I read through this whole chain and your patience is absolutely commendable. Good on you for explaining it in such a level fashion to someone so willfully ignorant,
[NAME] is incredibly loyal.
And then the sock goes into the unknown unprepared and gets lost in the washing machine.
i'm just making fun of how when moids say they like personality they dont really mean it
Sweet thank you!
Seeing that knife on this subreddit put the fear of [NAME] in me
It is much more fun in story mode
For both of you together? The fuck company are you using.
[NAME] can hear you over the internet, don't be so loud
Ha. Do you have evidence of his cheating? Send it to his family and don‚Äôt say another word.
Thanks, never heard that one.
#RejectingIslam because it is the *ideas* [RELIGION] promotes that turned me away from it.
Media City Building maybe? 1 Heerengracht St, Cape Town City Centre, Cape Town, 8000
Having two world class GKs is amazing lol
Oh fuck I almost forgot to jerk off and smoke weed today. I'm so forgetful. Appreciate the reminder.
I actually enjoy doing this on my own. Am I weird?
Yo this [NAME] was literally pulling moves out of the Hitman games jumping over to your balcony. Thats terrifying.
Orange man bad.
Leader is an aura perk so you can't be affected by it yourself, you can only affect other people with it. 
You realize I hate trump right? You‚Äôre super annoying I‚Äôm not dealing with this
Recover well. (Argh, my english is too terrible üá≤üá´)
When I was in Uni I worked in a call centre. Pay was better than retail but it was worse on the soul.
But this was a supposed psychopath attack, which can happen to anyone, not a rape attack that mostly happens to women
I am happy to receive constructive advice. If someone is short, or not constructive, I will react to it.
Well [NAME] made me laugh
It‚Äôd be nice if they tried to play defense
Peak Ancap
Honestly I don't care if they're faked. It's an original concept that I find pretty funny
Gotta eliminate the competition. It's Just Good Business.
Apologize to [NAME]
In that I should not have posted it or it's just really blatant
"[NAME] is like ""Mine! AALLL MINE HAHAHA"""
He's basically telling the Lakers to come and get him
It'll still be beautiful! They'll just have to be prepared to get a bit damp!
Erm... Maybe he wants you to use those toys... On him.
I‚Äôm an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning.
Thanks. I'll let him know he needs to step his game up.
Nets well run? Should I being bring up the trade?
I am getting so nervous watching this
supa mario brothas 2 ya bitch
I'll be there! Should be an interesting foray into STOs, and is a sign of what is to come. 
He‚Äôs your rebound guy. Have fun. But expect little. And certainly don‚Äôt expect it to last.
Thanks for explaining it! I‚Äôm not sure why my comment got downvoted. Without context, it makes no sense.
Wtf are you taking about? What does that have to do wi- *checks post history* **OH**
True love, that's the way to go right there. Sex, drugs and Rock 'n' Roll
If high calorie food is so cheap, eat less of it and save even more money without getting fat.
Lmao. I fucking love this community.
I like this story way better than parvo.
I like [NAME], but I'd just rather spend more time with [NAME].

Montreal is a beautiful city
[NAME] misses weight by 30 pounds for his fight against [NAME]. The fight still takes place, and [NAME] wins a unanimous decision 
Now this REALLY sucks
Man if you want some crazy dreams, slap on a few nicotine patches before bed.
Love how he stops and embraces the pole.
my good woman, I'm not sure that you handled it poorly
Had a baby before, those movements should be the last of your worries

Happy to see that you're in recovery
Why can‚Äôt we do both, approve wall funding and more border agents now and stop holding 800k federal workers hostage. 
My least favorite couple: [NAME] and [NAME].
Tf happened to him? You just said thanks LOL
Reminds me of this classic
Actually it's quite hard to decide without a proper reason. Under what circumstances do we have to do that?
Yeah I knew that. I was being hypothetical.
Yes. Combined.

I regret that I understand that reference :(
Thank you! Completely agree.
Pretend you are the lead in a movie. You will probably get laid, confidence is everything. Bingo bango, great night!
Completely serious here, what do you base that claim off? Like, from experience and talking to people or from a larger scale example?
Here's a way to help. Have sex with a user
This isn't uplifting. This is *enraging*. This is what the government should be doing not nine-year-old fucking children.
What was the original post? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply!
Good guy for real.
Cheers to a better 2019 for our boys!! Can‚Äôt be much worse then 2018

Great post! : )
Poor thing. Her arm looked stuck in the crutch as she fell. That had to hurt
It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.
Just commenting here to give you a notification :) Have a nice day now

I'm sensitive! :'(
I thought you and the other person meant turtles. Which really confused me
On the surface, yes. Deep down, probably not.

It‚Äôs shocking if you‚Äôre a bad electrician.
He's just a money grabbing midget

All mutations are potentially harmful. Especially if they replicate. But we can't control random mutations, so why not worry about what we can control.

I wish [NAME] nothing but the best. I certainly won't ever forget his passion for the Mets.
Agreed, but it took me a while to understand that.
That would never pass since every side would get what they want. There has to be a loser in his eyes
It's already a thing though lol
Sri Lanka gives a 99 year port lease to China? Didn't England have one of those on Hong Kong?

Old timbermill. Was that the long payload defense and attack?
Oh, it's definitely working and that worries me a lot. 
While lifting, loving yourself, and just being confident bro. 
I meant the first part. The second part was uncalled for.
It doesn't cost money to organize. It costs time, effort and concern for your country.
You have one of two options. Let people sign up voluntarily and treat them as brave men and women or bring back the draft.
OMG I‚Äôm dying she said carrot!!!!
You‚Äôre allllll alone [NAME], lmfao.
that's ace, thank you so much 
I'd still think he is scum. And needs to be imprisoned.
How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.
Safe rooms and hidden passages, I hope.
I could've done without the bottom right pic.
Bold of you to assume I have anyone that I would want to date in the first place
hahaha, this is great. We need more anarchist jokes.
It wasn‚Äôt significant.

Frankly, I'm continuously shocked that more than 35% of the population actually think he's doing a good job. 
At least you supported a talented artist :3
Your mental health. You might think its fine, but having to live a double / fake lifestyle is wearing on the best of us . 
Damn, [NAME] us just 2 steps behind all the time. It's just a matter of time before he gets some great shots in.
Can confirm. My downvote was removed. Added it back just now. Edit: My mistake. It was a different video.
This is going to be a disaster

Falling for such low quality bait
too much logic in there for remainiacs only interested in cheering for unicorns and insulting the british people.
*The Panic Virus* by [NAME] is a really interesting, well-researched book about the rise of the anti-vax movement.
Lol there you go. Forgot to switch back from your alt for a second there.
Fine as long as the experience is not frustrating. Problem is not balance problem is it‚Äôs not fun
> mopey?Like Droopy? Ah well maybe
Great anime though. [NAME] awesome.
Yeah sorry about that I don't mean it.
I'm at a fighting game tournament and loving every minute of it.
What's awful about it?
Yeah, sure, but it's beatable. It's made to be beaten, not otherwise. That's what I meant with my speech.
Thanks! We had fun.
Good luck and have fun

I have a coworker that had a similar problem... turns out she needed surgery to clear out her sinuses. Once she had the surgery things improved significantly.
That's...not at all what I said. I said I *hoped* they would tell me. [NAME].
Should probably go see some sort of doctor tbh.
Oh ya, that‚Äôs [NAME]!

I completely agree, I just think there is more of a chance of Clowney getting tagged than [NAME] getting tagged a second time.
Is that her phone in her back pocket?
She‚Äôs had her ass pounded before.

The greatest out of context quote ever.

Venezuela should be one of the wealthiest and influential countries in the world except their infrastructure and society is falling apart due to centrally planned economics and socialism.
Eh, semitic semantics...
I enjoyed this nearly as much as I enjoy too many pints.
Nobody is mad about that.
You can just go to their subreddit and there's a lot of things people are saying that we've been saying all these years.
HAHAHAHA I'M AN ASSHOLE
Really rude move to do that in the rest room though.

If you manage to accidentally do that you have bigger worries than the sound to think about.

Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.
And I'm happy we all agree it's deathcore.
You're happy that survs DC when you play killer? I'd rather actually play the game. Legion mains are weird sometimes.
[NAME] reinforces the pessimistic world view, I've been there and at least it was cancerous for me. 
If you don't like margaritas get out of the salt mine!
Wow interesting to hear how the cops responded. Glad they actually tracked the car down!
PIN IS TOO SMALL TO FIT 20 PEOPLE! #NEXT!

I think I‚Äôll go ahead and continue criticizing silly unfounded and harmful beliefs
This is great! Can anyone make a request with you to draw?
While [NAME] lighter take on [NAME] in Justice League was questionable, I enjoyed him in BvS. Excited to see who takes on the cowl next.
It‚Äôs a wonder [NAME] didn‚Äôt get more duis with the amount he needed to drink
But who is filming him?
which is the fault of the people they voted on :D
Oh well maybe your cousin gave his account info to someone lol.
You can‚Äôt say that that‚Äôs racist!!!!!!

Ah Princess [NAME], the [NAME] of our childhoods

Lol I know right?
Lol, this one‚Äôs great too!
no you should try again
Thank you!!!
Everyone who supports him knows. The [NAME] need educating.
I'm worried that [NAME] throwing away a future career by running for President.
This is awesome. Makes it feel like a community rather than just a forum.
Kinda similar to the Pistons, they're stuck in a bad funk after getting off to a decent start. Now lost 10 of last 13.
The fact that 34 thousand people upvoted that painting truly blows my mind
Yeah I‚Äôll take my downvotes. Just a gut feeling
she disrespected [NAME], i dont like her
And I also appreciate you.
[NAME] also tends to out vote [NAME] in polls in my experience
Being too scared of calling someone isn‚Äôt a disability for fuck sakes... use some common sense and grow up.

this 'bug' has caused me countless death... i always used rifle primarily and switched to shotgun after rifle shot
I'm sorry, when did a subreddit become a sacred institution? That's a false equivalency.
Why wouldn‚Äôt you want as much exposure to the idea of this protest as possible? It‚Äôs an incredibly important issue.
Yes I‚Äôm in a 2 bedroom now with a lot more space and yes they live in Virginia but they live in the Hampton roads area
Oh sweet! I'm a bit farther but go into the city all the time. I'm around 50 min by train.
We still ended up with [NAME] at the draft though.
Have to agree. The government welfare and biased divorce courts which are enforced by the state are to blame.
Nope this was Saturdays sunset :) I wish I was out there today for the sunset!
The rest areas and truck stops are booming!
She looks like a televangelist.

our boi famous
I love the jab berto. It‚Äôs literally in thin air.
Blockbuster was so overpriced compared to local stores though. It was always a last resort for my family.
The situation never should‚Äôve gotten to that point.
I wanna see her debate [NAME]. He would shit all over her.
You can't expect him to like food
I see it this way also. I have never played Pokemon Go but I feel like DD creates the same excitement.
Didn't notice the date, sorry.
I feel like they would look at one of the Spurs assistant coaches if they were to part ways with [NAME]. That or maybe [NAME]
Run, run Run for the roses Quicker it opens Sooner it closes Man oh man oh friend of mine All good things in all good time

I agree with this coked-up fiend.
By the way the dogs also alerted at kuss road but will just ignore that much like [NAME] did lol ciao
This whole sub makes me sad.
I would prefer this over her being a completely random person, which makes no sense and was a tremendous misstep in this family saga.

the screw i need is different than what they sell. we tried.
Same. It's rare we get rain, might as well enjoy it. I sure did during yesterday's hike.
I could honestly just go without intermission interviews altogether.
Imagine being the assassin who could boast that he killed a president with a shot to the genitals.
Not sure, can't really feel anything from any other memory that had strong emotional ties 
I like gorgeous men with huge lovely penis
And we know how [NAME] ended. [NAME] should run away like now.
Chiropractic is just a scam anyway, lots of studies shown it has no effect, sorry that happened to you btw. 
Lots of hugs, kiddo ! They ***are*** heifers !
She already received $750K from the school. And she'll be in debt to the state for the rest of her life.
No if anything the exact opposite. Couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth
Then how can you say the rest is very red outside of nova when that is blatantly not true?
Wizards really embracing the tank, having [NAME] playing the 5 against [NAME]
I was surprised when they sewed them together instead of hot gluing them.

I'm with you. Would this news surprise me? Absolutely not. But I'm not believing anything regarding this subject unless it comes from [NAME] himself
He got It from his moma
Good layup [NAME] now just try not to get completely lost on defense haha
A lot of times the only thing holding any of us back is ourselves. It's not too late to start writing either.
None of these people ever seem to have run their own business.
Funny. I take mine out of the hair tie and leave it down or in a loose clip.
So you spectate all the people that kill you? Stop talking bullshit.
"That's even cheaper than I had figured.. there's still the ""to you"" bit... OP needs to post an Amazon wishlist."
Best comment ever.
Hahaha thanks for sharing that is simply amazing. You probably gave the buyer a good laugh too.
Imagine insulting your wife and father then you carry water for the same person. [NAME] is a basic....
Well it doesn't matter anyway. Ignore compliments; they don't help you.
I would see a doctor asap and get to a psychiatrist. Hallucinations of any kind are worrisome.
That woman on the left with red shirt and blue jeans looks really calm
> I really hope QCX addresses that last point. Who knows [NAME] could've fled with the money or something. What the hell dude. lol
This will get us focused and we‚Äôll play hard with a vengeful attitude next couple games
Folks, the Baconator is great! Ask anyone, it's the best sandwich. The bacon is amazing. Great sandwich.

I would shoot a cop who shot my animal. Save the consequences for later, you just assaulted and possibly mortally wounded my best friend. ACAB
Lots of us in Texas. Dallas is a nice mix of moderate conservatives, libertarians, and moderate liberals. I like it here.
[NAME]: So, I hear you guys are doing video tributes now? [NAME]: That's what I thought...
It serves as quite a lesson to anyone, don't you think?
It would be a little less irritating if the 10 cents you pay if you want some paper bags didn't go to the government as a tax.
C-USA when it had [NAME] was pretty awesome.
You need to tell the poor girl it was you not her lol
Where'd you go tough guy? You were talking so big before. Way to downvote and move on punk.

When is that? There will always be supporters who don't support the players.
My empathy to you.
As an Aaron Jones owner, I did hate [NAME]. Lol but I‚Äôd still like the hire and just pray he becomes more innovative.
Stranger than fiction. Can't even begin to comprehend what that poor [NAME] was going through.
Even if I would get 100 bucks for downloading and playing I wouldn't touch this crap piece of forced romance with baby inside.
I loved it too! I think it doesn't really mean anything and it was just a hommage, but anything can happen in Riverdale. 
It would be funny and sad if he gets heart complications again
He was afraid of flying
Thank you. You‚Äôve given me a beam of hope
We invest in other countries, in 250, 500, and 1000 lb bombs. Look at all our investments fruition's! 
not what his post history says
My best guess is because the wine in his glass is purple. Whether it was a purposeful [NAME] quote or not, I dunno.
Wow I typed that out before my eyes were awake üëÄ
Congratulations! Welcome to the world, new person!
You're on the internet, google [NAME]. 
I wish there was some way to put this in the sidebar.

I just want to say once you take action, stay safe!! Good luck. It‚Äôs the best to leave. 
Tell me about it. Never felt like I fit into this gen.
That's all [NAME] had to do with his egg, instead he decided to bathe with it to make things weird
No worries, thanks for replying back! Rotary means you teach one subject and see different classes instead of teaching multiple subjects to the same class :)
‚ÄúWe only let him jump around for 12 hours a day!‚Äù Wow. I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you.
yeah but [NAME] as well? unless she's significantly younger than him.
For goodness sake give [NAME] a rest. After the last game he said he was so tired from running so much.
This moment always reminded me of being a kid and turning on Nickelodeon only to find Nick News with [NAME]. Ultimate disappointment.
But for real. Like, phones, you guys. Am I right?
those kids hitting the recitation wobble got me dying low key
I‚Äôd tell her nothing, that freaking weirdo would just never see my kid. The End. Disgusting.
Good thing the races weren‚Äôt reversed otherwise we would be organizing a march or rally instead of having a good laugh.
And that he‚Äôs not white
Partial reopening within the next two weeks for services to the [NAME], but unfortunately for some a lot of the government is never coming back from this.

As someone who just drunkenly told his boss what everyone else said about him behind his back, I can agree. 
Ok! I like making friends
Not much of anything
Oh [NAME]....
Fund this man. Even if it doesn‚Äôt pan out it‚Äôs worth finding out.
And you were too stupid to find your own sriracha, or you thought that $7.50 entitled you to your personal dancing monkey.
I think someone else should open a drive through so I can enjoy the flavours without the dishes aha
of course not, [NAME] and [NAME] were great friends and anyway, he's been dead since 2016.
Good for you! So awesome!
Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
This is amazing!! I love it!
Can't stand people who spam their terrible youtube channels
Ah yes, [NAME] forbids us from judging those of the higher castes. It is known. 
This is so, so great.
You have no idea what you unleashed
Ive took a basket home by accident once... basket for life?
i already gave away too much of the secret it's relevant save yourself before its too late
Muppet. Nice not obscene insult. Thanks.
How strange is it that it is only gun control enthusiasts think that compromise means one side gets what it wants and the other side only loses.
My best friend missed the play using the restroom too. He thought there was a halftime-like break between the 4th and OT.
Be confident when you‚Äôre breaking the skin! If you hesitate, the vein is more likely to roll.
This level of naivety is off the charts
Thanks. Nice input as always.
I can't help it when everyone just loves us ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I got them, stagediving out the nosebleeds!
Im sorry I said something negative about your beloved Valve.
Yup [NAME] is who me miss. Anyone notice though that his little southern twang ramped up to about 100x more when he went national?? Lol
We've got [NAME], [NAME]. I don't think [NAME] understands....
Just don't cross the Tigers, hmmmm?
Yikes, what a loony bird.
I hate to be that guy, but there are 6‚Äô0‚Äù + women
I didn‚Äôt know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D
Yeah I sympathize with this sentiment. The flow of Michigan fans into the cfb subreddit this year was overwhelming. Even as a fan I was irritated.
While this makes me happy to know, it would probably be for the best if we didn't post these things where abusers can find out about them.
Which is fair. But they're not respecting you.
[NAME] looks so much older though.
if my dog dont like u i dont like u and if my dog gets into a fight u know im jumpin in there with him
that is a rather attractive cartoon man
That anamie pillow is a three-dimensional object...
Pot of boiling water. Bears don‚Äôt know how to carry any of these things so it will probably spill the boiling water on itself.
Power to the people!
Of the 7‚Äô1 jacked guy. Yes
This could have been way worse.... the bottom pic could have been [NAME] and [NAME] ughhh
some men sit to pee. men also get attacked and feel vulnerable in certain areas. the more you know.
Gotta think [NAME] was also tired after all the hard work they put out Most likely it'd be easier for a fresh player to run passed players
Probably because its likely, unfortunately. The question is what happens next for people that are obsolete.
You should. Come on man.
This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet.
it's ok to need an equal partner
Ok. Good idea!
OP sounds like you need to wait a sec for the aim to focus.
wow fkn nice :)
LOL at this question! If he follows the sub...just read the topics for opinions! I call BS!
He can‚Äôt be like that in that business but it already sounds too late. No wonder his staff quit on him.
Whatever the customer doesn't finish, they save and put it back out and serve it to another customer. Confirmed by former staff.
Yeah thank you you ungrateful bast.....
I see this a lot on Reddit. Holding a dumb view, dying on a dumb hill just to finally not respond to a breakdown of claims
The best, besides the hundreds of other games that are better. You know, like how Mcdonald's has the best food in the world. 
It was just for a short gag
Because [NAME] was playing awful in the first two sets. Absolutely terrible.
Lol stfu really
Is your friend a carny? It‚Äôs okay if they are in just curious?
Totally looks like
That was like a movie the way [NAME] and [NAME] were slaying on the enemy ship with Cobbobles firing canons from their ship.
Most people should owe money, unless they are driving for way too little pay. 
I feel you girl
Prove your faith-based claim.
Unfortunately they do at times, but it's not the case in this video.
Alllllllllmooooooooost got ittttttttt.
You can, up until you proclaim scotland is a spectrum.
[NAME] - Holdin on. Check out his music because he is honestly amazing.
It's gonna be somewhere between 25-30 overall, who cares
But that jumper looks hella cosy
Now is the fun part, where you try to maintain this lifestyle.
Brave soul.
Haha, this is awesome, this sub is usually full of terrible stories, it's great to hear a nice one once in a while.
Like I said you are right about everything. don't call 911 ever they aren't showing up unless you have a credit card. good luck
sounds good, take care & stay safe lovesüíï
The real reason [NAME] hates pewdiepie
this made my day/night. thank you
Idk, I'd say the screams of government pawns dying is a pretty cool sound effect.
This is the video that finally got me to watch the pilot just to see what stupid thing [NAME] will do.
I'm sick of them eating my cheddar.
You think they're going to actually compost it or just toss it in the garbage?
Oi he got stabbed in the eye
‚ÄúTo put us all know who [NAME] laughed through it all.
We‚Äôre playing well, except for a 2 minute stretch. As is tradition
Except they miss most of those too.
funny as.
Takedown's not a terrible pick on Nuxia though, so that's something.
I was born in 1980 so the 90s were my teen decade. I loved it. Best decade ever
Jokes on you..he's in cahoots with the guy at Oxford...
Old ladies are like the only ppl that are nice to me lmao. Kindered spirits with the ugly.
Yeah but they actully had/have shit to be mad about. Their board is incapable.
And.. she... is.... GONE.....
Well obviously not. Some people have higher tolerances than others. That‚Äôs a fact. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you.
I‚Äôm not signing that üòÇ dude can hopefully stay banned
Some of my best rolls were with 50mg. Less is more!
So, about that weather.
Like [NAME] and [NAME]!
Everything can be turned into a fetish, why right now someone could be jerking off while watching paint dry. 
Tiny long whiny mewl. Hangry doesn‚Äôt happen for another 6 hours.
Thanks, I'll do that next time. I didn't mean to get blood on it after all.
Pointless but fun
[NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
bruiser sylvanus is so op for the first 20 mins, its ridiculous. underrated support.
doesn‚Äôt mean you could assume you committed a crime
Oh god I thought he career was long over
You really can't. So just dont worry about it
Any other reasonably priced recommendation?
Just don't stop with the damn good cooking though please lol.
He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!
Bingo, low tax zones around his mines
put on some real filthy porn before running errands, that'll leave the parents with having to answer really awkward questions 
Don't let the bed bugs bite!
Do you have any data to suggest this?
The title gives a pretty good rundown in my opinion.
Heh, [NAME] costume love is being triggered.
Rumor says he failed the medical. Probably false but this is Arsenal anything can happen.
Not the entire party
You're clearly upset tho, you're not doing a good job proving your lack of caring
Lmao no fun allowed
That‚Äôs wonderful to hear. :) I hope you get your guy!
[NAME]?!?!?!
It looks like a quail egg and it‚Äôs actually on a plate a weird looking plate but still a plate.
Yes, and it's also possible to have sex without involving a dom/sub dynamic.
Wrong. You tried to use a WW2 example and it backfired on you.
Its to hard to write for [NAME]?
Oh [NAME] all the cereal will be stuck soaking in milk until they get mushy and gross
And go where? That McDonalds üòÇ
She likes sending nudes? I mean, just go with the flow and see what happens. 
"""Human, there is something wrong with my water."""
Well, I can't speak for the right; I'm on the left.
Getting the second one out of the way as well üôÑ
Two posts to tell me how incredibly non-triggered you are.
Yikes - I'm so sorry things fell apart for you and imposing a sudden hierarchy on you like that was completely crappy on their part.
Done, sorry about missing that before.
All fair enough, but you should start just cleaning your dishes straight after you use them. You'll be much happier.
Right? I‚Äôve never heard of it being made with French dressing.
No. These are the people who loved someone with BPD, but got used/abused/abandoned by them. It's mostly romantic relationships. Family tends to be on r/raisedbyborderlines. 
Hang on so Im not allowed to stroke your dog? Thats sad.
never, because I actually married someone I wanted to be with l, and didn‚Äôt fucking betray their trust, unlike you arseholes 
Hey friendo nothing down here but there are ALL SORTS of interesting smells!
Weird crowd.
Spaceballs the suit case nuke, the kids love this one.
Ah, the other kind of dog.
This was probably one of the best videos I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit. What an amazing story. Job well done. RIP Chief.
And any form of bottom up government is also extremely susceptible to corruption. Basically, humans suck. 
Wow. How many beds is 22 wards?
"Had to watch ""Elmo in Grouchland"" one time too many when my kids were little...musical Elmo / Oscar overdose..."
I think it's time to let him go, for your life's sake!
Then be happy for that. If you gave friends that means they care and you can build off that yo have a decent life.
So true.
this study is bull but only cos my waist is just 2 inches larger than my head and im still dumb as hell
I saw [NAME] recently with [NAME] and it was bangin
> a hug from [NAME] That‚Äôs a bit too big of an ask, fam. 
This is a great coming out, I also which it went this well for everyone üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
See as sad as I am I can‚Äôt hate anyone here.
>Focus on yourself and do stuff to please others!
I just relapsed after a 15 day streak.
My sister squeezed a lime in her milk when she was 12. Same thing happened, but we told her it would happen AFTER she did it ..
I AM COMPARING THE TITLES YOU OVERGROWN CABBAGE
The only problem with this plan is that [NAME] won‚Äôt survive that long, lol
THIS IS NOT DETROIT, MAN! THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL!
it's ironic you are identifying with the nazi character lol
[NAME] the new [NAME]
That could be a quick way to see the next great Orlando big man end up in LA, haha. 
Educate yourself! Stay in your lane! (It all sounds so totalitarian if you look at it more closely.)
There is nothing gross about being gay. Just means we're different, but we still experience love. Love is not gross.
I try and avoid that entire mall. Hahaha
and how much time did it take?
username definitely checks out
Poor attempt for karma I think
I was wondering the same thing?
Perfect. Thanks!
LWX YOU SEXY BEAST
I love how happy he looks while listening to tool.
Thank you.
Good to know! Very much appreciated ‚ô•
yes please, would make thing less overthinking and stressful 
OP literally said guys like [NAME] are not unicorns and not hard to find. They never said [NAME] was the ultimate standard lol
I hope you‚Äôre okay! I‚Äôm so sorry that happened. I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt work in gastown anymore
This game is on [NAME]...
I‚Äôm sorry on behalf of all the idiot guys. They didn‚Äôt take my class. How Not to be Creepy 101.
Also wanna point out that it‚Äôs just for like 10mil+ iirc
Not a Fan if anything FFXiii but I loved this game. Hope we get a season 2.
Its the same processus for LoL isn't it ? Haven't played lol for a long time but i remember using golds to unlock characters too !
It seems like that‚Äôs what a lot of people are expecting.
My biggest fear is catching feelings. I got dangerously close once lol. It‚Äôs just about self control.
This is -- and I say this in all sincerity -- the _weakest_ troll attempt I've seen in years.
In the comments he accuses the account of being fake and she proves her identity with photos and a link to her instagram. This guy is astoundingly pathetic.
I played on the Wii and used Windows XP computers up until 2011 lol. The feeling of the 90‚Äôs died in 2001 but the pop-culture remained.
Some [NAME] are. They're normally the tumblr type tho
No it‚Äôs definitely you. Time for you to grow up.
Omg lala a housewife I can‚Äôt even imagine!
Also 24 years old. I'm that old and it's odd.
Guys it's a dril tweet, false alarm
Something is rotten in Deutschland.
This is why bars should have poly nights. It would be nice to be in a room of like minded people, maybe they will talk to me.
You need to see a feeding specialist. Outright refusal to eat to the point of starvation is almost always a serious issue.
Livin life on the edge man
> Do you accept evolution? Depends on the denomination.
Good luck to you all. You don't owe your dad anything, don't let anyone guilt you into seeing him.
Hey! Go fuck yourself, you capitalist apologist bootlicking piece of shit
Ah, that's a tryptan, that can have more pronounced effects indeed.
They fully divorced? I thought they were just separated for now
Or they freak out if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot the right sub‚Äù for your post. Like calm down
I've seen this multiple times and wonder what happened to her after this.
But it looks so cute
> Best ~~3pt~~ shooter fucking ever. FTFY
Still can't see. Thanks.
I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
I can be hard on KAT at times but boy am I glad he signed here for 5 more years
Such season 1 vibes and I love it.
Eventually I would have to land another queen to stop the target from arranging marriages themselves.
It‚Äôs more of a vibe tbh I love playboi carti as much as I love [NAME]
Because what you described is the definition of the job.
Still saddened by the fact that we never got to see prime [NAME] vs prime [NAME].
Nobody likes you nonhuman mimics and everyone knows what you are.
No.. This dudes a little wack in the head
trailer fabulous!!! i miss it
This is quite common on people on such forums. I have a feeling they are a tad sarcastic.
IM ALL JACKED UP ON MOUNTAIN DEW
I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised.
Oh nice I have that one
I like it. But I'm not the most fashionable fella out here.
Oh wow. That sucks to hear about [NAME]. I guess not uncommon with a bad family life.
GET MORE GOALS FUCK [NAME]
[NAME] lol. I eat what I want.
Not to mention even if it was called and due, the WBC have said they would be happy with a unification first. 
Consoles can‚Äôt hit 120 fps in fortnite m8. You‚Äôd be lucky for like 90
Guessing you didn't read the article cause I ain't said anywhere that I think [NAME] should be fired and also talk about the roster shortcomings
Speak for yourself. YOU don't care.
We're not really meant to be close friends and have sex with someone without feeling anything. You're defying nature by attempting to.
*Fuck extremists.
But she told me she asked because of the post that I made
With that logic, a dad can't really be a parent either 
Wtf is that
Kinda torn. I want us to come back, but I also want us to lose bad enough to replace [NAME] quick
$17 for 299 Mulberry? I paid $15 in cash last game.
Lived this, it didn‚Äôt workout for me. Good luck on that one, I‚Äôd never do it again.
Four score and seven years ago, we and a jewel......
I'd watch out for the brother. He seems like the type of guy to try to murder you years from now.
I need someone one step on my long tail real hard right about now.
Reading this made me happy and I don't even know you. Keep doing your thing!üôåüèº
"""We've won the AFC less often than you have"" is a weird flex"
Thank [NAME] this was said, I feel 100% the same way. 
Make fun of them all you want; fact is they won during the regular season when we couldn't.
These made up phonetic alphabets these cops use drive me nuts...
The perfect response thou.
I suggest going to the food carts. Buy some legal weed. Enjoy the bars. Go to Washington Park.
"""I awoke several hours later in a daze...."" üòÇ"
Imagine being so retarded that you believe [NAME] is a sadist.
): hope the goose is okay ):!
Did insurance cover this? Who was the surgeon? Unfortunately without it...this surgery can cost up to 20k or more in American cities.
I won't stop crying üò≠
I like him 1.thats why I agree to go on a 2nd and 3rd date, 2. we text a lot. I just take things slow.
If you think he's working 2400 times harder than an average minimum wage worker then there's something severely wrong with your world view.
Wait, apple and [NAME]? Please tell me these fools are all on windows phones 
Its distasteful to complain about male-dominated space like stem? **pearl clutching intensifies**
Cheers, cheers_im_drunk_bot.!
Ohh I love bag designs
"> what **the straights** have > ... > **""stereotyping** Hmm"
Mayday mayday, I've been hit. The bot got me
You other than the fact one likes little girls and piss/ keeping them as slaves where as [NAME] paid all his girls
Congrats, you got pleb filtered
Okay thanks for the advice!
I've played around pretty extensively with this mod in [NAME] mode with friends. I'd recommend it.
Fuck so obvious
Yaaaay!!
Good work, friend. 
If you made it a goal to speak a word to him, then how do you know you are blocked?
I‚Äôd rather him act more like green arrow then [NAME] but I get what you mean.
[NAME] effect here we go. I watched it and didnt even knew of the show before.
Fair enough. I considered it malicious compliance because I followed the letter if the rules while purposely not following the spirit.
ugh. I love guild wars 2 but it has the weirdest god damn community and management dynamic of any mmo.
This picture is as old as Tinder. OP is probably a dog for all we know.
I always walked in the grass, man. Am I weird?
men who drink almond milk regularly have more ejaculate fluid and experience multiple orgasms.
Right on. I‚Äôll change my comment
As much as I like [NAME], losing [NAME] still has to hurt. He‚Äôs just so damn lovable 
That's a succinct explanation thanks!
The history of horrible things the federal government has done is well documented. The same way the federal government does it, with income taxes.
Cheers! *clink*
Funeral for a friend is a killer band.
Stick to smoking and snorting! Nobody OD's from doing a line of fentanyl. /s
Hopefully with in this day and age where there ar rapid technology improvements, this child will be able to live at least a semi normal life
I did that a lot as well. I always loved going with her.
 Change is hard. Find comfort in victory, even the small ones. Let that propel you to become the person you were destined to be. 
[NAME], they've turned into jerks.
Still no contest
Know when to shut up, you have to. Needs to learn she does. Nice job.
Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
whoops I still hope they press that legislation though
Sounds painful man
You can go on the offical league forum and look for people.
I bet we have a scene of the new girlfriend fighting with [NAME]
Okubo thanks JP/EU for their work over the weekend on the patch notes, and then EU doesn't post their patch notes :-/
Very insightful and tragic post, OP. Thank you for sharing and raising awareness as someone who has been through the trenches.
They never will until it affects them directly, and by then it's already in the end game for us :/
oh, that's nice. welcome everyone!
A billon more [NAME] saves and I‚Äôll have [NAME]!
Yeah that‚Äôs what I heard on Univision deportes earlier. I hope he chooses Ajax rather than real Betis
Oh... I'm sorry. You holding up okay?
"""I will do what I must."""
>Poly people look at the numbers and just see lots of opportunities ;) I like how that's put
Okay, I'll try to find one. Sorry about that.
I measure from where the back of the balls are. It counts. Especially if you tend to go balls deep anyway. lol
I am stunned
Chat Room or Messages??
I remember when I saw [NAME] cut off his leg with a Saw in a bathroom
Thanks üíô ice skating is also one of my favourite non-food fun things to do üòâ
Woah, cool!
Yep...this sub blasted me for hating the casey hire and still refuses to admit his big faults
Whammer!
Phew. We can safely disregard anything he says then. I thought he might be talking about another EU referendum. Cheers!
hahaha [NAME]???
I'm concerned they actually have to press a button. Why no dead man's handle?
There are plans to widen Parmer during the next few years.
For the most part yes.
So I suppose they‚Äôre more like the flying monkeys than the wicked witch?
What, is he gonna go back in time and swap himself with [NAME]? 
>Federal minimum wage should be closer to $5 That's a horrifying thought.
Closing in on $300,000 now, this stream is incredible.
Ok, I guess I gotta show some commitment, thanks!
you are two hot cuties, all the bestest!
Your grad school advisor is an old fashioned idiot You are not. You are great!
Was gonna hit you with the /r/gatekeeping for that elitist mentality, but you recognized your errors. Props. 
They're just misguided, useful idiots.
No real man would allow his woman to be even looked at by someone else, let alone allow another man to have sex with her
Thank you and your upvoters
Lol I know, gross right? I'm hate watching the tell all again right now haha
Collab on the way?
Third here. Oh, ok. Wow.
This made me laugh way harder than it should have
I really hope [NAME] is in mk11. Hes such an awesome character!
can I use I can't believe it's not butter because my boyfie doesn't make over 20k :(
For real. After I saw that, I just stopped reading. My eyes spun right out of my head. 
Points. I envy your luck! My matches generally range from 10k-29k :/
[NAME] is clueless please don't listen to him lol.
Not my sub not my problem
99.9999999% of sugar relationships involve sex. If you're not interested in sex, you should not sugar.
Thank you I appreciate it
LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
I feel like I just saw this in a meme...
Not sure about OP, but caffeine tends to make many people more anxious (especially those with a co-morbid anxiety disorder(s)).
Last 30 seconds where [NAME] and [NAME] were silent to listen to the crowd gave me chills. Such a fun game and team! Aho is my dad
Rec and Red just need to die as teams. Fucking joke of a performance here considering how much funding they are both getting.
We're not moving.
You remember this sub on the month of release? it was an absolute shitstorm
Yes you should tell them and report him to the police for dating someone underage and giving her cigarettes.
I guess. I respect the boots on the ground cops. They aren‚Äôt the ones coming up with these ridiculous policies.
Got 4 or 5 episodes in and didn't really care for it. Heard it gets better from 1st season on tho
I don't care, [NAME] tweets make me uncomfortable and I hate him!!! - Liberals
Yup. Hysterical bonding from ultimatums. Remember that time ultimatums created lust and desire...........?
I don't really understand this video and the motivation behind it. It doesn't make sense to me.
Wow, nice article. It must have been very informative in 2011. here‚Äôs the 2018 update 
Maybe some people are just lucky to have an amazing connection to [NAME]
ball just bounced up a bit as [NAME] hit it, unlucky. Need to test [NAME] more, he's really not that great
Thanks for the tip. Just sold 100K
we legally can't do that now mr. [NAME]
Thank you. I‚Äôm glad the club acted responsibly.
Yep, though we just had a cross on the stochastic RSI weekly chart, looks like the next four to six weeks are going to get nasty.
Did they name Gen X after all the porn they consume?
Hopefully it helps you keep your emotions in check rather than letting others control you, [NAME].
You lost me again, I don't know what sex selective imprinting is. Let's not get off track. Still waiting on definition. 
Yeah, this guy actually seems quite smart. (But a horrible and manipulative person)
2weeks ago?
I will always love [NAME] as a kid not knowing any other qb, but will always be bitter with him leaving.
And much like The Lions past, future and present it's not looking bright.
[NAME] bless u
I‚Äôm a fan of your awareness for others here. This sub needs more of that lately.
I‚Äôm anything but little you little puppy kicker
It's hard for me to switch between english and spanish in the same sentence, sorry I'll try to improve in the future
Rename yours to Fuck and let alphabetical order take care of the rest.
This would be a great meme format
Somehow I got banned for replying to a troll. The mods over there have itchy trigger fingers.
I cant believe we elected this goon
Still as confused as the rest of ya myself.
Luckily I never got sucked into Overwatch, because I know if I had I would definitely have an unhealthy amount of playtime racked up. 
I travelled for almost 9 years. Now I'm an auditor back home. So yeah boring.
Because they don‚Äôt want to pay for [NAME]
I'm not sure about bigger, but according to Google search algorithm, definitely as relevant.
How can a picture hurt?
Idealogues are annoying.
Me, it's too cute for words.
I love how this boxy things is made to scare (common every show use that joke) but the queens is not scare at all.
It seems some people on here don't like us disrupting their echo chamber.
Excuse me, I hate to bother you but could you please inform me what you find so aggravating about sea Lions?
But what if they have sons?
I just watched the entire episode. They never once hint that they were having an affair. That information didn't come from the show.
I didn't know that, thank you for teaching me something today!
he'll be hurt next year too
It's ridiculous people blind fellow faith here in algeria
> [NAME] doesn't even agree with you. What does she not agree with?
Access should be hindered it's getting destroyed.
I always love her reaction. She acts like life is over.
No they aren't.
I mean, it's just a happy birthday post
Did you just say suck a fuck?
Imagine the wild sex?
What the fuck I thought it was normal to pee before taking a shower and like not pee in the shower Especially if it‚Äôs a shared shower ew
Last refuge of serous fluids and the dreaded endometriotic nasties.
I hate [NAME] and [NAME] for what they've done to this franchise. And I'm growing to hate [NAME] as well.
Wait, this is actually a really interesting point. That could/should play a factor if he‚Äòs a legitimate candidate. 
Protip- just smell your damn food. Use your senses!
Agreed! Hopefully! :-)
It really is! I loved everything about it. I'm so happy my friend told me about the franchise :)
Yea, it's not often our announcers admit multiple times we should have got a PP.
Lol this happened literally 5-10 seconds after the screenshot was taken too
Terrible shade of lipstick she's wearing...
For reference
DayZ chemlights actually last for 3 IRL hours already, which is plenty of time to find new ones.
This is why im happy [NAME] is our owner. I don‚Äôt see him being a cheapskate
I'd be terrible at this, I eat so slow.
Ditto!!
Yep, this cunt again.
I can't tell if this is a happy or sad ending. üòê
A bunch of people gave reasonable, polite answers. You had to be a big ol' dong.
Someone tell me why they are out passing us they taking the game to us when we should be controlling the tempo of the ball to keep the lead.
He's know for making rhythms.
Amazing. You will defend [NAME] no matter what huh?
I'm on board the Saints hype train. [NAME] is an amazing QB.
Megagrindr, and I love it.
Lets fuckin do this
he's a fantastic director, i've actually never heard of memories of murder! definitely will add that to my to-watch list :)
That head pat and hug was the physical equivalent of ‚Äúoh my sweet summer child.‚Äù
Hell yea brother, Charlotsvile car attacker did nothing wrong Lets see how quick they scream hate speech
""" Alright Little orphan [NAME], it's time for you to start earning your keep around here!"""
Are those both not true statements? Everyone loves attractive people, even employers.
[NAME] and [NAME] can not be any further apart as QBs
Well come on out here, lil buddy. 
I love it. She really snapped.
The people that use the image and leave that braindead comment are sheep, nothing more nothing less.
never used nor needed a stasis rifle in any playthrough, I wanted to feel afraid and on edge Edit: Was my 6th or 7th btw
You just going into the posse menu and buy the persistent posse. It costs $200. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
Apparently, you'd want an Alberta with a censor on what we read. Bully for you.
And now you manage a gym on base ..or..?
I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.
I agree with in general with your perspective, but as someone who loves music--new and old--I gotta say, lil pump really does suck
> go build something. BCH devs are already building and improving a decentralized network! You should start doing the same!
 You're welcome, I think.
Ah [NAME] trying to save the faith by strawmanning amazing.
I've realized after more than 100 hours that you can dismount a horse without jumping off
You always choose mum bro. What are you thinking
My poor baby
Well she ran with a bunch of soldiers before anf so I would imagine she had a colorful education in these matters.
Not even if I worked there, would I attend her meet and greet
Thank you that‚Äôs very insightful.
I actually feel bad for your roommate, poor guy.
What are these words? I'm so confused.
Oh [NAME] is serious about trying to win this game huh
Manila and Mon√©t serving a lot of emotion for safe
Do they not have a tarp over them or anything? They just have to stand out there in suits and dresses getting soaked on national TV?
I was/am the same. I'm the one pushing forward with the divorce though. The feelings of loss and fear are overwhelming sometimes though.
oh lol Im personally a mess. I always have been.
So many downvotes. Reading comprehension, people
‚Äú1, personal space. 2, I like my personal space. 3 get outa my personal space...‚Äù
Just a minute, don't hang up!
"r/mildlyinteresting's stupid ""guys look at this thing I made aren't I cool??"" posts are the absolute worst"
[NAME] forbid I‚Äôm actually anti-war and anti-theft and want my vote (or lack thereof) to reflect those philosophies.
Nasty, pigeons are nasty.
Good luck!
They look like great bros, sorry for your loss <3
I think it‚Äôs [NAME]
Yeah, I completely agree. I was just making fun of this sub for seeming like they only want girls wear hoodies lol.
Took me way too long.
Boiled peanuts are my happy food.
If I told you, that would defeat the purpose of censoring. Let's just say it's clearly libellous.
I almost hit the arrow in the screenshot
She was such a pretty girl, she didn‚Äôt need to get all those surgeries. What a shame.
I loved [NAME] so much
Happy to help!
... but he LOVES you. Perfect.
Agreed, but I can't believe the bottom of the barrel just has double French doors opening into the foyer of yet another barrel.
You monster! Think of the children!
Alway protect yourself
It's not like UK monetary policy massively diverges from the Euro
[NAME] looked terrible that game. I was really hoping to be wrong but he came just as advertised by Hawks fans
Thankfully. We have highly responsible gun owners and our gun control is fairly effective. We have way less violence and people generally can still enjoy them.
Not probable, I study in the best university in my country, I don't want to stop at all
Frozen berries are fantastic. Put a few in some heavy whipping cream in a blender with a little sweetener.
You have been banned from the mickey mouse clubhouse for inappropriate behavior
True but stranger things have happened.
If we trade him I don‚Äôt think be will be a playoff team :(
Yes, once I even deleted my account because I was so nervous about down votes. Lately,every once in a while I comment encouraging good attitude.
Rule #6 - Always ensure there's a random stranger near-by that can wave you to continue on once your task has been completed.
Thank you for the info and source. My source is only from guides, experience, [NAME] videos, and [NAME] videos.
That's a great point that I never thought of before... possibly nobody has!
Creepy Yoda voicepack tbh
Lol hokay guy.
Underrated comment ü§£
Are you serious?
There was definitely 90s-drama-film-esque piano music playing when this unfolded.
"I workout to ""the grid"" a lot. It's a 20 minute piece that continually builds. Its wonderful."
I get scared just reading your flair
You‚Äôre repeating yourself now
Good puppy!
Ex-Marines are the best.
A Visa gift card is a type of Visa card, and you can return money to it just like you can with any other Visa card.
What a sweet ‚Äúwelcome to your new home!‚Äù
[NAME], you‚Äôre 12. Go do your homework instead of trying to be edgy on the Internet. 
My ego is pretty ok. My fun-o-meter is a little off and needs calibration probably, though.
Yeah, I do this too. It's almost comforting. I'm glad I'm not the only one.
Yeah that helps. Thanks :)
Motherfu... thanks for pointing that out!
That's a little girl, not a sandwich.
Unless I have to see if they look as stupid as their driving makes me think they are. Then I pull right up and stare.
It's scenes like this that make me remember how truly special this show is.
Many thanks!
No, of course, no one has ever had his best axedwarve decapitated in the first goblin fight.
This is dumb. Why is Detroit Lions infiltrating here.
Assuming this is true, frankly I'm surprised they were still allowed to have images of the [NAME] in their homes.
That's [NAME]!
It's called bipolar. And it's fatal
Thanks for this. I was about to relapse but am still going strong.
look at that gym! Id kill to have one with such a nice view
yes, also most donut shops like those are cambodian just fyi.
Now THAT is a murder by words!
You forgot shinobi
Did he just get fat? What caused him to fall off so much? It's amazing how quickly he flamed out.
I don't know who the hell that is, but I will gladly upvote your post because it's not a stupid driving rant.
Dangerously close to paganophile, so be careful of your spelling for fear of extreme confusion...
It's not illegal but cars insurance is usually primary and health secondary. Her health insurance will ask what caused the injury and likely subro against your auto insurance
sounds like you are a man who is uncomfortable with women's sexuality.
>they mark agencies with a sense of history even if they look a little weird Queue Michigan State Police Cars
Really hoping they move into the empty restaurant next to Nona Mia‚Äôs on Esplanade
Let's wait for January patch, and hope that your problems will be resolved soon. I have too much fun in this game right now :) 
Nah, I‚Äôm good, just trying to help you out. Have a good one
But little [NAME] might grow up to be one of them, no?
This girl was kinda like that. She would orgasm walking around if her jeans were too tight.
I remember when I started showering every day as a kid. Everyone's first thought was I had a girlfriend.
most conservatives have been pissed at cities in Minnesota raising the age to buy tobacco, I guess i'm a little confused on what you are talking about.
So happy for you :)
You leave [NAME] the fuck alone.
Go on Webtoons and look up Boo! It's sex. Great freaking sex ed comic.
How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir.
Oh [NAME] this is going to garner such hate hahaha
thank you! he‚Äôs a boob and his wife is a fool...
Obviously excluding shotguns..
AWIL, great movie.
Yep. Let him know. Weird awkward NOPE is better done online than in person
I love the bus so much.
Weird flex but ok
And people try to hold that against [NAME] when they should hold that against the Packers organization and Front Office...Their Front Office stopped trying, not [NAME].
They need a speedy guy to fish pucks.. Either get nylander or Hyman on that line.. [NAME] line deployment is brutal..
I‚Äôm happy I could help. Let me know if it works
My.. friend.. wants him to upload it, if he did!
Sorry for hopping on this. But anyone know of any bars in Hamburg to watch the match
Was thinking the same. But watching the fight, one time def had it
This is probably why you're not in a relationship.
Not this time
Cheers, dude! Med school was hard. I also was alone for the majority of med school but I kinda managed to finish it. Now to residency....
That creepy realization that everything [NAME] says is projection...
He‚Äôll have ptsd every time he sees a cheeseburger.
So you got a more expensive burger while following the rules?
"They didn't have a ""bullpen"" when they won the WS or when they went to the ALCS last year. They will get by as always"
I wish the camera showed the cops reactions and faces when it didn't work
No! That‚Äôs not how I meant it! Just trying to start a conversation & I love Tool.
No problem! I‚Äôm glad we can help. Hope it goes well
so fucking beautiful. so subtle, but so necessary.
Lmao quality.
Wow thanks. Was hoping to see more exact same moon pics for the eleventy millionth time.
best part was him tearing apart his Real shirt while walking out
Basketball is more entertaining than football
Hey look It's a Bernout from Potomac! Lol
Ugh. Nice season from him, hoping he can build on it next year and play a bigger role at the world juniors.
> Love is more important than some job. You can't be serious? Please tell me you're just joking.
> The makeup is very technically sound You have a point. I can hear it from here.
Compelling argument, in line with expectation
95 percent of polite society is just avoiding doing things that make people uncomfortable. Don‚Äôt act like it is unusual.
Right. All a delusion in order to control people.
I picked up smoking again thinking it would aid that void that is working. It just made it worse.
I told my mum and an ambulance is coming now. Thanks everyone
This is so wholesome üò≠üò≠üò≠
A lawyer is not going to disclose anything to random users, you guys are delusional
Nor is it easy to waste [NAME] career
I LOVE [NAME]. I truly do. I will be happy to vote for her, but pointing out clear differences is not negative.
That's interesting. As an orthodox [NAME], I woulda either kept using the offending term or avoided the name altogether as you suggest.
I had a total of 5 pet chickens. No way I could've ever eaten any of them. Glad that gfather confirmed that Banana Chip was buried.
You are nervous. Just focus on the other stuff my dude.
I love [NAME] and totally understand. I hope she and [NAME] are able to have their healthy baby.
I'm not sure losing billions in trade is in anyone's interest other that political zealots.
You forgot to add how you hated your job or had a sick kid or some other sob story that changed once you met [NAME]
Didn't know they were doing matches on smaller pitch in the combine to see how they do with less reaction time. Thought that was interesting.
could've directed them to the employees. it's not hard especially if they're 3 inches from you
BEHOLD THE GREAT GRAIN [NAME] BECKONS US TO ITS CHAMBER! FOLLOW ME MY FELLOW BIRDS INTO THE ABYSS!
[NAME] is that guy downvoting everyone who doesn't think we should draft him.
Could this be an indication as to how the majority of the country wants the law?
I like you. Hi.
>He was deeply and utterly insecure, and it was pathetic. He still is. And it still is.
Adults seem to get more huffy than kids, who do go to school on their birthdays.
Progressives Warn Against [NAME] Trying To Get Elected In A Sharply Divided Nation
I'm betting my kids in MoCo will be off. Edit - MoCo announced, my house erupted in cheers
Yeah, I am! I'll private message you a link to my profile. Thank you.
So you're saying [NAME] doesn't have a personal vendetta against me?
DeepRekt Chain! Oh man, the rekt on that chart is something to behold.
I wish I could forget about the redesign. Sadly reddit is adamant about reminding me all the time it exists.
You can't be worse than [NAME], your hired!
I find this aspect of the law so ridiculous. I suppose pepper spray is lethal to people with respiratory conditions like asthma or certain rare allergies.
People with autism are awesome. Atypical, interesting, passionate, expressive, and awesome.
Fuck a TD. I just want to survive [NAME].
That magazine cover after her first surgery was awful. She got a chin implant or something I think. Receipt:
I'm quite curious as to how recreational marijuana legalization will effect these rates. The first two factors are generally caused by alternatives of sorts to marijuana.
Wow, I wish we had info on which counties have it the worst. Was that in the article?
"Careful with talk like this, we don't want reddit to bring down the ban hammer on you or this sub for ""insighting brigades."""
okay im interested in joining the bare hands hunting posse
great day for him though, awesome story for the rest of the week
It was pretty good, I didn't have the patience to see *all* the endings myself but spoilers exist on reddit for the curious (; 
What‚Äôs worse is that the judge and businessman are old college buds.
I thought it got a nerf when the spirit got released. My bad. But I still stand by, healing against the legion is pointless. 
Man I hope someone got fired for that blunder.
And then you got a little vacation from work too! :D
Wow! I‚Äôve never seen so many deleted comments, and that‚Äôs saying something.
I‚Äôm still using a laptop from 2008, and until last month I was using a phone from 2013. Actually felt bad upgrading the phone.
Oh it's a well known phenomenon, unsure exactly what it is but I think it's a bit of princess syndrome with mental posho co morbidity. 
My class size until 5th grade was 6 students...wish I had more classmates back then.
Now I have to re-watch the entire series, thanks. 
youve never played against a good support [NAME] then
I'd love it if we could just put everyone into work camps as soon as they turn 12. Property come would be a thing of the past!
That‚Äôs pretty damn good
They really aren‚Äôt people. They were slavers. Civilized people should have only one answer to that sort of behaviour: violence and death.
All I'm saying is there is no way I would let one solo drop my whole team with a quad 0% chance
As someone who's been trying to break the bad eating habits, I feel you.
I was hoping they both were gonna hit the ground lol
So what's so funny about what you just said?
Ah damn it.
I reckon [NAME] is going to dump [NAME] and go straight to [NAME]. The old gladiator loves big Sammy.
Yes!!!!
Glad you enjoyed! Come on down on Mondays. We have trivia and all the burgers are $6!
I'm a guy and it's the same for me! I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. üòä
He didn't know to place them
Haha thank you! I do love a good tea.
But then how will I betray it?
Update: haven‚Äôt been banned yet By the way when I stop these updates I‚Äôve most likely been banned
I laughed at this 4 years ago.
You were disappointed in 2014?
There is obviously love here. Don‚Äôt give up. Talk to each other.
Wow, you folks sure are salty about losing the midterms! Pathetic?
Yes, that is exactly what happened.
I like you. You're smart, cheeky, and funny. Well played.
all good haha üëç
Dude, she had just lost her baby, too. 
No actually my therapist is amazing! I've just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I meant I'm worried the doctor will say that.
That is extremely uncomfortable to look at.
I thought he had it tattooed on like [NAME]
Or getting lucky. Most [NAME] have jobs so their must be a way.
It‚Äôs a rough time I hope your Ex wife gets better.
Haha, thats brilliant.
[NAME], 2020 OKC 1st, 2019 CLE 2nd For [NAME] and [NAME] A little filler required to get it done (possibly [NAME] or [NAME])
Just explain what is going on. But also understand the other people involved will probably be at least somewhat upset. No one likes plans cancelled on them
nothing I dont owe anyone any explanation.
"Every airliner is fully pressurized, even the hold. There's no ""partially pressurized"" aircraft. They don't necessarily heat the cargo area though"
That woman is on the fast track to being ostracized from that group real quick.
I live in the area, and I haven‚Äôt noticed the smell anymore the last few times I‚Äôve walked by there.
[NAME] got him on his right elbow, and even if he didn't refs will call that swipe every single time and [NAME] knows that
"nice IASIP refernece! ""made a pretty penny in boiled denims, [NAME] mostly."""
Anything is a dildo of you're brave enough
I have no idea if this is sarcasm...
And congrats on them being part of the 10,000 too!
I‚Äôm ashamed to look at how much time I spend on Reddit
Remind me about this on Tuesday and I'll have it looked into (the not being able to report part).
[NAME] gonna miss the game tonight because I‚Äôll be traveling to Phoenix. Give me another blowout win like the ones last week.
Wow those fruit turnovers look delicious id defo pay 3$ to have one
Thank you! Does anyone actually if you'll be able to buy this (outside of Japan)?
I want someone to take me to the hospital
Shut up, or you'll be tossed off the roof!
That's more of a problem with eating liver.
Lincoln Riley had no HC experience and only 2 years of P5 OC experience.
What does that even mean? What a uselessly vague statement.
This sounds like fainting. Get your blood pressure/sugars checked.
I learned that recently driving into SLC for the first time in the rain/snow. I couldn't see shit. 1/10 Was scary.
I agree. I‚Äôd love to keep [NAME] around but recognize it might not be possible.
There's a reason that the 'Best Girl' achievement exists.
This made me spit out my coffee. But I feel [NAME] is too regal. How about [NAME]?
At some point you just gotta say, that‚Äôs impressive. This isn‚Äôt that point. 
Seen the headline went straight to the list haha
Omg I had to crank my tv because I thought it was just low volume
[NAME] hasn't been found guilty, YET, but he has killed before and bribes every official he sees
But those are typically quieter and then I won‚Äôt need them üôÉ are we done
Thank you love. I really appreciate your input
Yeah would be exciting!
Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done
"Aaaand I'm still here. I don't have a alt account but whoever you reported I""m sure is alive and well. You're terrible."
She does seem fully committed. That‚Äôs just why I‚Äôm a bit confused. I‚Äôm hoping she does deep inside. Thank you.
Oh I don't think so. I like AOTC and am looking forward to watching a 5 hour analysis of it.
I have a very confused boner rn
Immigants! Even when it was the bears, I knew it was dem!
wait for spring, you'll see what's the raging boner season
This was one of the best Reddit reads in a long time... great job.
We have no other winger bro....
If it results in killing [NAME], [NAME] is willing to be merciful and hold his wrath back against the kids.
Yeah, I might have used the wrong word.
Everything on the internet is real and serious... Im here to be downvoted and laugh.
Purposefully hurt people. [NAME]. I don‚Äôt understand why anyone cares.
Please enlighten us
He's not the issue... They'll never see her coming at them!
Really looking forward to Mayeather coming out of retirement for the 5000th time
Wait his nostrils are plugged? Isn‚Äôt that the opposite of breathing?
I was reading up on that, sounds like the long-term success rate is similar too.
I think the general consensus in this sub is that he sucks and is the worst streamer on twitch.
There‚Äôs never been one person doing okay who [NAME] wasn‚Äôt willing to drag down.
Blocked in us
I rate [NAME] highly, so this is good news.
I used to. It was a common pattern that my thoughts would spiral out of control but somehow I grew out of it eventually.
That's a really good one too. I am pretty upset to learn how limited my vocabulary is
Yea thats high and here I loaned my brother 5 quid interest free for. A year, 3 yrs ago havent heard a beep about return. 
Aha, I didn't say that was a good thing.
It's absolutely beautiful
That's one of the reasons why I'm wary üòÇ
Not heinous for sure, but frustrating.
It's not like the picture looks bad. Wait, no, I take that back immediately. I can't unsee it now too.
Yo bud take a breather. It‚Äôs just b-ball
Shit she doesn‚Äôt want = ‚Äúcurated beauty box‚Äù ü§î
So many enablers!
[NAME] get better overtime. [NAME] would wreck [NAME].
I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts.
[NAME] is scary
Oy vey, [NAME] üóë is gonna be *pissed*!!!
lool chill fam, u aint gotta do him that bad
What is it that you are posting twice all over the internet again?
[NAME] looks to be making an impact to me
"Result of ""I have camera so I'm invincible"" syndrome."
The way she caresses that heart though....
And I like the taste
If you are in the northern hemisphere, you must subscribe to the [NAME] ‚Äúseasonal theory of lardons‚Äù.
Yeah...I mean I love him! But he is to smart for his own good lol.
Im coo coo coco crazy for you my chi chi cay cay cyborg aw aw arm!
We have seven fucking billion and more people bork every day !!
I read the second tier cast makes very little by comparison. So [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], etc
this is not bad
Shoot first ask questions later
No it‚Äôs mainly for the itching and Dxm tends to make you feel like hot in the head atleast for me and the Benadryl eliminates all of that
The only thing worse than this guy, is an actual vegan lecturing random strangers on why meat is murder. 
... or so the Germans would have us believe.
Exactly, if I recall right, the last tall forward in barca was [NAME] no?
I miss those lol
"I was with you until you said ""your truth"". No such thing, mate. This is just mispropaganda in the other direction. "
Would love for us to go to [NAME] and give them Tammy for peanuts with a buyback

Change the size.
üé∂Hello darkness my old friend...
Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
Damn. I want to see some of those comments!
Date women! (Honestly tho, it's better.)
u/1R0NYMAN is that you?
Good idea, thanks
That's probably percisely what they did... They couldn't get into the server still. I'm sure they have specific rules about delaying and pausing.
Yeah, this just sounds like the usual Seattle understatement.
Reminds me of series finally [NAME]. Serious and dashing.
I think I need to convince my boss to open a Beijing office! Why does using the accent feel fake here?
"""Cute dog, what's his name?"" ""[NAME]"" ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)"
"Can we not say ""Team [NAME]"" or ""Team [NAME]"" etc. That's too close to us style politics for my likes..."
Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?
[NAME] username xD
Let's go get you a Paunch Burger burger, soak up some of that toxin.
I lovee mazzy star sm, Flowers in December is my favorite song rn
I find that a normal chat in Chinese can sometimes have that effect too.
Think of his target audience. They‚Äôre the ones who are fooled by talkers, not thinkers.
Lmao implying it doesn't go hand-in-hand
Try some other banks, maybe smaller ones, and good luck! Maybe get that deposit up a bit more, and borrow less.
This is horribly disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
It had a rough start but it really came around.
I both love and hate everything about this
Came here to say this
Of all 3 trilogies the Prequels pander the most to children. Even with its monotonous political banter.

Couldnt they just play music through a speaker? This is hilarious
I say we get the pitch forks and make him have to sit in a wheel chair for real boyos!! Vigilante justice away!!
Except you continue to lose calories well after you finish running...so way off
This is gonna need a pt 2 now!
this is a truly remarkable and informative documentary, and well worth setting aside an evening to watch. 
They were pretty cool in, like, 2010, but then everyone seemed to realize that you could write on the wipeboard with the same effect. 
He didnt play at all
[NAME] has only lived for [NAME] and [NAME] for now but the choices have been fair.
Looks like you've never been to Paris! The worst toilet in UK is cleaner than Paris.
I love this guy. He does amazing impersonations. Thanks for sharing.
The website is still up. You want to see this. I've met the guy. He's super nice.
:) thanks on behalf of kiwi. He‚Äôs quite handsome.
would whip out meat scepter, but unironically
I like how not remove other things for stupid stuff and this doesn‚Äôt get removed
Done that. Body dysmorphia makes them look the same to me ü§∑
Tried to /r/woooosh but I guess I gotta take this L :/
That's amazing! I love this kind of thing. Birds flocking. Fireflies synchronizing.
That actually doesn't make any sense considering many college students work outside of school.
Exactly. Some ammo is already cheaper than that.
Make sure you actually try sativas. Don't just listen to people bsing about Sativa causing paranoia/anxiety etc.
HOW?!
2-4 minutes is not enough time to wash long hair. 10-15 minutes minimum. Stay strong!
Yeah, but what if he didn't have a camera? You see it in Russia all the time, which is why everyone has a dashcam.
I saw on article on the same day that a person testifying about youth level abuse also died in a car accident. Same day.
I‚Äôll be there later this year. Can‚Äôt wait.
Love how science doesn‚Äôt matter for human biology. What about climate change?
[NAME] I love you but there is a top 15 game on
Has anyone actually read the terms of service. I haven‚Äôt...üòî Is this a valid reason to break the contract I signed?
Thats who I thought it was tooüòÇ
I wonder if, as an added bonus, [NAME] ended the cameo with a dic pic. 
What‚Äôs the chemical make up of a word? Yea thought so genius lmfaoooooo.
Go to the bathroom
Takes a lot less effort to just say ‚Äúfuck off, buy your own.‚Äù
Congrats and best wishes. Build on progress.
If loving the Falcons along side my Vikings is wrong, *than I don‚Äôt want to be right.*

It's horrible and I love it and you should be proud.
Crackly bois.
At least the shots we're getting are counting. Edit : LIKE THAT WOOOO
It's [NAME]. He hates himself for never getting the coat into the basket.
I feel genuine sorrow for your family having to be associated with a cretin such as yourself
Yet again with the gross oversimplification of geopolitics as a romantic relationship. [NAME]... pops up each and every thread.
I never said they didn't test it lol, I said they haven't tested it on PTR, which they haven't.
[NAME] has become the best houseguest ever in 24 hours. We aren‚Äôt worthy
Fcking disgusting.
Your kind honestly need to fuck off out of Ireland. Nobody wants your dumb fucking antisemitism here
Looks like they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to keep the handle on
pretending the issue is your wife cheating on you is why you're not learning anything
It‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophesy. They know things are getting more violent because they are looking to make them that way.
No, the teens were not being assholes. The original sentiment that spread like wildfire absolutely does not stand.
It‚Äôs crazy how invisible, worthless internet points control us
I'm so jealous. I'm in NYC for a year and the lack of King Cake is giving me actual depression.
Thanks. I desperately need to connect with other women.
Hey, come on! You did me twice! 
I mean, it could work. I might be enticed by a slightly less ugly lady. 
Ya, because it‚Äôs funny and relatable
I love this place. I have multiple things from them, and the employees are super great.
Nice job censoring u/alexneverafter right there
[NAME] enslaved the [NAME] and MLMs enslave...well...everybody.
Just did that. He ignored me and didn't respond.
This is true, but For THIS situation, it's time to take notes on the situation and do better on the next one. She deserves better.
Not really, they can do what they've been doing and force a no deal brexit pretty soon...
what's an alt right?
i don';t know about that, it's probably aliens.

It's racism. It doesn't make me angry, it makes me feel sorry for their ignorance and yours.
I love military films, this was good. My theater was clapping when each terrorist got killed lol
I don't want [NAME] to lose her job is all. She's a rare teacher who loves her job and students once you help her out and all..
Coherence, The One I Love
Either you're very high, or don't know how to construct thoughts in the English language.
Whisper me your steam id but it'll be 1-2 hours until I can start playing
The man comes around
Maybe. Or maybe its going to make the US stay. Some peoole are saying it was done to keep the US from leaving syria.
I don‚Äôt understand why this is a problem? Each of you just plate up your own food and then eat together.
Thanks man, my brother and my girlfriend just told me to laugh it off; but the thought doesn't stop haunting me. 
I just actually listed it for trade haha. I can‚Äôt use paypal unfortunately as I‚Äôm under 18
Thanks a bunch!
It's a shame he didn't trust you enough to believe you, but instead believed his own assessment of what he was worth.
"For liquids I might leave the ""7"" out and make sure your citizens are the only race that can spawn in highly savage areas."
There is something terrifying about petite crazy girls. LOL. The scariest girl in my middle school probably weighed 90 lbs. Everyone was scared of her.
I'm actually amazed we walked away with 2 points. That 2nd was one of the worst periods I've watched. [NAME] stole that period.
More likely to rape??? Stats?
Fcuk you.
He's the best [NAME].
We can‚Äôt have that
John Oliver is a fucking liberal pig.

[NAME] and [NAME] not being signed yet is getting on my nerves, am i alone in that?
lmao... okay buddy
I'm good. Happy with my boyfriend.
Yep, it's all extremely frustrating.
I'm not sure they know the difference between a mandate and legally binding.
Well everyone is entitled to their opinion but I think you need to be a bit more mature about everyone having different bodies
You clearly don‚Äôt trust him. Separate before it gets too comfortable to stay.
Yup this game just gets worse and worse
I love this, my wife told me about something she read on reddit yesterday and I was like.... well just like ol [NAME] here!!!
Text ain‚Äôt a great medium for sarcasm.
Still very curious who this woman is and what she looks like
I'm glad to see when people succeed! I'm very happy for ya and life is going uphill which is always a great sign
I shouldn't be tanking this much rating after even a year bro. You don't understand how bad it feels to be in this garbage elo.
Is this the correct way to dislodge a train? It seems reckless.
What a great reason to have kids.
[NAME] first captained a Chelsea game at age 20
Ask him if he‚Äôd consider opening a makeup store if you gave him $6000
What about urban [NAME] supporters who are socially liberal and want to see tax dollars used efficiently?
Please share lol
[NAME]... why you do this?
Damn! I hadn‚Äôt heard about the eBay stuff.
[NAME] this was hard to get through. Please crosspost to r/sadcringe
Oh I got you. Likewise for us. I‚Äôll take a look later and name some names!
Thanks for the reply. And I'm not gonna do that, no worries. I just enjoy getting knowledge about everything on the earth.
What? Trolls? Actually, yeah, probably. 
Wonder how many people are walking around with slimey noses trying to figure out if this does work.... Besides me that is
Yeah but if you do have a problem you'll be faced with a very difficult decision.
Several of the scenarios in the ad were talking about intervening when boys were attacking/bullying other boys.
"It won't be anything with ""Last"" in it, because TLJ. But it miiiiight be something with ""Final"" in it."

[NAME] is the granddaddy of ROM sites. Check it out while you can, boys and girls.
Yes, but his function is unclear.
"Three words, no subtlety. ""Dude. Stop. Seriously."" "
He‚Äôs one of those players that you would love if he was on your team, but hate if you have to play against him. 
Thank you for responding with truth to a top comment that is intentionally very misleading
[NAME] keeps getting set to get a rebound [NAME]
It's crazy, the first day with icy, snowy roads it's scary but within a few days, grip and visibility sound like fantasy
I FFed it too and reading that comment, I am sooooooooo glad I did!
Underrated comment.
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
She refuses them by inhaling them [I'm sorry if that sounded bad plz no downvite]
There are plenty of cases of terminally ill people who elected to stop treatment and then pass away. You're not obligated to get treatment.
.5x speed. Every moment I enjoy would last longer and any time I find myself in a pickle, I'll have more time to react appropriately.
That's just biased nonsense. There are good and bad constituency MPs in all parties.
SHE is a MA‚ÄôAM. and yes very
I mean, two times zero is zero and that can be a guarantee :D
Yeah, I agree. It left a bad taste in my mouth that they weren't even gonna mention it, so at least it's something.
Well he was horrible the first few months. Now he's playing better. Not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this post
The real NZ L&p is lungies & puha!
What episode is this?
Well let‚Äôs research it. Apocalypse started 2003. [NAME] was 8 then. [NAME] is 11 in S2, so around 2005-2006.
Glad that you have the courage to make the call.
Yep. I‚Äôm an introvert with a big group of friends. I get tired even after spending just an hour with friends sometimes.
[NAME] also played terrible. It‚Äôs only the past couple of games has it started to click.
No, they don‚Äôt. No morning after pills/contraception pills are free, even at the clinics
Nicely done sir
He was young and he thought he was doing the right thing. No need to be rude about it.
Mine starts sweating and wondering why it‚Äôs so hot if the ac is on! ü§£üòÇ
[NAME] I hate this man
Play Origins.
remind me of this kid. Young people just being innocent on the internet
Easy answer - nobody knows. And knowing my country we will probably leave it to the last possible moment and then have an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment.
I like these cultures and would be happy to tell you what sort of work qualifications/licensure/certification have you acquired, if any?
This is still an inappropriate photo, no matter what type of dog it is
Bears Beets Baseball
Which company? Tell us, they can't do shit.
Most likely shock that had him so comatose.
I just popped a pill in my chAmpagne, she say she love me she don't even know my reAl name' -[NAME]
I'm pretty sure [NAME] was just joking. Not really sad cringe.
I swear if it's the Cowboys and the Patriots in the Super Bowl I'm going to burn something down.
Great questions. I don't have the answer, but I'm happy that were starting to discuss it.
So does [NAME] :(
Same, I still need to sleep to go to work tomorrow.
Why should I care what he thinks?
Hahaha, good point
I haven't gone by the name [NAME] since, oh before you were born.
>Playing competitive MTG has brought me as much joy as my children. Yeah this conversation is over
I agree. More stupid ideas by ''the adults in the room''.
Thats a good way to lose any good will free agents might have about coming here. Promise them something in a deal and then immediately reverse course.
I think: Congrats! That baby will now have loving parents
cool buzz words
" ""What do Scottish people look like?"" How I would love to have been there to take a swing at that softball. "
Hey Man! Your house is on fire! All you gotta do is look just turn around and look!
It's amazing how polar opposite [NAME] is from Thibs
As The Pot Bro's always say. When the Cops ask you questions. Shut the fuck up.
Well then take my upvote my sub soulmate. lol
We‚Äôd still have competing conceptions of the cool, so nothing would be solved.
Lol I'm literally an anarchist but okay
Can confirm. I've been trying to get out of bed for an hour and 15 minutes
I cant wait until /r/fuckthealtright is labeled as a Neo-Nazi group. That'd just tickle my pickle.
At least you can skip it
Lol, wut
[NAME]. I didn't think weapon durability would be a problem for me in BotW but I kind of grew an emotional attachment to that 2h battle axe...
Look up the paradox of tolerance and stop crying. Crytpo does not need a hack like JP, no matter what all the incels in the world think.
Same...except that I'm not good looking :
Boooo Hisss :)
Notice how much harder [NAME] was concentrating on catching those rocks than [NAME] did at the end of TLJ...
If you‚Äôre going to be a psycho you might as well smile and make it look like you‚Äôre a happy one.

Range should be maxed
Then he should have had his head up. This is hockey, not figure skating. Great hit! I miss that kind of contact in the game.
Good luck. Netflix restricts known VPN IP ranges. Your best bet is a buddy with Open VPN server stateside and open vpn client app on your device.
He will but the Chiefs will absolutely have a shot because the Pats defense is egregious on the road. I mean they let [NAME] go off lol.
[NAME], I‚Äôve slaughtered [NAME] today, but the man has balls, I‚Äôll give him that
Happy Birthday I hope this means anything, the little things matter sometimes.
Slacks casting, oh no here we go... I'm ready for the memes.
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE.
So police were banned from having holidays, not police banned everyone else from having holidays
Hiya! üòÉ
[NAME] the people must be warned.
I usually just refer to it as concealed carry. Cuts down on some of the tla overload
I didn't know they made phone calls ...
oh yeah? Mines real
Praying to [NAME] üòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm going to use that!
Oh no my jimmies are so rustled! Please desist your relentless banter!
üòª that's a line if I ever saw one
Most people who call themselves anarchists are against the free market because they don't understand it.
Yup, cats can you think it could get the correct call. The US and holy shit how do you know there are too brittle.
Is that why you stayed so long? :P
"""almost"" and ""nagging"" not ""killed"" and ""forced"". Wow... When did roleplayers get so damn whinny. "
Stop attacking me
I want the man who makes me pizza from scratch and then lovingly hand feeds it to me. Completely realistic expectation.
You sound upset.
Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. 
It's amazingly fun even after all these years. Aged terribly graphics-wise though.
really hope that is the case. Gotta keep the optimism up
I'm already tall, I just need to stop being a lanky scarecrow... at least I got good hips
Moreover, [NAME] is literally the only female character I've heard him criticize. Smh.
I like this title, fun to picture a violent lake stealing dogs! :)
> Or is this another attempt to get remainers on-side without actually committing to anything? Pretty much
I‚Äôm not sure you watched it.
Kinda what I figured. Just wanted to see if anyone else had this issue before
if its not obvious everyone is having issues with this scam site
A sharp stick? I think you need a rifle to kill that bastard
Tiki Lounge always smells like sewage. I'm surprise it's lasted this long.
lol robot car
What if the million dollar idea was to make free websites? That'd be bug!
Now [NAME] is the popular one!!
He was such a pet!! Beautiful looking dog
Why him* Having a healthy sex drive isn't a problem.
I feel cheated! Lol
This was such a pleasure to watch. I wish more episodes were like Brianne.
I think he acted that part pretty well
>If you can‚Äôt recognize bad acting like [NAME] emotional scenes, Oh please. Why are you even on this sub? Lol
How can someone be so stupid, hope it hurt maybe learn not to do that again.
I know. And it's very selfish of me to say, but I just wish it was different people that cared.
I refuse to watch this. Lifetime exploiting [NAME] gross behavior to sell 'entertainment'.
Thanks for looking out. Trying to keep expectations low but already have date two planned! Fingers crossed.
WOW THATS SO INTERESTING It happens to me so often that when I hear a new word I anticipate it but it all makes sense now
Happy cake day to him
Not interested. Old, slow, not a scheme fit.
No I didn't take it that way. My apologies if my comment appeared to be taking a shot at you.
Yeah, as I'm being resuscitated in A&E, I'll remember to let them know about my workers comp. #america
Faceee, you see all those models, be it plus sized, underweight or fit, all have one thing in common , good facial features
We do have Uber. I use it the odd time. The main difference is that here it's taxis only due to regulations.
Do you think CPS would help your niece get help?
Whoever made this is making Tokyo ghoul look bad
lol what? The worst defense in the league? [NAME] its like we're trying to tank.
And the dude dropped his phone between those slots... ouch!
Just keep on digging.
I am confused. I don't understand how that relates to what I said. Could you explain? Sorry, maybe I'm just tired lol
It's kind of the point. Her power creep has been one of the defining points of her character arc.
I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
Due time to me is a couple of years. Have plenty of time though
Not an ulcer (canker sore), like literally a tastebud

You might be experiencing a ttd bug?
They probably did it because of the tourneys ESL will be doing in Eu. Those tourneys will be majority EU invites
Thanks! Do you think a skeleton fort shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for a 3 man crew of average players?
When [NAME] shoots FTs you can really see the belly of that guy in the front row. It's awesome
I‚Äôve read your comment over and over and I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt parse what you‚Äôre saying.
Lol, pretty sad that even in your fake revenge fantasies you come across as a huge asshole.
My heart is breaking for you OP... good luck on your job search though!!
Out of curiosity, what will he be working on and how is it different from your role?
Clever, original, and a little knotty. Nice work.
oh my good
He looks like he is half Italian half Russian and belongs in a fight club.
Yeah the non guarenteed packs are really the worst. I think I did 2/20 on those.
r/redditminusmods its the first post there.
"Wallah Lmao It's ""voila"""

As a fan of Cinder, I really want to see [NAME] do more. I like this answer to the prompt, feels oddly nice. 
I love those possum dives!
Thanks for the P.S
Big game tonight
They definitely didn't do [NAME] mode justice with Carrier Assault. Lots of small differences that added up to feel completely at odds with the original.
Me too, except there‚Äôs no hookup. (I‚Äôm so lonely) 
The people you know have silly opinions. Its their best album since black holes.
Or better yet, live through it and then have nightmares and paranoia the rest of your life
Great job thanks!

As a teacher, I agree. Adding 'under [NAME]' just makes it feel all the more forced and disingenuous.
I am so mad I haven‚Äôt thought of doing this. Just brilliant
He's only making like 3M more than [NAME] this year wow
You don't have to act angry about things that annoy you, though. 
yea he had 6 assists which created 13 points, if he had 13 points and no assists people would be calling it a great game for him
[NAME] learning how to finish inside. I love it
Good article there! Thanks for sharing.
Lol my comment started all this again
And in those dominion game, everyone clapped. And [NAME] was there.
My mom works for Nasa and apparently no. They gave them pamphlets with numbers for credit agencies and tips on getting loans lol. Its kinda awful.
Okay, diet is important that's true. Do you take any medication? Do you have a psychiatrist or doctor who you see for your mental health?
Can't clear anyone of something that never happen or that they never did.
What film is that from, looks familiar. 
they are always playing the victim no matter what happens. bash the fash.
is the entire cast at least on there and not cut off at the bottom like the other pic I saw here?
Apparently we are tragedies!
They've done that with quite a few presidents before after all.
Yeah it isn't the same singer. 'Don't hug me I'm scared' is voiced by [NAME], the lead singer of KKB is [NAME]
ahh sweet man seems like i have more luck at night like 6 and after
That's what worries me the most - the exposed glans. Is there anything you can recommend so I can prepare myself for underwear etc?

"Read it again. He ""really likes"" her. He never claimed to love her."
Talks of contributing proportionately, wants progressive taxes. Talks of reasonable wants and needs because that‚Äôs a slippery term. 
Shouldn't be getting downvoted that's exactly what I thought the motive was
Fucking Instagram normies
The last hour is great, but I would definitely say to at least leave 15 minutes before close so you can avoid the crowds in the street.
It‚Äôs more like a large youtuber trying to sue a smaller youtuber because both of their names have a C in it.
Happy New Year! Let's smash 2019!
Oof thank you
I want [NAME] to bite me
Unfortunately the rhythmic nature of his play makes him very predictable at high levels. The best Maxi players are rather unmusical, to use the analogy
Look at this fancy guy being able to afford eggs.
Really? In real life, she's wearing comfortable clothes with no makeup. Other than that she looks the same.
So cool! So bonkers that people do this, I love it! Do you mind if I post these on my pages?
so what are we now? 4-1 in our last 5?
A person can make mistakes. Doesn't make her a bad lawyer. Her career history speaks for itself.
Which means his lifestyle is unsustainable. Look at the house and the cars. Even renting he‚Äôs just racking up debt pretending to be a millionaire.
Congrats! How are you feeling about it?
Wow, your ex partner sounds exactly like mine.
My guess? Porn. PIED.
"Seriously, I spit up my drink reading ""The GOP not the ones threatening children"". I know a few thousand kids in cages that might disagree. "

Hey buddy, wear did you ear like van-go.
you almost blew my fucking mind there.
I‚Äôm fine with leaving him alone, if he just goes ahead and leaves us all alone first.
The only thing I remember about that guy was the super racist remarks he made about [NAME].
Not really, in my mind it was continuous cringe that I was always curious about
I meant more likely than her killing them and running away.
Wow, foot and car traffic downtown has changed a ton in just 8 years. 
Wow. This would suck

You must have a different definition of exciting. Ivan v Alyosha aka atheism vs [RELIGION] is very exciting.
They were barely given a chance
In my experience its always [NAME]' Mine
Okay, this helps clarifies things more for me. Thank you!
[NAME] is actually [NAME] real name.
weirdly enough drug addicts are still human beings, shocking I know 
Now it's 7
Dude, I think you've just proven my point. 
I‚Äôve actually been there lol
I believe furloughed feds still have health insurance benefits so you're not wrong on that PSA.
So what did she mean to say? I‚Äôm so confused...
Lyft and Uber are expensive compared to Metro
What a wonderful story! Thank you so much for sharing that just made me smile .
OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.
>!This really crushed my soul!<
I don't even have a desktop PC, so I don't think being able to play on a computer will really be possible
just read to chapter 216 and im heartbroken i hope they fix this...
Right? No one brattier than incels.
Without the stupid caption this is kinda funny
Never heard of the artist or the song. But it sounds really great! Thank you for sharing!
Thank you for telling me !
I grew up in a Cornish village. Not much murder to be honest but plenty of drugs and pub lock-ins.
Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox
Hey fellow research parker, I'm at Myriad in the lower right.
Don't be afraid to put yourself out
And to think, some people would sell their soul for this level of affection 
I went out to my vehicle when changing tables were not available.
You could try addressing the post you're replying to.
this is a fun and cute presentation etc WAAAAAAAH
what‚Äôd he say?
Men are the worst.
i think people are just getting more and more fed up with playing against him
What a charming puddle of smegma.
It definitely took a lot of research to figure everything out for myself, but I‚Äôm glad I was able to help ya!
Oh boy do I have some bad news for you!
That has literally never happened.
There‚Äôs really no rationalizing their train of thought.
Just happened to me lol
Oh jeez I missed that :(
I basically had no negative side effects. I did switch to IUD because I hated remembering to take a pill everyday. But no issues.
Don't forget the fort camper.
Oh absolutely. No way he should run in 2020. I don't know what alternatives there are though.
Please, you deserve life, you know it deep down inside 
Damn. Didn't know [NAME] was still making videos.
Not surprised...he has ZERO interest in finding a job and living like a responsible adult...
Careful, he's a hero
You could easily avoid him. What a crazy concept
Go get another phone!
as a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad...
This. It seems he's undoubtedly [NAME] preferred option.
I meant to say provincial ban on smoking in it not law yet?
Thanks! Will give them a call!
TL:DR leave. Deal with the consequences later.
I love this so much, glad [NAME] made it to San Jose after all
Democrats never had complete control, that is a common misconception/lie.
I heard a version of this where the president was also a woman!
At least you're laughing. It's a step in the right direction. Have a great Friday Me. Flower-of-Power! ;-)
Get Ready!
It's more of a personal issue with me. But I completley understand and respect your decisions and way of thinking
I was in Amsterdam two weeks ago and 400 sq ft apartments were renting for 1800 euros a month in the city. They have density but no affordability.
Man I'm sad, he was my favorite [NAME] when he left ([NAME] heir apparent) and I was ecstatic when he returned
iRemindme 7 days
Now we play the waiting game.
Mmmmmm üòê ü§î yeah
Im sure you‚Äôll love it
Your gender doesn't really affect my opinion. Guys on dating apps might be patient for 5 dates but they aren't waiting for marriage
Thank you! [NAME] is a character that means a lot to me, and it makes me happy that you like my portrayal of her.
I keep seeing this argument and I will tell you my wait times are long also - I don't have the DLC.
Pecan pie to 0 cals. I love it and I can't ever eat it and I want it so bad!
You win one internet!
I‚Äôd want him to keep whatever gimmick this is it looks interesting
Im really sad, and there is alot more goin on but i dont know how to tell it.
There are quite a few hideous high rises in dallas. But also some beautiful and iconic ones.
Technically, if [NAME] are right about him, then you already did nail him... soooooo...
Tickets to a 2008 Preliminary Final, paper print out version too, incredibly random.
What is everybody obsession with trading away young players in this sub?
If they're not spending this year on [NAME] or [NAME], I have no faith for them to spend on big free agents in the near future
[NAME] is so damn good
No. That‚Äôs an actually pot plant. You have to do some extra work to keep it blooming each year.
Nobody should keep any around that is this ass-cracked to oblivion.
Any chance you have a bank account information you want to share?
Lol it's only been 7 years. Don't let your guard down now.
The lips imo
I was going to say Tigres but then I reread the title and it said ‚Äòbig‚Äô
I'm more annoyed at the Labour MPs that didn't vote for it - I expect more from them
You okay?
Great! I love hotsssssssssssss
Those hurt people who are genuinely harmed and need to be made whole through litigation.
when has one of those systems succeeded?
I love him!
I feel like you've answered your own question.
I‚Äôm so sorry that you both have to deal with this ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my [NAME] I saw the rocks below the dog and feared the worst!
> How TF did you get to FETISH that quickly? Welcome to the internet. Enjoy your stay.
I think they were hoping he would be the [NAME], that didn't happen.
Wow, I didn't know that was happening. Thanks for the information!
Happy cake day! :)
The mods deleted it I'm sorry
I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic, I was just asking if you are morbidly obese. 
We need [NAME] to review this...
Damn, I hope that lady unloaded the rest of the bread and cleared out like a fart in the wind before homeslice came back.
The ‚Äútargets‚Äù so far has been guilty.
My dream place is Canada, my bi online friend moved there recently
You mean by number of military personnel? Because if you go by navy size or budget that's not even remotely true
Neither of them have the IQ for true narcissism!! Stop insulting the intelligence of narcissists [NAME]!
it will be the compilation of 3 games, don't get your expectations that high.
Surely, you can't be serious!
You'll like this then:
This is repulsive what the fuck is wrong with places like this. It does have an element of hilarity tho
If the hot end starts pointing towards space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today.
You‚Äôre argument is so bad you‚Äôre now asking people to deny common sense because you can‚Äôt prove your point LOL super pathetic
It's not an conscious choice to be uncomfortable about something.
It did. MM used way more textures than Ocarina.
I've seen that profile picture before..this guy is a repeat offender
Unfortunately many of the people that say they understand and endorse that statement, and the ideals behind it, do neither.
"Yes, absolutely. ""But woe to the one who betrays me. It would have been better for that man, if he had never been born."""
Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?! 
[NAME] would have the biggest fit if he gets benched for [NAME]. He's unfortunately become to slow to keep up with guys like [NAME].
Just spitballing here, but im pretty sure he likes basketball. Really weird, i know.
And no rails because we have a reasonably logic scense. And we cant sue nobody for our own dumb mistakes.
I told her that same thing. She insisted that it was a possession
I did the Karl's Corner VIP package and it was great. There was a mini Weezer museum and I met [NAME]! And saw [NAME] from afar.
Their hands must've been sweaty.
Oh! Im also Chinese (Singaporean) and due to the laws here my boyfriend and i are looking to go elsewhere...
Bravo! It's hard saying you need help, and sometimes even harder accepting it. So proud of you momma!
Thanks for the summary. I was having a hard time keeping up! :)
Wow this was an eye-opening response, and you‚Äôre right it helped us learn more, be compassionate and focus on a better well-being.
Us girls are taught to always be polite. Screw that, safety is more important.
Maybe you‚Äôre just extremely boring and bland, and outright refuse to learn to take photos that don‚Äôt suck. 
[NAME] love for you
You must have watched a lot of two girls and one cup.
This game looks way too fast for the Oilers rn
a celebrity i like had his appendix out and tweeted about how surgery left him with an ugly belly button ü§£
I love this game already
There where over 40000 stabbings in the UK last year, and this guy reckons these ‚Äúkids‚Äù are just acting tough üò¨
Thank you for mentioning that!
It's just an inside job to wreck his stats so we can lower the AAV on his 8-year contract extension after he wins back-to-back Vezinas
You are one pathetic human being.
Aloha!!
It's just projection..they can't take a joke so they think no one else can either.
He seems sweet and I think he really loves her.
[NAME] and [NAME]? High five on the cheers tho
I loved [NAME]. He didn't seem evil at all!
Congrats for coming out üòÅüòÅ
She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality.
tbh if I had to listen to [NAME] voice in person I would probably punch myself in the eardrums a la Asuelu
why is this hard to believe it‚Äôs totally believable
7am. I‚Äôll be done at 3pm. I‚Äôd love that
I think I could watch an entire show with just these two all the time.
that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
Looks like *[NAME]* was there with her murderous [NAME].
This guy footballs
[NAME] explains why she was so close to her grandmother.
Prove it.

I would be interested in some of this stuff. Would love to see if posted here

No worries. Just giving you a hard time!

did anyone calculate aprox. how much would the food cost in total?
Thanks! I'm glad you got a kick out of it.
Thank you for educating me. Lol
[NAME] is showing unusual restraint at the sight of a defenseless woman.
sorry should clarify ... have dinner / drinks and then go our separate ways to other events that night.
It‚Äôs definitely around in Eastern Nebraska. You can even get it at Runza.
i wouldn't take that significant of a pay cut. you should keep your job and do your creative writing on the side/free time.
True Story! That's the sad Part of it...
Maybe the dog wasn't on a leash the last time...
FYI not all skinheads are racists. [NAME] suck and should be confronted.

This was great!! Thanks

Ah. I should've noticed that after my grandma shared it on FaceBook
the last minute of game time lasted 15 minutes.
Sure? Money is still being used by them instead of the government wastefully taking it
thanks i hate her
Yay I feel so uplifted!!!
[NAME] has never said he wanted to build the team around [NAME]. Not sure why people are spreading this rumour.
Someone is jealous they‚Äôre not in a union.
[NAME] has 2 fouls and they don't force [NAME] on him in paint?
Wow I‚Äôm sorry. Can you take pictures of your bruises? What was she nagging you about?
Wow does that really work? I've never heard of anyone doing that before.
I need a do over!!!! At least I‚Äôm not the only one lol, solidarity ‚úåÔ∏è

This question belongs in askreddit or the like. They can deal with the sexist crap this is going to dredge up.
"I read it as ""urinary breast implant"" and was quite confused I must say. "
This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.
I didn't say [NAME] was on the left. I asked how he isnt on the left, because I dont know. Thanks for your help.

I made friend with one of these scammers. After speaking to me he quit his job at that company. We still speak regularly over whatapp and facetime!
I hope everyone has a nice day.
Have you heard of the [NAME].
Wow, that‚Äôs fascinating! I‚Äôd be interested to know the rationale (or lack thereof) for a [NAME]. 
Some guy that I went to hs with 7 yrs ago but haven't seen him since.
If [NAME] gave me pizza I'd still be annoyed but I'd eat it.
He used to be a science teacher!
It's not about not understanding it's that you're wrong. It's sexual assault. Rape = person being penetrated. You've been shown multiple definitions.

You wouldn't like him when he's angry....

Thank you! I was wondering what to do tomorrow morning. Now I have something to go to.
Ironic that that‚Äôs a false claim... BUT mao did directly cause the lives of 100million of his own people
So many freakin' softies dude.
To be fair, it is worse than staying in the EU, but good grief it's better than a no deal.

Ripped but not bulky is anything but unremarkable. So, attractive, talented, and rich. I can't imagine what women see in guys like that.
I don't know
Thank you for answering. It's much appreciated.
There's the room for [NAME].
OMG. This is such a great point!
I know I should be worried, but I am not, which makes me very worried. 
This makes me wanna die
[NAME] is available
Are you saying that's why they went with [NAME]? That's racist
Divine ruler [NAME]
Maybe this will convince them we need mass transit! Haha.
What bothers me is not the fact that someone disagrees with my lifestyle, it's that they constantly go on and on about..that would annoy anyone.
This is awesome. What are your profits like?
This is a reliable estimate. It could happen as early as in the 2020‚Äôs if were unlucky
Thats what I thought, he can be very lucky to walk away from that 
Sorry to disappoint, we are working very hard as employees to turn this thing around. Hopefully we can change your mind in the future.

I love it when people assume things.
I thought it was still in theaters.
It's 3 Calling Cards I believe, and one sticker for getting Flawless. Other than that, no (unless you wanna count bragging rights).
first time all season im kind of not thrilled with [NAME] post game talk. I wish he would have addressed the PP.
"Going through a divorce right now. Her saying ""I love you and maybe we should go to counseling"" would make me more than happy."

Thanks, I hate reposts
I'm impressed that you have little knowledge of the game, would you unsubscribe?
What about Dallas and Austin?
This is not unique to [RELIGION]. There are various sects and denominations in every world religion.
I was thinking maybe she just wants attention and for people to say she‚Äôs not ugly.
i am shocked... SHOCKED I TELL YOU!

No, we should increase border security because we have an absurd number of people crossing illegally.
Wow that's a burden, I'm sorry.
Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.
This guy died on the inside lol
[NAME] has played really well though. Arguably better than [NAME]
this is the bro-est thing ive seen all week
shhh patience, a future video
Do you want to be promoted to Secreatary of State for the US?
Whoops, I'm* dying. But I wish, they make so much money. 
Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
Happy day! Five years from now you will be a top ten player in the NHL.
[NAME] damn it
Lol the outbreak is gone but I'm still stubborn. With this conversation I'll make my effort to come back as soon as I'm ready.
Happy New Year you wonderful mummy you! I was thinking about you today and hoping you were doing okay ‚ò∫
We won't. If Ireland do they'll be violating the GFA.
In winter, it's SO difficult for me to cope when I had been thinking of getting one but don‚Äôt know what they are doing.
Trust me, you can anthropomorphize anything and fuck it. Or at least, that‚Äôs what the internet has taught me.
Wait. That‚Äôs illegal.
You tried your best, and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.
Obviously there is a unicorn conspiracy perpetuated by [NAME], who are trying to suppress the truth about one-horned animals 
yeah, a little bit.
> we should ally with them in organization for change lol good luck with that
She‚Äôs my girl crush
Your mom is being ridiculous. It's not a bid deal, she's taking out frustration with something else on you, maybe. 
[NAME] was pretty good too. Cuah was the best 10 tho
Potentially, he was built up as having all these questions and being part of [NAME] Legion. But they never went anywhere with it.
You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only

The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on
I forgot context and thought you meant the band was republican, please don‚Äôt worry me like this again 
Style of play is overrated. We spent half of the season sticking to a style of play. We should play what gives wins.
I don't generally find the CBO projections very accurate in retrospect. Some of their accounting practices and metrics seem error prone.
Thanks for sharing, it really sucks that people would do this. I barely slept last night because I was so frustrated with the situation.
I don't remember, it was all very hazy...
i suppose it did, but the kick follow up whiff is what i was really pointing out
She was funny with [NAME] in the previous BFQOE I think. I honestly think she needed a better partner in this episode
Yeah, the only issue with the scene is how long the dance scene goes. 
Thank you! Forgot to add her youtube. And her second, smaller, channels (super entertaining rants): 
My favourite part is that the Saints are completely right, but it doesn't matter a god damn bit.
As much as I hate [NAME] I love the guy a lot
Happy Together. It feels so natural.
It‚Äôs endless the amount of white papers written in the last 3/4 years. Not one has been any good or any use
I just want someone who listens to scientists. That's too much to ask though.
Don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of that..but hey thanks, hero!
Loving it too, has made me forget about BO4 & Destiny 2...so addicting! 
I liked [NAME] updated ‚ÄúI thought this was a teaching hospital!‚Äù
Good god what if they‚Äôre all ru songs
Hey mister!
What is this trash?
watch us play better without him
You have nothing to feel bad about. It sounds like he needs to grow up and start paying his way.
The weapon wasn‚Äôt made until 1918-1919 so hopefully this will never be real
[NAME] damn you're dedicated.
This would be huge!
He said some facts and you accused him for being 50c. From his tone you can't even tell he's a supporter of CPC.
Haha, no I mean the kind of disposable powerups in a mobile game. Not console/PC games.
He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn‚Äôt have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.
It means that [NAME] campaign colluded, contrary to them saying otherwise. Sorry if you voted to advance Russian interests.
I think they were just doing their job. Reporting what they saw. And yea that was the happiest I have seen [NAME]. Weird.
Ah. I would just send the money back. 50 euros is a lot for a kid to just give away...
Yes. Half the posts on this sub are about posing. I think the pose she is pulling is ridiculous too...
I'm going with 720. She is like [NAME]!
Yeah, I think we're on the same page. Maybe a different sentence, but the same page.
[NAME] looks miserable in those photos.

You'd look like that too if you just saw Snagglepuss going to the bathroom.
Didn't Canada have more guns per capita then USA? I think I saw that in Bowling for Columbine. But [NAME] seem pretty chill about it.
I wonder what was stopping that barber using the lightning network for payments?
Everyone just called me the bad guy and said they're glad she's marrying him and rejected me and that i deserved it.
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. 
I question that he doesnt think they are a possible answer, we have interviewed guys with much more questionable credentials
Yes. Views are a real thing that matters. The very fact that a person makes an effort to appeal to voters is not.
Obligatory fuck the dodgers
Gr√∏h. Fast great moves and becomes insane during soul charge
Drives me crazy.
My [NAME]! This isnt a vaccine! It's a jello shot!
[NAME]: I'm sorry that happened. I hope you weren't totally friendless on your 30th!

I guess. Thanks.
Come on how would gladiators let [NAME] go.
The stories where he meets and talks shit to [NAME] are some of the best!
It was skeletor!!! Beast man was dunk
Poor Target didn‚Äôt make enough millions during one of the most hectic Christmas seasons I recall in almost 2 decades. Gotta save that payroll though.
I'm guessing this talk will be gated behind the expo pass at GDC. Do these become (legitimately) publicly available after the event?
Its not the 90s old man. Now if you said you like pancake asses, thats juicy
*talks about [NAME]* oh also the canucks have never really drafted and developed a star goaltender
Oh your boyfriend [NAME] is heavy also. Must be a sturdy bed
I wish could do what you do. It has been my dream. Im jealous

Honestly right now I just need to know why our usernames are so similar. Haha...
Yeah it was, it was awful, everyone got sick, I was sick for like a week after that event.
[NAME] a filthy commie statist who wants to take your guns, has no idea how economics works, and has the morals of a left-wing welfare degenerate. 
My guess is they work with older folks
Just hit my 3pl8 squat, been looking forward to this for a long time so really happy I finally got it! Now on to 4
Nothing wrong with pasta or bread. Stop buying bleached flour products and get whole grain.
i am aware...
Used to be the same with [NAME]
You obviously have never seen those creepy videos with 10m+ views with kids. And those Elsagate videos.
Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.

Honestly scared to see what happens
Because I've heard Him speak to me and comfort me.
The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.
Read this while pooping. Laughed WAY too hard! Thank you for that.
It's like [NAME] said. They get motivated by a bad loss, they win a game, get unmotivated, and lose badly again
Lol nicely done
Of course that's possible but you need to provide some proof.
"""Ummmmm *Eeyore*? Duh?"" *sighs violently, rubs temples* (This is when I leave before I do/say something stupid)"
I've been getting it off from the West Wing since I discovered it after the election.
Maybe they think they‚Äôre attractive. Some people are oblivious until proven otherwise.
The highest rate of eating disorder in men is binge eating disorder... I fail to see how a pressure to l ok good causes binge eating disorder
Alice In Chains and Metallica are still releasing quality music!
But that's classified under the DSM-5 as a mental disorder.
There is a special place in hell for drivers like you. I pray to [NAME] there is.

Yet I still feel lonely doing it...
How did that tree not grow?!
They took my favorite hair gel!! The bastards! Good thing I took a picture of it beforehand just in case
Not [NAME]! He had 0.9% kick to selfs so he'll probably keep bunging them in from the goal square and not getting any stats.
Thank you. Yeah this makes sense too. I could be blaming myself more than I should
Mavs fans are mavs fans, who cares what they are later. Stop gatekeeping
Us as well, along with home
apparently since you won't do it
I mean it sucks but that man looks deaded
Beautiful and thank you for the inspiration.
I'll kill you.
I‚Äôve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
Gives me physical pain thanks
Give him the stick. Don't give him the stick!
It's not because you killed the chicken. Kill another one and see if that happens again.
Care to elaborate?
I went into business with two friends and none of us speak anymore. Eventually money changes everyone for better or for worse.
I‚Äôve never been in love, haha. So I wouldn‚Äôt know.. thank you for this comment :)
The Wall was calling... from inside the house!!
I gotta say, that was a WELL fought period. I was worried a couple times...
Most FBI agents never fire their weapons and spend more time looking at excel sheets, lol
I wondered the same thing. I never knew that this is a thing.
maybe dont do any drugs lol
Girlfriend is straight off of Shop Hush social app and onto reddit. Someone tell her, its slightly embarrassing.
I can't imagine getting it at 8! I got mine at 11 and freaked out because no one told me they existed lol.
I sleep alone on the floor. That was a bad idea...
That last bit is part of the embarrassment, actually.
It's an... Interesting place. You seen that boy shoofta that posts on it? He ain't right.
That‚Äôs fair.
Doubtful that's why he did it. Which in turn leads to even more disturbing reasons possible. SOS
Fucking and being a boy
Why is [NAME] so memeable.
Damn some of these are so cringy that i almost downvote them, but realize that they are suppose to be terrible.
This is why I asked. [NAME] people.
What‚Äôs populism? I‚Äôve seen it a lot lately and it seems to have, as far as I can tell...no meaning.
What‚Äôs the motive for doing this? To save on fuel by transporting as many people as possible in one go?
Based on that cars wheels it is now very tired.
This is the shitposting I love
I can't tell if this is satire of not. It's got this whole [NAME] and [NAME] dad rock vibe going on.
Oh no! No, there was nothing wrong in your comment. I appreciate you taking the time! 
Do hope you're going to let that poor, traumatised boyfriend know. Sounds like he's had more than enough abuse already
I dont want to live in this world no more
They have great chemistry and it‚Äôs a cool dynamic but it can‚Äôt take over the entire show
I remember [NAME] mentioning [NAME] and that was it. I do remember all the [NAME] hype.
I‚Äôve been banned twice there so I unsubscribed and joined this sub. This sub IS SO MUCH BETTER!
It's all been downhill since the [NAME] arrived. #NormansGoHome.
She shows her face and doesn't hide behind fake names on Reddit .

OH DARN IT, THANKS FOR THE REMINDER MFER!!!
I am so sorry those kind of people make me sick
Lol what boyfriend
I would make a terrible partner. Fuck, I'm not even a good friend. 
I fucking hate [NAME]
I appreciate it, that's good to know. I hope I'll have to apply that knowledge one day

What happened ?!
This is great, thank you! I‚Äôll take a read and see what is still available.
I‚Äôm saving this.
That guy had the day off when HI came in.

Always!! I especially love when they ask for the *exact thing that‚Äôs in their lunch* but, like, a new one. 
Agreed haha.
Dude I love working OC. You can bounce around like 4 different districts
Had a quick listen and it could potentially be my jam! Thank you, kind [NAME] :)
Can we get a moment of silence for the passing of the video game boy?

I'm impressed you found a non troll post of theirs.

Man they must really hate [NAME] out of position at SF. But let‚Äôs play [NAME] at SF that should work.
You love your joke!
Ah, well thank you. On an unrelated note, does ‚ÄúBenchys‚Äù mean boobs?
I love you, 125.
I don't judge anyone with this stuff trust me I can hold it close to my face so I could make tea!
You must not have any critical thinking skills what so ever.
Omg stop spamming.
So, so good
You forgot about cats. They‚Äôre all talking about their cats.
Thanks for further justifying my support for Tulsi, Daily Gross.

Can't wait
Thank you! I was thinking, man, I‚Äôve never been corrected about this before. üòê
I‚Äôve literally done this when drunk before, I doubt it was you but my apologies nonetheless haha 
I second this sentiment! This has bothered me since the beginning and I don‚Äôt know if she really grasps how incredibly offensive this is!
I never knew it lost any so this is kinda news to me
Can we just go down there and propose a bill? Die the constitution not allow that? An if were not allowed doesnt that count as non representation?

That the [NAME] is [NAME] actual father?
I applaud you (in a non-sarcastic way)
That's really sad and shocking to hear this Really embarrassed to be a human being on this earth...
The Guardian are covering it. Naturally they think we're far-right activists and misogynists whose displeasure proves the necessity of the [NAME] campaign...

This truly is the best a man can get.
I ain‚Äôt your pal buddy.
This one really made me laugh.. Omg

Congrats I‚Äôm very happy for your happy ending. Wish you guys many many years of happiness together

[NAME] is always late to meetings
This is the only viable way out of Brexit.
Yeah its confusing why this gets me out of sorts so much
Very true. Apologies if it came off that way.

That was the last straw! So no~
Just turned on the game. I hope I brought the boys some good luck
Thank you, I‚Äôll send them to her the next time we talk

This poor soul is pointing a gun to his head and smiling.
That's how I apologize to carists, too
^ This. You know the guy's a liability when multiple teams openly admit to taking advantage of his defensive inconsistency at the left.
>image management issue Seriously?! I must have missed that.
Imagine having to pretend you didn't edit your link. The inferiority is dripping off you.
I sincerely hope they'll take good elements from DMC 2 (outfits, [NAME]) and maybe make fun of DmC
You just made me so happy.
You can just watch the video. It's pretty instructive.
What a horseshit response
Can [NAME] just shut up and appreciate her dog?
I now live in the Mediterranean, which is nice. 
Yes I heard abt the f bombs! That has to be why. Thanks for your reply:) until then hubby and I will anxiously wait üòù
"No it doesn't. It's a lie. [NAME] is not far right. The US hasn't ""installed"" anyone"

[NAME] is another worthless [NAME]. Utah is unbelievably stupid for voting for him.
Looks great but am I the only one who can't hear anything?
No scratch. Weird. It's almost like she just popped her pimples and smeared the blood. ü§î
Wow wish I could take that. That is an absolute steal. Not a lock by any means but value alone is worth it
Time to be successful elsewhere.
The last thing that soldier wants is to get with her battle buddies.
Get his master class. My boyfriend watched it and he got obsessed with cooking, knife techniques, etc. (for like 3 months).
[NAME] baking company is one of them.
I'm not going full vegetarian but I am trying to cut down on eating meat a bit.
Can someone summarise it here? I can‚Äôt get past the paywall.
That‚Äôs the impression I was getting as well, or maybe something [NAME] would conjure up
Just got back. They're completely sold out for today. Edit: They sold out at 11:50ish.

I was just about to comment this. She might be a wonderful human being, but I have suspicions. 
They must have seen you.
Does that include [NAME]?
"I can see the posters now... ""Come to Barnsley, it's full of people just like you"". "
I hope you meant stay strong, we are here for you. Me too.
She didn't say anything on twitter or anything im not sure how u know, but it's whatever she seems fine and it's her privacy
I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
[NAME] just one big oof today
this is my dream
Yeah like feminism! Not at all artificially inflated with terrible facts, information and school systems.
thanks for sharing.
Short answer, fuck no, don't ever fall for it. Don't make the same mistake Canada has.
Nope what‚Äôs it about?
I hate this, and I hate you. But actually I love this, and only like you.

Ya I have rain barrels out in the region and it's crazy how dry this winter has been. Totally abnormal.
Well this is the dumbest take I‚Äôve seen on here.
Does that make a meaningful difference? Which organisations is he talking about? No specifics, just a general smear of experts.
I‚Äôll keep the fruits of my labor and my firearms thanks for the cute ideas though, sounds nice til it‚Äôs you in the breadline 
Thank you; I tried.
And a reminder to me that I get to keep watching this sport and not start watching cricket.
Has he?
I'm not a [NAME]. Can someone explain this to me?
Come on, at least give me one other comment not from this thread. Show me that you are at least interested in providing an argument. 
Not to burst anyone's bubble, but this ad isn't new. Maybe it's just being recirculated because of the whole Gillette fiasco.

That's literally insane considering we're talking about [NAME] and [NAME].
I don't even wear a shirt in the day around the house. Way too hot.
Hmmm to click or not to click... well goodbye SFW

>I just wanna let you know your beautiful I don't appreciate being lied to!
Thank you! Does it contain clinical trails?
[NAME] will never do anything to help you. You must stand up for yourself.
Ahahaha I‚Äôm enjoying your troll. Seriously remember commenting on it like a year ago. Hilarious people are still trying to correct you.
i hope so
several illegal wars? You seen much combat?
Such a nice photo of city hall.
Not starting it at that temperature is a great way to drain your car of an ability to start. Pick your poison.
We were by far the better team - [NAME] had no chance on any of the goals. Bad mistakes by [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]
Exact same here. I blame the egg nog!
Maybe in the parts where nobody lives
don't you want [NAME]?
Thanks for being here. :-) We can always use allies.
Ping pong in the park and maybe a cold one with the bros
Despite what you may feel about me, I‚Äôm happy you got that off your chest, I hope you feel better!
Thats not what i said but okay schlomo
I gave him a hug and told him how glad I was that he was okay after the police assault. He‚Äôs amazing!

She is my favorite model from American Eagle store. Such beauty and so positive.
That's the kind of person who'd fuck up making you a plain hamburger. That sack o' shit needs to be sent through a wood chipper.
Might relax you a little bit but definitely don't expect some amazing buzz from just 1 15mg pill. 15mg might feel like 5-7.5mg diazepam.
Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse

Can we stop suggesting [NAME] as [NAME] it's not happening.
Welcome back [NAME]!! You sexy Brazilian SON OF A BITCH

There's a ton of reasons in other threads.
lmao! That happens to me at times, It‚Äôs like really??? I was just checking if my bullets came in the mail.
As opposed to becoming a U.S. citizen the illegal way?
But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad.
you are definitely trolling us. That can't be true
Glad we got that criminal off the streets! No-good [NAME]. Tsk tsk
That‚Äôs not true at all. I play on xbox and you can‚Äôt Loot teammates you or any squad mates kill.
Hope your mum gets well soon. Enjoy Saturday!
You look adorable. :) I love your eyes. :)
Wow, if I hadn't seen my mom's cat recently I'd think this was him! I hope you find the owners
I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
Please don't. I like the gym too be quiet
They can lock the doors all they want, unless they have the child locks turned on there's nothing stopping me from unlocking the door. 
Or a lovegod That supports you
THANK YOU!
[NAME] is the second biggest loser in TV history though, behind only [NAME]. 
Impossible to do this with any consistency, and like the other poster mentioned confronting the fare evaders often results in these dangerous situations. 
Unsub from both

You will find the words that work for your dynamic. The fact you are worried and thinking about it is 75% of the battle
He should really let [NAME] come inside him

Good things take time.
That isn't normal or healthy. Stop obliging her obsession.
Doesn't matter how late the apology! She apologised and kindness is all the world needs :)
What? That's exactly what I got from it. Obviously red-haired people are just defective and need to be cured/corrected. /sssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
So people will support him in this fake news quick reaction political environment
What a god
It bugs me just how many people move over to be on camera
I wouldn't mind [NAME] but then that means his idiot brother would come to our games so I can pass on that.
Our volume of immigration does not mean it is easy to get in. The bar is very high and there are many applicants.

Don't be, this is funny. I love it when [NAME] shows his emotions.

I love how people ITT are deploying x/2+7 like it's from [NAME], LOL.
Conformity should probably be the norm when a horde of individuals are moving 2000+lb pieces of metal around to individual destinations at 110km/h, tbh.
I remember seeing that scene the first time and being like.... I loved Princess [NAME] before, but now... something is different
As it should be. No way I'd want my kid crossing 5 lanes of traffic to get to the bus everyday.
honestly i don‚Äôt mind it but ik some people do and i rly don‚Äôt care enough to get into that
Its not... your fault
Good luck on your grad school applications! üí™
That poor janitor.
So happy for your strong stance and to help him on his way out of your life.
Yep first to go crying to the government but happy to bully single mums on the benefit
The left side attack of [NAME] [NAME] was woeful
AND THEY ARE REALLY ANNOYING WE MADE FIRST CONTACT 30 YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE STILL SENDING US TERRIBLE MINION MEMES
[NAME] dumped me...
So good to see [NAME] back, looks like he hasn't lost a step.
[NAME] still looks fresh for 40 years old.
[NAME] gonna get a looooot of assists tonight if everyone keeps shooting like this goddamn
That's not what diffusion is at all smh
This meme is dated and lost it's humor years ago. All you're doing is taunting people who have followed a different path in life.
I REALLY MISS GRIFFIN REINHART
I love the Nets
Shitpost from the uncultured
I let my cat lick the leftover milk out of the bowl after I eat cereal, he loves it. 
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I meant. My bad.
Yeah it is getting strange. I've even been talking to a right wing poster for the last few days who is terrified of her.
[NAME]... Cur from Kindred says hi. (Order). Y'all remember JTT? Best guild ever.
Saturn comes back around, SHOWS YOU EVERYTHING

Agreed, my guy.
Keep practicing until you get real confident
Happy birthday!! Lots of love and hugs from a stranger in Hanoi ü§óü§ó
The percentages Apple wants for membership have made many companies pull their apps. Seeking must feel it's not worth paying Apple.
It might be linked to the trust factor of your friend.
I am! And I have no idea! Lol sorry. I have some of my own and I couldn't even name them to you.
This is horrible. I just have one question about your title. Are you implying that hate as a concept is always a bad thing?
üòÄahhh I see what you did there, clever.
Read both. Get both sets of opinions.
Wi-fi and 4G ARE microwaves, and it IS radiation. 
Wow the garbage one and the bank one are really terrible. I‚Äôve had the coupon ones too, people are touchy about coupons haha.
Cute. üíñ
We just watched the animated episode with [NAME] - it was awesome. Quite subversive.
Nit bad for a flip phone! That a T-Mobile circa 2008?
Wow this is supee trashy. How did it get to front page?
Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. 
i think [NAME] and [NAME] used to be married then he divorced her when he found she was cheating.
[NAME] will be gone. Although I think end of the first is where he should go, he will go super early
Chi snowing. Can't get a break.... Also I'm crushing it.
INFP. I‚Äôm a very selfless person, which helped me find friends, but not a love interest or a partner
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
Srs that shade range is abysmal smh
Damn you really need a girlfriend, dude. ü§£ 
I have the same issue with a new co-worker and it drives me insane.
It makes sense, just don't expect much thanks from the rest of them.
You too. Glad to hear your respectful voice again
It was a good sub before the porn took over
Players need to have Agency over their characters. you did not. total crap. :(
That‚Äôs how I got banned

Via chat. I sent a photo to confirm that she really wanted it.
I'm sure HMB Barbers at Nundah village will look after you
Thank you.
Saw it. Loved it. Wasn't hating on [NAME] man, was just commenting on what I was watching lol. 
"I feel like Canadian Tire only exists still because ""I guess I'll go to Canadian Tire, they'll have it"""
Which is why the floor ruling was incorrect if it happened as he says.
That‚Äôs a really cool GMC van there, love seeing really old, unusual vehicles like that around town.
Wow I hope TSM keeps this new midlaner they picked up.
I have no idea what that even means nor why you're being such a massive prick
"Bro, people are telling you why a hundred bucks isn't a ""high fee"" for this type of event and you're not listening. Cheers. "
That level 20 purifier upgrade can get so juicy.... i love artanis
I met bf of 3 yrs on it
Hope not. That would be a bad decision.
They play some of if not the best characters in the game ([NAME]), yet they think every other character means you're weak. So ironic.
i really like that! I'll start using it moving forward =)
Fun fact: [NAME] had the upper hand because he had a sling shot, ye olde wordy equivalent of a gun.
As a man I would be quite pleased to hear this
No it's laziness. People don't clean because there isn't an immediate consequence and the reward for cleaning isn't large enough.
It's changing, slowly but surely. 20 years ago most people liked fur, now it's seen as cruel and unnecessary.
I have but one upvote to give, otherwise you would get more.
Bernie Sanders and a hairbrush.
Lol. Yes, the contractors know
I don‚Äôt think his clothing was so tight when he purchased it..
Thanks for a different perspective, this made me feel better.
At the very least it is an emotional affair or the beginnings of one, with less than truthful explanations.
üòÖ I wrote that to indicate tears of relief and happiness but what I was actually doing was laughing like a lunatic knowing that I wasn‚Äôt alone.
"Just to let you know, it's not he had ""multiple instances, he had so much they thought he was a distributeur for it."
are you only looking for someone to share? do you want someone else or are you just doing this so your partner might have someone?
Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror
Did that EVER work? Why did [NAME] keep going to that play over and over again when it resulted in 4th down after 4th down?
37 and together 12 years. 11 yo kiddo. Thanks for the tip. You're right.
I feel like [NAME] and [NAME] from AH should chat, especially about the [NAME] from BOTW
This is a school announcement: Remember not to commit thought crimes in the classroom. Repeated thought crimes will result in a lowering of your grades.
Not all of us young teens eat tide pods Mom would be sad
[NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
Putting them away feels so good it‚Äôs worth the frustration. Snipers dropped my career KD by like .15 >__<
[NAME]. And I‚Äôm not even trolling. I seriously love him.
I shower with the lights off. The first time felt really unnatural but now it's actually really comforting.
Stars don‚Äôt get chicks my dude. Good way to let everyone know you are a fucking goober
Best part about this is that the cowboys will re-sign [NAME] and hopefully [NAME] too
Best sports league in the world.
Why do I have a feeling tommorow there‚Äôs going to be a post. [NAME] broke up with me cause he thinks we‚Äôre related HELP!
And those kids made fun of the people doing it just as much as everyone else. Source: i am a high school teacher.
It's mooching. Tell him not to be a freeloader and get his own Netflix lol
I am usually quiet in those situations, but I will occasionally throw in a joke to get everyone laughing.
So would you want [NAME] first round, [NAME] second then this guy in the third?
They both crazy
I bet you're part of the gangs sneaking illegal, murderous drugs to other countries just to keep your family better fed than someone elses family. Fucking psychos
It's near Brooklyn. Very woodsy, couple nice little antique shops. Most definitely the middle of nowhere.
I've done this my whole life though...
The fact that LGBTQ rights were only recently (and not completely) recognized by the government directly contradicts the idea that gaining their rights has been quick.
Just as a curiosity I wonder what [NAME] would offer for someone like him in light of their desperation at forward.
[NAME] gettin angry!
And every [NAME] on Reddit has an anxiety attack...
You're giving the coyotes faaaaarrrr to much credit they cross mostly around the wall.
Wow thank you so much for this response. I wrote down everything and will try and do it all.
Can‚Äôt believe people still fall victims to those machines.
thanks for the reply jzplayinggames, have a great weekend.
Close your damn mouth before it catches a fly
Although cool, it is not a bridge, it is road through snow.
This is completely false.
It started to compute for me when I was ‚Äúright‚Äù all the time but never ended up getting what I wanted.
lool ok I laughed pretty hard at this.
As someone who has lived his entire life in the tropics, I can't even begin to imagine what those kinds of temperatures are like.

It's showtime!!
It's cool.
[NAME] a fantastic word poet
Well i know this much is true, there‚Äôs unspoken truth amoung us men, we secretly love hairy vaj. No? Just me?

Happy cake day by the way!
Thank you!
i am the new [NAME] hope she doesn't get hated on when she returns on all stars
I miss him...
Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation.
Ugh, sometimes I have both at the same time!
"Is there such thing as ""only a cat""?"
I‚Äôm gonna need a couple more checks before I trade down for a retarded kid.
Chuckle worthy. It's funny. There's at least structure to set up the punchline.
You don't have a confession then?
Take them out of his care and into the care of someone who can watch them until you are able to protect them yourself.
>Most likely lassaire stones. [NAME]. [NAME]. The bane of gemologists. Glassy garbage.
I don‚Äôt see the MAGA hat kid working to undermine civil liberty. It‚Äôs at least understandable to react violently to tyrants.
Happy to- good luck!
My best guess is that it means 155 won, 6 lost, 839 drawn.
Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)
McRibs are back on the menu but not in the Washington DC metro area.
This pic they used for [NAME] makes her look like [NAME]
We should urge him to run, put our Sorosbux to some good use.
We need our damn OL coach...he was amazing this year.
Everyone has a right to fetish. Does not mean I cannot say ‚Äúyou deserve to be nailed to a cross‚Äù for it

Ooh! I quite like the swimming pool of makeup as well.
Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.

He is like a bad cartoon that‚Äôs hard to turn off.
38 yrs. It was worth it though.
That‚Äôs something I hadn‚Äôt considered. I‚Äôll do just that. Thank you!
Going to the doctor tomorrow for a checkup to make sure everything is normal and hopefully this shit is just in my head.
Yeah, I mean we‚Äôre all just in their wake over here. I‚Äôm humbled.
This is Reddit. These idiots don‚Äôt read articles, let alone one from *The Atlantic*.
I spent hours worrying about the y2k bug. None of it mattered. I suspect q is about as relevant.
they're called queens for a reason, fuck democracy
I might be missing a joke myself, but woosh.
Those not a part of the Austinfred bashing hive mind at the other sub will find themselves here tomorrow. üôÑ.

You want to celebrate your convict heritage.
"*anti-racist. ""Racist"" is just another slur for 'white', like 'cracker' . Trying to make it work in any other way rings hollow."
This cracked me up!
When nobody can tell or force you to pay up, being in debt isnt so bad.
Plot twist: the customer just found she's diabetic and that's why she's crying.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** CrimsonEagl3! ^(hug)
Yeah, obviously. But that the joke relies on calling upon how outraged [NAME] was that he was penalised. 
[NAME] actually just released an awesome video on the self help industry and it's relationship to these folks!
If they actually have more evidence that he was deeper than originally suspected, then I have no sympathy.
Thing is...it's the media the masses take in that is driving this anxiety [NAME] or AP reader isn't falling for this
WHY THE FUCK IS WES ON THE FLOOR, HE CANT DEFEND SHIT
And you'd be in prison.
I miss big daddy buff
Serving us Ornacia!!! Honestly though I love this look!
Factually incorrect. Those studies did not have anyone trying to tell the difference in wine age, which any sommelier could do.
>lox is optional How dare you put '[NAME]' in your flair! How dare you.. Mods! Mods! Apprehend this impostor!
Partly, I include even those that aren't going to jail.
That‚Äôs it guys, we‚Äôre racist now
That mustache looks like it smells.
"This is probably why people are fleeing CT. Our state is on fire and people just keep saying ""this is fine."""

I ask them straight why they don't respect my decision. That usually fixes it.
I love this information!
Thought I saw a shot glass in there the first time I watched this.
Great game! Got more intense as it went on.
The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives me anxiety.
Calm down, [NAME]. 
Another way to do it without screaming at your teammates!
The lucky ones died quick
Yeah dude, that's illegal in so many ways.
No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
Suffering from success...
You know this is really messed up and unacceptable, but it mainly forced the realization that I‚Äôve never played with Omniknight.
but think of how fun it would be!!
"""You can't stop me"" Ah yes, those playful words when referring to a sexual act..."
I love her attitude and confidence! She has such good sportsmanship
shits awesome!
"What exactly does it mean to be a ""savior"" and why does humanity need one?"

Ah, the old [NAME] to [NAME] to [NAME] to [NAME] pipeline.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs also cute‚Äù I say as I look at the 5k in LEGO I‚Äôm hoarding
Been getting this same feeling these days.. idk what it is I just have no drive anymore maybe once the cwl comes back it‚Äôll help
I love all the episodes with Doug Judy in it.
"When did he claim it was ""destroying Western civilization""?"
In the cap era no goalie has played as much as [NAME] has the last 2 years on a per games basis
Huh that‚Äôs her?! She appears on this sub every 3 days and she looks *so different* every time!!
How random. I did that just riding around town for no reason and saw that lighting.
I can't do that....I don't know how to hard boil eggs sooooo
To add, from what I hear he is actually a stand up guy and not at all the douche that the tweet/comments are about.
Gods speed brother.
OMG THOSE TINY SHOES! *desire to boop snoot intensifies*
I'm sorry but as someone who travels alone I would be pissed if I was told I can't drink at the bar by myself.
Weed has never killed anyone. Until now.
You can smell the basement from here on him
There‚Äôs some Rask sparks!
Looks pretty dope.
Congratulations, there are success stories in this group. Forge on with your life but watch out for other (jerkfaces). 
I think that's a minority, not the majority there.
That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
Even a Ford dealer? Thanks for responding, I'll likely sell it privately.
Great vid but horrible grammar. [NAME] i had to read the title 4 times
I hope last night was fun enough to warrant the hassle today.
So sorry to hear about your abnormal growth. I'm now green with envy. Are there other celestial gods that can identify with existence?
Otter is another one - think young, slimmer, less hairy 
Probably not making good pass decisions.

Or you can just support your local farmers that slaughter their animals in an ethical and way less horrifying way.
Because of my adhd I do this with everything.

I feel like some people here think top mind means anything they disagree with.
Glad to help!
Yes, they suck for making a profit off of people who are proven to be high risk. How dare they!
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you‚Äôre doing better. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
That would be so nice to see
I'm interested, more than I should be.
Haha, I feel that
[NAME]: I just want them to get things going. [NAME]: This is the competition!
According to Google the quote is from a book by [NAME].
No they shouldn't. Mental illness is a serious thing and we shouldn't encourage crazy people but instead help them
She was gonna beat him with him
Yeah - thanks - I vaguely remember this. I wonder what her net worth was year by year? Too lazy to investigate.
I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
Yo u r awesome op. Gold me :D
I liked the Celtics until I started following barstool.
I hear lobsters are great
So sorry about your loss. It's so heart wrenching xoxox
They play loud trap music.
Lol. I will be bartending and serving.
Cat's trying to tell you to take your damn shoes off
I just changed my status and didn‚Äôt have it show up on the feed to draw attention. Those within my circle of friends already were aware.
Hell yeah. Happy they pulled it off together for their city. This is a great story in [NAME] eventual great career
>Bad request. this is some dank-tier meme that I'm not authorised to see, thanks [NAME]!
You should have an AP that respects you ...not just one that wants to use you.
yikes, as someone who dislocates things often ([NAME]), this scares me!
Seems like every season she is less hot. Too bad
Those are different, you don't tie that shit to the weakest part, they just stay on there by magic
Good call. Run!
I should stop jumping in elevators.
All game types are easy ekia. You sound jealous.
Try out ESEA brother it is way less toxic and almost no cheaters (as far as I noticed, played 240 faceit matches and that is hella toxic)
How does she hear everyones prayers?
Thank you good sir! I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing!
Available 24/7? You could put a ring on it and still not get that kind of service.
[NAME] ‚ÄúGood! It‚Äôs such a distraction to the team!‚Äù
Do crime? Now you're sounding like a true Lvl. 35 [NAME].
The right had both houses and the presidency and they wait until they lose the house to pretend they care about passing wall funding. So brave.
Yeah I think I‚Äôll just wait until things are more sure. Thanks so much!
Thanks a lot [NAME] /s
You know, I'm rather disappointed, but admire your cunning at the same time
Just go home already.
Your house/estate must be first on the route. Delivery normally starts at 8am.
I sure hope so...
[NAME] was pretty god damn brutal too.
It‚Äôs okay my mother in law left her Prius running outside my house for overnight and most of the next day.
This one is by [NAME]! Your suggestion was funny to me, and you've been blessed with your joke being DR Onion #20!
I didn't realize it was that common of a thing for guys to do xD
Hmmm, can I see that statistic claiming Rowan engineering is that high?
So..the head [NAME], is afraid of being rammed?
Thank you for doing your service. The world is now a better place because of you
What's he whining about, I am only 52 and stuck on SSI now and only getting 1400.00
I can't believe the guy is still hanging around.
Her only number one this decade was featuring on Perfect with [NAME] :(
I think making fun of him will just piss him off.
Prove he harassed them. If there was actual evidence, I would imagine at least one of the kids would‚Äôve put up a video. 
Just gotta injure 3 more
And chocolate comes from child slavery.
I think we have the same grinder. Love the bong!
For me, the only thing that makes it cringe is [NAME] covering his mouth
Yet reporters are so Liberal party friendly that they are not putting any difficult questions to [NAME] and dejong and [NAME].
This isn't a meme its a cry for help
Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?
This is oddly wholesome. I love it.
That's where your mind went? Most of us instantly think about Winnie the Pooh and the Hundred Acre Woods, man. What's wrong with you?
This feeling is so bad
Go twice a day, every day. Only way the bleeding stops. It blows.
Also whenever I try to stop focusing on her I think about her morep
But how can a [NAME]?
Also there's better ways we can spend taxpayer dollars than on another election.
Say that you like her
Is it a radical opinion to say no two consenting adults should not be able to kill each other lol
After he did the one year contract last year I'm not seeing him staying here with no improvement from our team.
My 47 year old sister is still creeped out by the original theme show's music. She refuses to watch it.
what are you doing here, [NAME]
Stop doing weird things
If he doesn‚Äôt play tomorrow then we should start worrying
*Duck Tales! whooh ooh* *Every day they're out there making* *Duck Tales! whooh ooh* *Tales of daring do bad and good luck tales! whooh ooh*
We only seem to hate them when they espouse murderous political philosophies responsible for more than 100 million deaths. Weird, huh?
Sorry, an errant surge of frustration

Whenever I'm having a bad day, I watch a few eps of Cosmos to chill out.

Excuse me... I have to return some videotapes.
Lmfao. Tax refunds. Must be nice to get one of those.

That boy just learn why you don't mess with a woman.
Ik was more curious with our communities opinion
Wooooo! Yeah! -applause-
Looks like your sources were closer to the actual value. Degrom just settled for $17m.
I hope your daughter gets the help she needs and someday gets better.
Disgusting, but fascinating.
Thanks [NAME]
You're delusional
No, this sub adores puig lol
What was that, I couldn't hear you over my easy to clean cookware! 
Good. I'm glad that you are getting help.
Lol. I was fan of that show and that line prior to becoming a fan of Arsenal and recently put the 2 together.

I'm afraid that will leave Britain no better. Can't imagine the ruckus if remain wins.
The 10 game rule for expansion also includes AHL games, so regardless of his stint up here he was going to be made available in the Seattle draft
Have vid to reaction ?
I'm not advocating eating the pain away, but bring apples just in case.

BPC-157 may help you in healing. I wish you the best. You totally dodged several bullets.
A good response to most of the criticisms of millenials.
"I'm a bit late. What's the ""AAAAAH FUCKING WATER"" reference?"
My favorite pod when they are fresh & clear. Sadly, all of my recent packs look like dark brown syrup pods. 
It's very normal in most parts of the world. It just rightfully appears horrifying to those in 1st world countries.
So we should stop caring about other people and only look out for ourselves. That DOES sound like a baby boomer!
look up hypersexuality, it's tied with BPD but not every pwBPD experiences it 
The whole country is an incompetent scam.
You‚Äôve just exemplified your own idea, thank you for further explaining it. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
I've said it before, but yuck, kissing that bloody mouth... Watch out, [NAME], you don't know where that's been.
to stop any confusion we're talking about this photo
so stoked this is happening. My boyfriend and his bff made plans immediately when they saw the commercial for it.
I was love bombed, then ghosted... and it broke me
I‚Äôm sure mueller was stumped on this until he hopped on reddit and saw this sound advice
To be fair, [NAME] is an amazing broadcaster.
You spend $175 a month for three people?
Okay, carry on then. Just thought I‚Äôd make sure you recognized that there was a difference.
Is anyone else really sad about how much plastic surgery she's had? I guess [NAME] self esteem issues werent that much of an act

Is this cronometer? Thanks.
Made my day
I did rank them above protista.
is it dangerous to take a quick photo while stopped at a red light
Comparing [NAME] to a tantruming toddler isn't new but comparing him to one's *own* toddler is bizarre.
What happened to one of your star players?? i saw the headline 'freak injury' or someting like that.. but i was too scared to see someting gruesome..
Play something else and come back later. You‚Äôre burning yourself out
I miss seeing us have desperate intense energy. Maybe next game

We got a great view around 9pm before the rain!
Am i missing something or is this an antijoke that doesn't belong here?
29? Double digits are too damn many.
[NAME]. is getting REALLY good!
You will eventually end up as an awful person who abandoned her. Might as well be sooner than later!
You're an amazing person OP. Please keep doing you!
And with the employee says ‚Äúwhat coworker? I‚Äôm working alone today.‚Äù
Free dog!

Many great years in these jerseys, would love to see them come back as our 3rds with the 1970s originals for the 50th Anniversary season
Yep. Been there. Watching my baby crying while vomiting and her eyes looking at me so hurt was hard.
[NAME] woke up, it was all a dream, he was really looking forward to King [NAME] visiting Winterfell. They had a good time
>This game is dying because toxic people like you ruin it. Speak for yourself
YES FUCK THE LEAFS. MAY THEY CONTINUE TO CHOKE IN THE POST SEASON.
Congrats! How long was the journey? Did you stick with [NAME] the entire time?
Damn, he sold all out for that kick
Nah coal is pretty inert from an environmental standpoint. If the barge wasn't hauling oil, gasoline or chemicals there isn't much to impact the river.
Well that is perfect for going pew pew online, do you use the fixed lte or the rain sim only deal? 
I know they finally gave Return of the King best Pic but my favorite out of the three was Two Towers. They are all great though.
Well that's because you're close-minded. But meh. I don't need your respect. ;)
[NAME] wouldn't breathe the same air as an anti vaxxer, don't slander her like this.
My baby niece does this. She fell down a couple stairs in her time and now is real careful with them
WHAT you guys get this show on Netflix? We certainly do not get it in Canada what is this bullshit
Biting the hand that feeds them
ISN'T YOUR CLUB RUN BY A JABBA-THE-HUT-LOOKING DONALD-TRUMP-ACTING MORON WITH A ~~FIVE SIX SEVEN TEN~~ FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN?
That's awesome, good for you! This sub needs wayyy more posts like this. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll never have a playoff mandate‚Äù go fuck yourself [NAME]
... [NAME] derangement syndrome sufferer spotted. What drivel you crazy lunatics say... The lies and falsehoods along with the out of place fearmongering is getting really annoying...
The man literally elevated any role he touches.
Voter fraud is way too easy to pull off, I know from experience 
Ah the old cross your legs to make it look like you have hips trick.
 Calm down and relax are the worst things to say to a woman, ever. 
Lucrative. I like it.
I am also a doctor and his legs are in fact discolored. But seriously dude go to the doctor.
Yeah this is definitely a wooosh.
Yeah it ringed a bell but i wasn't sure of the church
That‚Äôs always what I thought as well, but isn‚Äôt that essentially being transphobic, etc? 
Why was this post removed? It wasn't even bad.
The attraction and the action are two separate things, and you know that. No one chooses who they are attracted to. Stop it. 
I tried at a joke that relates to the post...
Annnnd that's too far. I think you should go home and rethink your life.
That was painful.
"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
This guy is a hack lmao
It's a waste of water to shower that often.
I wish I could get 9 usd per hour in my job. (not American).
I‚Äôm going to be here instead of the chat room personally
Let me add to them - it was awesome. Also unexpected!
No one has the stinky pinky when everyone has the stinky pinky.
When hes nailing threes though its a glorious thing.
Skinny Security Bro brings the bantz!
> complains about fun > plays game mode with the most fun > loves it FTFY
Do you know of a strike with greater participation? If so, I'd love to hear of it!
I‚Äôve heard them say they are less likely to get a job.
I love life, happy new year boys!
I'm all for finding ways of reducing gun violence but this seems to just be arbitrary and capricious.
Well that‚Äôs not what was said he said drugs that kill you sooner than your meant to die.. nicotine fits that description
Choose wisely, you ....
You can do it girl! I believe in you! :)
Pretty much lol
The power dynamics argument is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever - unless it‚Äôs someone who has a *direct* influence on your life or outcomes.
I‚Äôm on it. Will be recruiting family and friends as well. Thank you üôèüèª
They blew up my feelings :'(
It's not about the prizes, OP.
>ageism Lol. Nobody's *discriminating against* these folks cuz they're teenagers. Settle it down, mate.
While you were pickling your okra, i was *pickling my brain* ...waitaminute
Any time he's passionate about something. I love seeing passionate people and 9/10 want to rip your clothes off.
It's Snake and Otacon bro-hugging it out after Otacon went through some spoiler stuff.
Or, you can just accept that extremists didn't reason their way into extremism and you can't reason them out of it. 
If you went through the campaign, idk what needs to be explained üòÇ 
natural selection will rape her anyway so...
Yeah, Inbox didn't have those so I forgot all about it until they killed it.
I hope your relationships are no longer abusive either physically or emotionally.
Yeah I switched to maining NM in 6 as well and it was the exact wrong game to do that lol
No joke. Physics or chemistry I can see but comp 101? I‚Äôm surprised he has the ability to find the internet
You are totally right. What I meant was:
/r/keto too believe it or not.
Broke-ass street smarts are the real street smarts.
Yep, sure is. Have things gotten better for you, though?
You could still pay them... Just saying.
What I‚Äôm getting from all but the second is that mothers have become less abusive to their children.
Giants are getting him even though if take him. He wants them too so no room for us
Such a good doggo, and no one gets to pet her and let her know.
The rams seem pretty happy with [NAME].
Sorry to hear that brother! Solid advice and power and love to you. Here is knowing things will get better and that you're a champ!
i mean yeah but people need to understand when someone needs something other than just sexual comments and maybe some actual support
No idea, maybe say nothing..............
[NAME] wants his jokic nipple back. He must suckle
All this guy did was ask what a bronie was. I'm not understanding the hate
Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
Glad I tend to post pics of my cats and not myself.
The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase 
This is ugly af sry
eh, no. Maybe wood can be an alternative if thon is out of the option, but i will never get the allure behind ersan
The pain for the victims just goes on and on. He was outrageously vile to the end as he continued his efforts to flip the narrative.
Ok so now you know what this dude is about. Give him no more chances and move on past him asap.
Yeah it is, I hate it so much, I wish I woke up earlier.
[NAME] is my least favorite on the station.
Worst feeling ever
Haha... nice
The stress of electoral politics seems to be incredibly bad for one‚Äôs health.
Group hug to you and our fellow redditors :)
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
thank you for taking the time to answer, im freaking out big time
Ha, you must be in Wisconsin. I remember TYME machines.
That game was great. THOT, be gone...
Yes, you are a lucky man. Treat her well, for the rest of your life.
That all-star who won the calder
The Sephardic Temple in my area offers traditional non-equalitarian services, so it‚Äôs not an official Sephardic synagogue?
Love this. I thought I replied this morning, but I‚Äôm definitely taking your ideas and going to try them! Best of luck
You should take the time and go to the doctor.
Nah man there's nothing you can say to persuade people.
I bet you 1 reddit gold that [NAME] and [NAME] have a better combined ERA than [NAME] and [NAME] in 2019. Barring any major injuries
I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
[NAME] does love [NAME] I absolutely love Turkey- it's a shame I don't see myself visiting any time soon
Nah see that's the kind of pessimism that makes you more depressed. Even if they're not genuine you can still take it to heart.
Haha imagine if that limo in Vancouver where him, [NAME], and [NAME] were shirtless had a dash cam.
He‚Äôs just pure blubber. No muscle.
Step 1. Choose a new team (avoid Carlton and GC) Step 2. Enjoy!
> pushed all of them Hey dumbass you pushed the emergency button
You're saying [NAME] sucks at drafting...?
It's all good man, glad you shared it. Just felt I should defend my stance as well.
I don't know what would have happened had you tried to get past, but I'm glad you just noped the duck out of there.
There's so much missing information that is hard to dissect. Did you initiate the divorce? What was the reason for the divorce?
You did this, YOU DID THIS
Comeback in a couple months and we'll see.
Vancouver is even more ridiculous.
I like your babyüòç
How about catching the tines of your fork on a small hole and hearing it scrape across four other holes?
Even if you were a woman, your personality is so vile and yuck I would happily do 20 years in prison for murdering you.
Don‚Äôt quote me on there being fish in there, it just looked like a nice picture.
well guys it was fun. [NAME] passed up the open three ffs
Did a lousy job, my dishes are still dirty.
"""I'm sorry mam, but we dont allow children in the store unattended, so you are going to have to leave."" "
Great idea! :) I'd be happy to give her a good reference!
Roger that thanks
honestly I dig it, though [NAME] could rock it better than anyone ever could!
Yeah she is. Do you think [NAME] faced the same problems [NAME] had? like you said major problems in the prosecution
‚ÄúDeforestation‚Äù - The brilliance of this idea wont be obvious until the green mold starts to blossom on the bread. /s
So you're gay, but you hate men? Yeah, good luck with that working out for you.
Yeah usually I‚Äôm defensive around people I don‚Äôt know casually walking around with things that could be powerful weapons.
"More comments than upvotes lol ""Most Democratic"" How do you even measure that? "
I hate it and I love it.
Lol thankfully you guys only had a pedophile as 27th and 31st Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama.
I'm tall but no one is attracted to me, because I'm ugly, I have a big nose and ears.
Because they are triggered. I‚Äôm just stating my opinion. It‚Äôs a bit fun.
Oh sure, that makes it much easier to pay your bills with no money. The money will just come at some point in the future! 
That might be an issue when it comes to meeting girls all the way around. Generally we love a guy who can make us laugh.
I do have few friends from there and it's a lovely nation too.
I can't delete my account, so I'm just gonna edit the post itself. Thank you for your help!
This team isn‚Äôt winning the 2019 cup. I‚Äôm focused on 2022 and beyond
Wow thanks I would've never figured out that you were sarcastic without that /s
What a load of crap !!
This series is so unapologetic in its outlandishness that I just can‚Äôt help but love it.
Such pretty kitties!
Woah! 4 new maps in a year! That‚Äôs so lucky!! Not like we got 10+ maps in 2017 for bf1..
He's not the [NAME] he's just a very naughty boy!
20 seconds, how about you guys?
Congrats on the mild success of your stolen story
Who ate the Carolina Reaper? Lol I‚Äôd prob be using that lid to knock myself out from the heat
looks like we got a double win today!!
Valium/Diazepam is much much more enjoyable than Alprazolam/Xanax IMO. I love the muscle relaxation. It feels so good, combined with an opiate, 
Apparently the bull shark is hyper aggressive due to the amount of testosterone it has. They're basically roid-heads in perpetual roid-rage with massive teeth.
You are an amazingly strong person!
Hell yeah bois
>Relax ms bi weeb who leans left haha... thanks i love it
Yes, yes you did
That‚Äôs good to know- thank you!
"love seeing ""donkey kong 64"" written on some official government paper congrats hbomb, you deserve it all champ "
Excuse me, my friends cousins uncles brothers friends fathers nephews sons friends great grandfathers great great great grandfathers friend was a police officer back in 1776
They wanted me to talk directly to them but I've been refusing. I hope our relationship improves quickly. I really do. Thanks
I'm totally the last one!
Society started going downhill at exactly the point where I became negatively affected by social change.
Females would be pressured the other way obviously
When it comes to cooking thermometers are your best friends.
I have no idea what you're talking about, I'm in the UK we have a different class system !
Her face oddly looks way narrower in this picture.
Just saw your history. Makes complete sense now. Your a trumptroll. Bye.
Yeah personally I would‚Äôve brought [NAME] back lol [NAME] always had trouble staying healthy
I‚Äôm a baptist and I laughed at this statement, have a nice day funny boi.
Still love you [NAME], get well soon :'(
I was trying to make a friend that was being a douche jealous by telling him I was having a 3 some. Accidentally messaged it to my father.
This makes me want to get nipple piercings but I‚Äôm too scared to :/
Now you're appropriating the Bullingdon Club's culture.
Damn, you're right. I could've sworn I saw a 99% up there.
Nutter is a great word for it. I haven't even gotten into her claim that she is psychic yet. That's a story for another day.
The father clearly ran away lol
I'm baffled
I like it I just wish he‚Äôd drop the m and apostrophe
Is that Guildford? There always seems to be plenty of zombie-like pedestrians around town!
it grows on you, fresh packs of creme are actually pretty tasty and they hit right 
oh, so he is insane?
"By who? Hate the Flames all you want, but there's nobody competing for a wildcard spot that will ""dunk"" them in the first round"
yes i emailed him and within 10 minutes he emailed back and asked me to call him directly. we spoke for over 30 minutes.
DmC fans love DMC 5 the fuck this is what i just don't understand we don't pick DMC or DmC WE LIKE BOTH there are no sides
I just woke my wife up to make sure that she was okay before I could lay down.
Weird I'm short and have anxiety and depression and somehow I'm not an incel.
Can we get a guard too? This is my dream.
she always acts like the older sister who‚Äôs copping out of babysitting, it‚Äôs ridiculous.
Cursed image.
This is from ralph lauren? [NAME], someone put their designer out of their misery.
Why does it matter? Isn't this just 2 oppressive systems of control fighting against each other?
85 attack? More like 8.5 attack.
Just because they think it‚Äôs attractive doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs sexist
F then.
No one likes him enough to tell him he‚Äôs wearing women‚Äôs glasses
Absolutely nothing! LOL
He specifically called t a ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù rather than a plan. Commitment means they told tulo he is the shortstop.
Or SFO. The only one that comes close is SEA and it‚Äôs a looooot smaller.
Glad you learned from it m8 and hopefully you are doing okay now
Such an ignorant comment, his reasoning is public information and is right
This doesn't belong on the competitive sub; it doesn't have anything to do with the competitive aspect of the game.
that was so sad :(
You here to admit you are fine with existence once born? I thot so
I think you can find it in pieces on YouTube. But CW seed should work. It‚Äôs odd that it isn‚Äôt.
Oh my [NAME] that's so awkward
[NAME] is a homophobic bigot and deserves to be attacked for acting on those beliefs.
Upvoted for visibility. Disapprove of the poll results.
[NAME] can be her new [NAME] and she is female !
Fine. I hope he has a fine wife and she‚Äôs fine if he shall need to pay a fine.
I hope you find him, but WHY didn't you exchange numbers???
i love the eyes wtf they‚Äôre staring into my soul
The dept I work in went a few weeks ago for an afternoon thing.
I don't think it's that simple. There was a lot riding on making 7 and taking too many risks probably isn't the best answer.
Please post any news you may find about her fate. This is so sad and so wrong. We need to know what happens to her.
Pff sticking the bumper back on isn‚Äôt a massive task, I‚Äôd call it a win 
That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless.
Ok but why won‚Äôt that guy stop petting the Sea Doggo? He‚Äôs obviously not that into you, sir.
Well no matter what her bio says, if you are ugly, you are done for. 
Honestly thought they were the same thing, thanks for the correction and the expansion of my terrible vocabulary.
Wouldn't the bully be the Polygon employee?
Remember folks, you can visit to report rule breaking behaviors including brigading and harassment. Do your part to help stop abuse on Reddit!
Would you‚Äôve still got with her if you‚Äôd known beforehand? No judgement, just curious.
She broke that young man's toes, ankles, and knees on that fall. lol
Man.. I really loved that team.
Thanks for remembering. I have since added to my post :-)
They are looking pretty stacked this year
Yeah I grew up watching them play in the sand unis. I like it more than the standard road gray.
Waiting until Saturday or you test the method on someone sick.
Be good-looking.
This is just such an obvious troll.
Short and simple... More embarrassing being a janitor or being in the unemployment line?
"I love his calls even when things get ""pear-shaped"""
Seahawks fans are very bad at just taking the L.
The kind of women they'll never get.
COUNT YOUR CALORIES. EAT ABOVE YOUR TDEE EVERY DAY AND YOU WILL GAIN WEIGHT. IT'S SCIENCE.
Same cinematographer, [NAME]. He's incredible
Yeah that happens t
Oh believe me, we‚Äôd love that too
What an ass. I almost downvoted this out of anger.
Woooooooahahhohohohohho nice one Bembry to [NAME].
We're not a democracy. WE'RE A COUNTRY
I'm cautiously optimistic about him.
He is 100% [NAME]. Not using [NAME] for the role of Admiral [NAME] is missed opportunity ;)
Oh for sure. Sometimes I wonder if they are actually harming there cause with the over the top hypocrisy the newcomers seem to see it quite quickly.
You're making yourself look more stupid with every reply. Google what the heck model organisms are.
I got into one building, but I‚Äôm planning on going back soon. pictures ^
Yeah I don't think so lol
Old news. Been posted two or three times already.
I heard someone say one... ‚Äòeverywhere is is better but Perth is the best!‚Äô Glad you enjoyed your holiday!
By being intellectually dishonest? Ok.
Wow he wants people to donate so he can make a large profit off his atm? Lmao Good gig if you can get it I guess...
Guns go off accidentally all the time. Don‚Äôt point them at someone unless you plan to kill them.
he's an awesome bro
I remember seeing [NAME] in the States and smelling weed during the entire concert. Not really surprising, he loves the stuff.
Thankyou! Good luck with your search! An AP is out there for you!
[NAME] isn‚Äôt interested in ceremony but is interested in having time with you. Love this!
Your name needs some work LOL
I'm on episode 8 and this is where the show has gotten boring af for me.
I'm concerned for my fellow redditor. You seem to not be feeling well, and hallucinating. Shall we have a mod come check on you? 
Get that double double [NAME]!
Did the refs bet the game?
Thanks, I‚Äôll look into it 
>!Royalty, half of them are all related one way or another!<
> His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent
Well good luck if you yourself help with that, i'm out of here, i can't be bothered fighting with USSR stans.
Sounds dreadful.
It's ridiculous that [NAME] has inspired way more people to join rather than leave but there are way more media articles by people who have left.
For the love of all that is good and holy, please find competent broadcasters NBCSN.
Is this a real question or a snark?
Now I'm over thinking. Maybe I have justified it to be able to move on and get closure???
That‚Äôs amazing. You‚Äôre all amazing
Or men! no homo
You are very pretty. You also seen to have good taste in popsicles, that looks delicious.
This video was close to being the most famous video in history
Quite superpower you got there, op. Reminds me of [NAME] in Unbreakable. U beautiful person!
His DBPM as well as his OBPM is better than Embiid's
You got down voted.. but you're absolutely right. I am now looking into one. Sweet.
>We banned Whose alt are you with your mod-powers?
Instagram is in fact owned by Facebook
It's like [NAME] *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. He had some great source material but utterly botched the execution.
Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play
"You should check out [NAME] ""thank you God"" "
Hand ur phone to a buddy and let them send the text asking her out. Worst thing is she says no, but it's better then not knowing 
Congrats on approaching the situation with logic unlike most everyone else
Oh wait that's tonight?!?! Totally watching üòé
SmH iS ShAkE mY hEaD
Ahhh makes sense. They were being sarcastic but it went over my head haha. Thank you.
Get rid. This is a toxic relationship that is making you unhappy. You are making all efforts for nothing in return.
Or maybe it was because the government can't collect the tax on it
"He didn't ""die"". The dude behind pink guy doesn't want to continue being pink guy"
That dog did not want saved at all.
I know I don't know the Spanish alphabet but I can't believe I didn't catch that before
What will you do if you don't go?
he's obviously helping
Thats weak as fuck.
Same to me. But she has a handicapped placard but drives [NAME] and herself. WHY?
Omg creepy!
Spice Burger. Delicious!
My bio is pretty funny... I got ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre a Catfish then you‚Äôll be charged a call out fee of ¬£120.49‚Äô
Thank you for explaining! I‚Äôm only 31 but now I feel old lol
Here's an excerpt from Australian law that seeks to define hate
Holy fuck dude. Use the mute button. Your feelings were hurt with one message, now click it, thanks ^_^
That would be an unfamiliar feeling
I probably wouldn't have responded out of confusion.
I was hoping that wouldn't be the case, that really sucks man. Hope you find something that ignites your passion again!
Then these people are worrying for no reason.
They're cowards.
>It also means no applause lines. No problem, just get the white house staff to clap for.... OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
in many cases both. but this has nothing to do with Japan. You can't stay on topic, can you?
Or if she even has any...
> I think [NAME] is the best QB Prospect since Luck üòê
what a psycho
It really isn't unhinged. I don't know if you were here a couple of months back but what this guys is saying is accurate.
Beautiful shots. Makes me want to finally take the jump into photography.
WE AINT NO RACISTS. EVERYONE CAN BE HATED EQUALLY.
[NAME] looked so lost for 3 quarters. No pocket awareness. Terribly inaccurate. I hope this version of [NAME] is here to stay.
Then you‚Äôre entirely ignorant
She did you a favor by not dragging it out. Cut bait and move on.
‚ÄúFall in love with at least one physical, one artistic, and one intellectual pursuit‚Äù ‚Äî This is great advice! Thank you üòä
I really need to get more sleep.
> I'm genuinely curious Sure.
[NAME]. Your mom will never be your boys best friend. That part is so cute!
Damn this guy just had a bad day!
Except 47 out of the 59 tribes were in support of the pipeline. Don't let facts get in the way of your narrative though.
As long as he knows [NAME] won‚Äôt take his shit lol
I really hope she wasn‚Äôt trafficked. It‚Äôs more prevalent in the US than a lot of people realize :(
In reality the kid said: ‚Äúfuck off noob, Genji grandmaster main here boiii‚Äù
You‚Äôre letting psychopathic people ruin your ability to take a joke. That is a mark of a weak man.
It's too bad they don't use that gorgeous high altar.
What happend? I dont get this video. Is there any sense in it or just some random talking?
The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.
900 IQ Play by that tracer to use her 300 Damage Ultimate on a 600HP Character who has a healing/damage resistant ability.
Anyone that emotional that passes on gains because of some grudge he holds for a coin shouldn't be involved in crypto.

IMAGINE ABOUT TO LOSE TO LAKERS W/O LEBRON, I FCKING LOVE THIS TEAM
Come on, I want to know how it goes.
Ha ha, that's absolutely fair enough. :)
Awesome, glad you like it. I need to get one this week now.
By that logic its seedy and insincere for google to act like they care about Homealone.
I used to have no problems finding them, but I‚Äôm struggling really hard now
You / he must be doing an excellent job, then. I've never encountered one. 
REALITY BENDS TO MY WILL!
I love how their comparing [NAME] one shtick (not including highlighter) to the comedy skills of queens with actual performance talents.
This has been reposted so many times the photo is degrading.
Mr. Met is a legend! Outrageous. Now... If you wanna talk about hateworthy mascots... The Phanatic fits the bill.
Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too
Came for the murderino and stayed to say I drive like [NAME] a lot and it‚Äôs bad lol
I answered, and then asked if you can think of any legitimate uses. Apparently you can't.
thought you were talking about gum (eucalyptus) trees. They're known to drop branches and many people are killed by them.
hmmm interesting... i guess your an interesting lady. PM me then. :)
I wouldn't think any less of him than I already do.
Oh I see what ya did
>backpfeifengesicht I'm doing my best to memorise this. I have a feeling it will come in handy.
Dude just wanted to say more words.
That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not an elected official. Learn this one simple trick!
One time at the moment, but I did feel so full of energy after.
....that's *naivet√©*, break the cycle... ## DONT BE NEGATIVE 3.0
I have a feeling [NAME] wasn't innocent in that fight. Not that it's ok, but I instigated shit too. They are on drugs.
I'm not conflating anything, I'm describing my experience. I'm curious, where are you from? I'm in the rural south. 
If Ww3 breaks out in northern Asia as people expect. It will make things worse for you guys in the states - not better
Shouldn‚Äôt really expect him to be doing well.. he‚Äôs a 3rd stringer playing 6man minutes
[NAME] looks like a guy who owns a number of body pillows and anime figures.
If you were still here you probably heard mine! He‚Äôs a coonhound and likes to sing
True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
I thought you were making a joke about AI not taking over while asking a bot to remind you ;)
Oh hi there stereotypical psycho right-wing tabloid sound bite.
I like it that way :) My point is that you‚Äôre an attention seeker like [NAME]
Go on...
I see you're a man of culture as well. But realistically this will never happen because... Disney :/
Sorry, your diverse, inclusive baby was aborted.
All it takes is just a bit Practice and thanks!
[NAME] wrote a really technical and really awesome article in the Athletic about this game. Holy shit haha worth reading if you are a ball nerd.
Their album is awesome, too.
OK, is there a crossover between herb and spice in your language (Norwegian?) I was confused by 'North American Provence spice'.
Klokslag 12 I find really enjoyable, horror movie podcast, Im not a horror fan but I find these dudes very entertaining
It‚Äôs ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
I think we all know [NAME] has the best curves in team history.
Thank you. Give her and your other doggie extra kisses for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't see how my reply was whataboutism when my point of contention is directly related to the point.
When you can't hold in years of emotional trauma anymore
Came here looking for the knowitall that explains the difference. Disapointed in reddit today.
Thanks dude. Wish you the best with OP, personally I'm done.
Seems like a lot of time to wait ... i might need other options.
Slurps big gulp. ‚ÄúFood chain bro‚Äù
I forsee success in your future endeavors.
My girl [NAME]. She deserves the world.
This was the only way I got to use Minecraft back when I was in middle. Use it wisely
Hey, I‚Äôve learnt something here today, so thanks! 
I‚Äôve never stolen anything to do this with an Italian accent.
Invite everyone in the server, it fills fast
Look on the bright side. I dont know what your bright side is but just look at it.
That‚Äôs not what I said, but ok. 
"He also lost a QB battle to a 40 year old and rookie ""project"" QB that everyone thought needed to sit a year pre-draft."
I'll put it into context. I love DBZ. I hated Battle of the Gods + Resurrection of Freeza. I *fucking adore* Super Broly.
"Who are real ""[NAME]?"" Be specific which, denomination is the one true denomination?"
aw :(
I figured as much. If I were them I'd definitely be sceptical.
They might not be intending to use the main actors.
Just a spat probably, nothing serious I'd think.
Like and smash that subscribe button, I'll see you in the next video for my best v-bucks giveaway yet

That was fun.

It makes it especially delicious when our one sub with ~100 active members gets accused of controlling the entire political debate on Reddit
I kept reading and apparently he was able to pull out 10k to his bank account, so he currently has doubled his money
Really? I thought he was a Solicitor before Newstalk?
ConEd vault in my office building blew, and now the entire building is closed for the whole day. What a clutch start to Friday
As a contractor this is a huge nono. If it's not on paper it not on your wall either.
Oh, I don‚Äôt work there. My bf is in a band that plays there often. 
Thanks for the link! I've been looking too and there are like 200 in the area I called one and waiting to hear back.
It could indeed apply to many gods from many different creations myths...which is his point. Everyone knows!
Yeah like I just get more dissociated. Music sounds better and stuff
nice shot of that full moon on the first day of winter!
Wow, that really hurts coming from a demented troll sockpuppets brigading me on this sub
This one has been around longer than you, buddy.
This is as cool as it was burgers and fries and started the Omnibus to collect the first few pages were just so much to unpack there...
Its often not like they can fight back or, hell, remember the treatment to give them bad rep later on
We don‚Äôt need another 5‚Äô8 slot receiver with good college production.... See [NAME] and [NAME].

I'm not surprised someone asked that. Good [NAME], people are stupid.
They basically worship this.
Ding ding ding! We have a winner!
It really sucks that almost everything we know and love about [NAME] is either told to us by proxy through other characters or is the result of fan-fics/shipping.
Your right thanks
you'd have a point if the only use of a car was to kill people.
r/suddenlytrans? This is totally a joke I'd make if I grew
Shooting dogs to make our country safe!
Your welcome. Hope it all gets better.
LOVE JAMES TOO
You know that this happened in germany, do you?
God [NAME] is awful
Okay. Have a nice evening! üëçüèª
Most likely it‚Äôs not a tumour since cancerous tumours aren‚Äôt usually painful. You still should go check it out ASAP.
"FS haha you are some guy. >""Not even the [NAME]"" Purely hyperbolic i imagine ;)"
Clearly. Sometimes, this woman baffles me with her stupidity 
If the anime really ends that way there‚Äôs no way I see [NAME] and [NAME] get back together.
It's easy to overthink things online, I'm glad you gave him a chance.
Some disturbing thoughts, but I hope you‚Äôre in a better place now pal. 
Suddenly it‚Äôs gross
I really love playing him and going against him. Legion is overall my favorite killer. I respect everyone hating him although I dont understand why.
Sadly I don't think even half the people who watched the game are gonna hear about that.
When did they stick to those policies, sure the US isn't innocent, but fuck that? This hypocrisy is unbelievable, it's cringy FFS.
Only for a week? You are a great optimist!
"Love this. ""Where were we"" and ""what were we"" before birth? It really helps to think this way"
"They had been chanting ""we want tacos!"" Lol"
I don‚Äôt ever remember pithy. Childish and churlish feels more apt
You're mistaking a poor character for MC.
I hope so too, she deserves it.
We absolutely can't leave the first three rounds without an offensive tackle. Preferably Round 1 or 2
Am I the only one who finds this hilarious? Good for her!
Unable. It's not really possible. It's not his only interest but it's the one I can't really do anything about.
You're easily as classist as her.
OH LAWD HE COMIN!
This is the most early 2000s thing ever. I love it.
I'll have to think about that one but maybe if you're downüòÇ
Sorry im a french guy
Guys. I think OP blew burns in college and wants to feel better about it.
‚ÄúConspiracy and treason aren‚Äôt technically crimes‚Äù -[NAME]
As long as his other pics don't take himself too seriously, this is kind of funny
This is not polyamory. That's just a buddy. It sounds like he's completely taken it off the table.....
Can a Purdue or Indiana fan independently verify?
I think I found the rom somewhere, now I just gotta set it up. I hope I can manage to do that. 
Congratulations, that joke has only been made 89,401,327 times on reddit before. 
[NAME] has to lose it a some point, just hope it's not tonight.
Oh boy ü§£ü§£
If you‚Äôll check my medical records you‚Äôll see I have a crippling arthritis in me index fingers
Anybody know what injury [NAME] specifically has? LGD.
Oh wow I forgot [NAME] and [NAME]. I have not read it.. have a link?
That's fair, but it's gotta suck being one round off the qualifier and then watching your teammates go anyway without you.
the rubber coming off is always a problem
Thank you! My Bravo blog is
Cannot disagree with this one
As long as [NAME] isn‚Äôt a judge again, we can be optimistic
I'm doing a lot better. It means a lot that you checked in on me. Thank you!
Right now I'm listening to Stand By Me, I'm liking it 
Heroin definetley isn't safer than Ritalin. The whole reason people prefer prescription drugs are because they are cleaner, thus safer
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, I'm REALLY not ready.
It's extremely rude.
4-25 against teams with winning records. 0-7 on Monday Night Football. The guy can't show up when it matters.
As much as I don‚Äôt like his splits would have liked him on that contract that‚Äôs a huge miss for the dodgers imo.
Damn who died and gave u the Broncos
Crochet, my good friend
Posters all the way down.
I use 3 different credit unions and all of them are great. Used Wells Fargo for a short while and hated them.
I'm feeling hope for the first time in a long time.
Same here. Around the same time frame. Ill report back if it changes for me and ask if you can do the same. Thank you
If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control.
I love conspiracy theories with no shred of proof
I guess some people havent met meth
You're didn't vote for her you are obviously a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're the worst kinda person.
[NAME] presses and holds b button (I feel you op)
No, if the cat's going to escalate then he needs to as well. It's bath time. 
That would actually be awesome.
The move takes a lot of concentration, hence the blank stare of total focus. Ultra instinct 
Tbf he's not a dictator... Yet...
Guy looks like average [NAME] at the gym. Reddit acts like he the new anabolic king üòÇ I will go back to my cave now.
Try Venezuela. It's your communist utopia in action.
I'm not a victim at all. You're just a desperate loser who spends money on a guy he could watch for free.
This viral video of her gets posted every once in a while too: Her legs are ridiculously strong.
At least she had a great experience
Over thinking things on both sides.
I doubt people are *happy*, but they probably aren‚Äôt sad about someone who was potentially endangering others through their anti-science views.
It's on here daily. Karma whores eh?
I love truck drivers!!
Knife Fight used to be an awesome cooking comp show
Sadly not. [NAME] confirmed they couldn't make female premier skins for male characters and vice versa, because their hurt/hit boxes are different from one another.
[NAME] is a fucking god
Love and marriage
These are some of the most talented marbles I've ever had the honor and privilege of watching.
If you crack the code for getting a city job please let me know.
Depends on what you want to do, but I'd buy This
this aint it chief
What does that have to do with [NAME] having sex with a child, what's the point you're trying to make with that piece of information?
the knock off names are super cringey but i love looking for them
This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,
Damnit - I'm blind. It's 6am here - I should really go to sleep, but I want to see what happens next.
The fact that kids can't be failed without parental agreement is no sign that they're learning anything or improving when they advance in the education system.
Must be a terrible swim team. The only thing that your neck beard does is accentuates your double chin.
Where did people get this? It‚Äôs hilariously wrong.
Get out. And take your facts with you.
I assume not unless he gets premonitions of future memes.
He'd have to ask his mom
He loves buying people beer. He got into that industry to buy people beer.
This sub blows, and you‚Äôre on the wrong side of the circlejerk today
Because it was a common age for women to be engaged and married at that time.
Well you‚Äôre right it doesn‚Äôt but she won‚Äôt make you that worried
[NAME] will be [NAME]
So the time of death would be when the doctor confirms them dead?
Praying this goes to at least 4. I like both the players but would really like to see [NAME] play to his max GS potential
I thought they would be a little less crazy this year knowing they got their first super bowl but I should have known better.
[RELIGION] iconography is absolutely filled with insanely shredded men.
Yes, you have a butt that won't quit, after all! 
Thank you. It doesn't sound so bad, at least on paper.
I think she has a good chance
y'know, I should try that haha... (music gets depressing) ha
Stay on your feet Lovejoy
The best mori will always be Nurse's.
I am seeing the insane clown posse there in two weeks and I have no idea how I am going to get home covered in faygo
Why cant [NAME] get a call these last few games?
Thank [NAME] for you
You're a horrible person.
Hah. Thanks!
Move on bro. Don't sit around waiting for someone. If it's meant to happen later, it will.
It's both. Keep your eyes open and you'll see more..
Shows you that one must never underestimate the rust caused by ACL injuries
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt discipline my kid!‚Äù
This hurts me.
Kabhi Khushi kabhi gam? Slightly different but raichands were rich and mother was doing pooja.
Am I not supposed to have what I want? What I need?!?
A lot of people shit on wiki edits, but most of them give me a nice little chuckle
I'd heard that too, but always thought their differences were more artistic/professional than personal... Oh well, people grow apart. We still got Aquemini.
Follow rules 1 and 2 and you can have lame openers and you'll be fine.
Legally, you are responsible for damage or harm done as a cop is trying to apprehend you. You caused the dangerous situation by running.
Oh sweet I get [NAME] powers
[NAME], I don‚Äôt miss that guy. 
You just need to ignore him. He only crawls out when he can complain about traditional [NAME] or dem stupid republicans.
Okay thats cool I was asking because I didn‚Äôt know y‚Äôall better stop downvoting me
That‚Äôs gotta hurt.
Gangster as fuck bruh, that's why i fly a green bandana.
It happens so much that it really scares me tbh.
Let‚Äôs go [NAME], prove everyone wrong.
Everything is cool when no one gets hurt.. But as soon as something bad happens, we all scream idiots... Why...?
Firstly, congrats on not being pregnant!! Now there is nothing tying you to him and you're free to find greener pastures. :)
Just in case you weren‚Äôt sure he‚Äôs an [NAME], he decided to obstruct 20% of his windshield to remind you. 
Third date info, I reckon. Needs to be mentioned early on, but not everyone needs to know
Thank you :) I'll try to stay positive
Seen this result coming. Best result for us and rangers unfortunately.
The Lone Rangers
Another bad essay by me, sorry for butchering anarchism, anti-ableism and anti-psychiatry but I hope I got the point across :p
Same clothes and the door is black on the other side - looks so real!!
The video was leaked with the caption: >‚ÄúHere is America‚Äôs favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,‚Äù
Shout out to the two messy bots
That is awesome.
If you're smearing shit between your cheeks merely from standing might I suggest you take a wider stance when popping and maybe get some more fibre in your diet
Myself and Mr. [NAME] agree small breasted women make the best lovers.
He‚Äôs one of America‚Äôs greatest songwriters.
Then again, socialists have never been *particularly* averse to the odd spot of murder, have they?
Why? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen someone not like [NAME] irl or here. Witten I can see though.
**DON‚ÄôT USE THESE LINKS**
Eh... just watch the season. The leaked pic of untucked was the week she goes home.
You have to watch the live streams.
#1 rule you don‚Äôt say it you can think it but never say it
oh yah, no worries. I appreciate your time and thoughtfulness. 
Asides from the max number of choices each share, probably being shamed on the internet
[NAME] met and fell in love with her wines I see.
It's a [NAME] family tradition!
Even more of a reason to nurse on your side! :)
I LOVE THE HIGHS TOO. At least I know tomorrow I will hate them. Is the good worth the bad? Sometimes...
I don‚Äôt think that tells us any moralising lesson on the practice of incest.
He's done nothing to earn trust either. He got ran out of Miami
I haven't confirmed this, but apparently, [NAME] said his trilogy fight with [NAME] sucked because he had an inflamed vagina. 
I love them, it's so fun to jump around everywhere
Thanks for the recommendation! Hopefully my Ulta will have some to swatch!
Yep California, I would've been surprised if they cleared him.
Okaaaay? I'm not sure how to respond to that, no offense.
That's a great trailer. [NAME] needs more scars though.
We‚Äôre making all the MOVES!
Didn't realize I'm so famous!
Women are dangerous as hell too.
Last three times have been lost Final, won Final, lost ECF, which is insane. Just a shame that's over the course of 17 years
This is incorrect. Taiwan was regarded as an island of no importance.
Same. It's my favorite show to watch in the morning. The whole crew is so likeable.
Sorry if I was insulting, I just took your post as some commie type smugly trolling how stupid [NAME] is 
??? Like a duck on a June bug?
Y'all are fucking annoying
That sucks I'm sorry. Ive always been dismayed at how flippant people are.
I'm not sure what you're talking about. He removed his name off the records long ago.
I do not disagree with any of this. Good take, sir.
Thanks for reading!
Have a good one, mate. I wish you all the loves. Here, a potcoin for you.
I‚Äôm not sure why I just laughed so hard at this. It‚Äôs not but it‚Äôs funny!
"And also some anti-establishment types that don't like [NAME] because she's ""the establishment."" Luckily these sort of people are in the minority."
Such grace.
nice try buddy
Which is bizarre because [NAME] actually dubbed those scenes back in the day, but they apparently never used them ever.
Oof, what a bad and dated meme
I need to know this as well, so I hope no one minds if I leave a comment here.
No, what‚Äôs sad is saying the same message like it‚Äôs news. He‚Äôs a copy paste machine. No original thought.
But they were only contenting because they lucked into [NAME].
"He's saying he did very poorly though. ""LOST ALL but 1 or 2."""
Oh please lol
good guy kawhi
I mean ILB is a huge hole for this team. Why not protect any prospect? But we'll keep [NAME] and [NAME]...
Maybe you've been out of the game for a bit but literally every sentence is not a typical first date these days.
Thank you for your kind words and understanding. You are right on many levels.
Nope this whole thing has been deleted and we‚Äôre all banned. We are all now posting from the Shadow Realm.
Im also just a stranger, but if you need a friend online just shoot me a message!
Whatever keeps your inflated ego going strong, Captain.
As if I needed another reason to avoid the Galleria.
Wait, which ones can do it now? Seriously, I don't really know this one.
I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
The real villains are those aware of the cruelty of life, but then reproduce anyway.
It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
Great report! They are correct, it was never a hack.
Ah, yes, the good old ‚Äúglass elevator‚Äù
Like protesting for higher minimum wages and better benefits for worker? Yeah, we protest for the opposite in Canada.
[NAME] made boobi beautiful
If you are really so dead set against shoveling sidewalks, perhaps you should move to a warmer climate. 
it's so cold today I nearly cried just from the temperature and wind I DONT LIKE IT
the whole thing, it was just hard to describe/express given how it all happened and everything. 
Oh thanks this is really helpful
My man.
It is the internet. It's the place these guys call home.
Couldn't tell you. Unless i check the news i hardly notice the shutdown
Well, 1/2 has been done already!
The cynic in me is pretty sure they don't really do any of that.
I don't like [NAME] she is not relevant to the series.
You lost everything. So sad. Lots of lies from you. Next time do better. I love this. Friend. :)
I don't know why you even talk to human trash like this. Instead you should motivate him to leave her - at least that would be productive.
Kids Day in Toronto, Leafs STHs donate their tickets to kids so there's like 10,000 kids in the arena today. Pretty cool thing they started last year
This post makes me facepalm
Be prepared for many old men to hit on you
[NAME] is a fine woman leave her out of this.
He‚Äôs close. Flip [NAME] to fish for [NAME] Then go out and get [NAME]
Where the heck did the water bottle go??
# SOMEONE GIVE THIS GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!! #
Really? I‚Äôm not so sure, because I really do like her a lot.
I agree and I‚Äôm a man haha
Thanks... that's the laugh I needed today.
Guilty as well!
We know blocking [NAME] was [NAME] choice because he said it was.
I wouldn't ever make a broad generalization like that. Typical honkies, assuming stuff
No problem if you want further reading there is dedicated forums out there for punting.
Thanks. I'll go as soon as I can.
We don't care as much for 69. Hard to do properly. Glad it works for you. We prefer to take turns.
They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
I was more concerned that your comment held a frame of reference assuming it was real.
Thanks for the resources!
[NAME] is a happy boi!!
I think it's the only ability in the game where you can't really use it in combat.
nah I could get better if I wanted but it‚Äôs the peak meme see my post history
"I equally love and despise them when they talk about a player diving as ""flopping"""
Lord, he is extra sensitive. And I thought my ex was bad lol. 
I have no idea. I always imagined it was purely retail workers that browsed and posted here, but I might be wrong in this instance.
>Any [NAME] who is married will skip her Well just for fun let's talk for a moment. Going to send you a PM.
That's amazing, wow! People can be so good.
I was sleeping with my mouth open my dog started licking inside my mouth.
I'M MOTIVATED!
Glad they made it..
Fellow [NAME] reporting for duty!
Did you have to ask? Just pay the ticket and be done with it.
At least we know they have good taste
I know he will be, I'm just nervous. His face is just going to be so sad üò¢
Dad had a heart attack, but he'd been in a fight. Unfortunate circumstances. 
"Surely you mean ""living alone"" and not that the woman deserves death for being too old to care for herself. "

I assume his midichlorian count must be high.
Err. Lol, I guess.
I‚Äôm baked and the fact that you updated yourself is extremely satisfying to me so thanks for that.
You have mental problems dude. Get off the internet and get a life.
[NAME] damn you are autistic
This is the first I‚Äôm hearing of this. Not on any of the local news, but on Reddit! MASSIVE media bias.
im sorry for your loss. your aunts behavior is disgusting. dont give her anything.
and now her mask is on. make up yer mind
who doesn‚Äôt know what an Ethernet port looks like lmao
Ok, we get it. You're a top.
Mmmm squeeze dat cheek
Wait so you can get an acre of rainforest for $35? I mean, it would be way cheaper at that volume but still that's real cheap
But he's relieving pressure. Just count yourself lucky he doesn't cough when he farts.
thats why she is going crazy lmao
Oh we‚Äôre TANKING tanking
I did not realize that and maybe it‚Äôs because [NAME] is slightly cheaper and wanted to be a [NAME] badly.
Lol nah i‚Äôm not playing your game dude. Have a good night
Do you want a good time or an **incredibilis** time?
Oh nooooooo! Well, hair will always grow back. And you can get by with bobby pins in the meantime. 
I laughed in my beard.
Wow. What is wrong with you
"Upset? Edit. I didn't notice anybody bring it up but I hope it isn't rude to describe [NAME] being ""Yandere""."
Honestly wish [NAME] would just stop taking threes all together. They just don‚Äôt fall for him.
Unless they‚Äôre narcissistic. Then gray rock the hell out of them and good luck!
It shouldn't surprise you, since you're here. 
You‚Äôre not wrong. The post is mostly a joke ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ahh, I see. Well, he wasn't wrong!
Okay, so that doesn‚Äôt really answer my question. Are you suggesting the liability will fall on the towing company with shitty or sketchy reviews? 
You just made my point, you obnoxious whining kid
4th qrt over 10.5 looks reasonable, play-offs teams usually try the hardest at the 4th
In this regard, how are babies different from neighbors?
[NAME], thank you, for being a friend.
[NAME] gotta fix his free throws this is ridiculous
It was at that moment she decided to go back to college.
Oh well, you can thank all the illegals coming into America illegally for that one. 
6'3 guy who wants to be the smaller guy here, [NAME] i feel you
Funny joke.
- me when I‚Äôm definitely not fine but too embarrassed to admit it
This guy was my high school government teacher. This stuff is all classic to read about
lol, suit yourself.
Depends on what's causing the hallucinations
There's nothing strange about a lawyer with a neo-Nazi client, but a lawyer who takes on multiple neo-Nazi clients makes me suspicious
I was about to reach out to mine - this situation is nearly the same and your post just saved me from a huge mistake! Thank you
Was it? Honestly I didnt get it, even asked some other people and they didnt get. I guess color me ignorant. Care to explain? 
Can you snap a picture of that pinky in your butthole, friend? 
The world needs a lil crazy
My face is so round so I don‚Äôt even know what male haircut to get :(
You were really fortunate! See, that‚Äôs what I imagined would happen... 
Have fun toasting expired marshmallows in hell, lady-killer POS.
She even looks like a trigglypuff.
If you want to know what kind of people her parents are you can google her. He name is [NAME]
Has anyone else noticed when [NAME] is ‚Äòcrying‚Äô there are no tears.
Yeah i don't want them to know to early it ruins the fun.
thanks, I agree
Just be a criminal if that's what they want. People should always be careful what they wish for.
oh shitttt. it‚Äôs upside down
There's also the possibility of mold growing between the skin flaps. That's why some very pbese people can smell like rotting cloth.
Yeah right like they always talk about themselves why can‚Äôt I gets me so pissed off
What a waste of plastic.
Bringing it up now because you and many like you made this sub a hostile environment for voices of reason. Eat crow.
Sorry you don't understand the basic thrust of socialism.
They very clearly state no new accounts can post. Yours is 2 weeks old and low karma.
"Lol OK. I guess we'll skip over the ""generally accepted"" part of the definition cuz why not, eh?"
I can be convinced to like any trade right now but it all comes down to the return.
Well, don't kill spiders. That's what you get. Be nice and take them outside. It's not that hard.
Is there much of a population? I wanted to play it back in The day and then they changed it into an almost entirely new game.
Wait.... What??!
Am I the only one who can't get the sound to work?
Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.
THROW OUT BOYLEN
Thank you. [NAME]
Bank of x .co .uk
Hmmmmm that is interesting. I wonder why you were told different. I think I'm going to email support and ask.
Nah, they always were a government's tool to enslave us
mirotic is beal now?
Only good commie is a dead one.
Oh you just love to see that
Yeah I wasn't sure if he was surprised or appalled the ever good and heroic [NAME] would go to that solution
Yeah. I'm gonna take a shower
Right on. Hi from saskatoon canada. Take care buddy
*looks at YouTube comments sections* Um. I'm not so sure.
That‚Äôs fair, I disagree with you, but I‚Äôm not here to change your mind. Was just curious. 
That‚Äôs been arguably his strongest attribute this season?
My introvert ass who wants someone to cuddle but needs to recharge after 5mins of social interaction
Dude got his helmet off and was on his feet quicker than the camera guy could catch his reaction, adrenaline and shock are a hell of a drug..
Oh, definitely [NAME]. 
thanks <3
Damn *fabulous*!
A few times but people like this have a short attention span/only care when the tv says too
We are fighting for their autonomy, which is why we're fighting hard for them to be born first.
You look like [NAME] fucked [NAME]
Interesting. My AP is probably more my opposite than my SO.
[NAME] back with the Goal Post love.
No, [NAME] has said more than once it was not. 
[NAME], that is so horrible. I‚Äôm so sorry for you and OP.
Sorry, I should have clarified that I meant when they determine your eligibility/payments in regards to the Repayment Assistance Program.
Thanks! Here's hoping silly comic book shows don't trigger you in 2019!
[NAME] after he declares he loves playing Fortnite, wants to play with his brother no matter what and loves Vancouver. 
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen solely because of UA, however that‚Äôll surely be cool if it does happen
Didn't even get a chuckle out of me. I guess its just too high brow for my dumb brain.
The game will come out for the switch this year. Was wondering how they would manage the combat system. Now I know.
I want to get rough with him. Choking, tying me up, light BDSM.
U can try. Maybe say u are busy now Thursday but Friday is still open. I mean u are not waiting for her forever right?
It's a miracle! This is how religions start.
And that still doesn‚Äôt change my speculation. Cops could have gotten it wrong on the front end when getting the warrant
Oh that's right they just came back from the vacation. This is a vacation business trip. What a fuckin' joke.
"If you have to ask ""how to know if I'm ready for psychedelics"" then you are clearly not ready."
Puddle... More like pothole. Ironic it looks like NJ
That looks like a fun group
*How???* The internet never ceases to amaze me.
Everybody just standing around.
The mango pods I purchased in New Zealand gave me a crazy headache but other flavours did not.
no it doesn't, hmmmm I sent in an ask on the discord support page about finding people so lemme check that
[NAME] in the trash that's just how I like it good list
It would be funny if that guy got hit with a car at the end tho.
"""In Scotland, the word 'fuckin'' is just a warning that a noun is on the way"" -[NAME]"

No, sadly it was from a different person, thankfully not the original poster though.
it really do be like that sometimes
ü¶ÄMY BABYS DEADü¶Ä
And we play for 6 dollars, this makes me so angry we need a big ass casino in that game
Arguably. It is undefined.
Im surprised those ebrats who tried to steal your step daughter's board didn't complain to the mom about it.
Which doesn't fit with the fact that they built massive bathrooms during the construction of Hogwarts.
Please, please, please get help. 
No amnesiac was my friend.
yeah it was awesome!
I find that kind of thing really funny too!
Is it really beneficial to link egregiously misleading articles? Ah Huffpost, Buzzfeed, Breitbart, Fox News etc‚Äîthe pillars of journalism. 
Everyone‚Äôs gotta face the music some day brother
I didn't realise this was happening! Thank you! It was hard to tell from OPs photo what the changes were
[NAME] THAT HURTS DON'T DO THAT
PAC man looks too fast
That brilliant and so true!!!
In what ways?
[NAME] doesn‚Äôt use it & had the highest SAUG k/d at Vegas. Definitely isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpoop‚Äù without it lol.
Pick #35 overall at the most. Even a 1st-round swap is too much IMO.
But the satisfaction of getting a headshot is better with the USP.
‚ÄúI was half a virgin when I met him!‚Äù ‚Äî[NAME]
The ND vs Georgia game in Athens will be a good one.
He might be bummed but if I could play anywhere other than Toronto my next choice would 100% be LA.
That's pretty gross. Unlucky OP.
Unbelievable that we didn‚Äôt sign him Also, we could‚Äôve potentially signed [NAME] the window we signed [NAME]. Kill me.
Probably didn't notice the bicycles until last second and swerved to avoid them.
Like, [NAME]?
Holy shit this speaks to me.
Thank you so much . I'm really really really nervous.. I just want to cry.
I never even knew there were bullies in school unit I was out of school and read about bullies in school.
Yea I would've lost it there
The conversion go muscle probably helped, considering the size of them. I'm super happy for you dude, you've done amazingly!
Nothing matters. The world was burning when you came in to it and it will be burning when you leave it.
Well tell me what happened then
You know he humps the hell out of that thing right? Like probably right in [NAME] mouth!
What a great photo and you two look so happy. üòç
Let's be completely honest though it kinda doesn't
I <3 you!
From 1900:
"That whole [NAME] bit of ""I'm not gonna rape you. I'm a little boy."" is oddly on target."
Don‚Äôt be ashamed of what you like. You have a good day, fellow redditor. 
Nihilism makes me happy, but I know that‚Äôs just my opinion.
I only watch bad animes sorry
Thank you. It's great that I can come here and have lovely people like you help me to not feel so alone.
Yes, and they hire trade school graduates at much lower salaries. A University graduate is usually better rounded and more competant.
would you kiss a girl if you're drunk tho? Edit : why the downvotes? It's just a question, geez
Praise [NAME] your taste is bad /s
I've seen this one, but don't remember the source. Any help?
But now we're stressed out.
The Mason jar can be clean, if you'd prefer

Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
Damn I didn't realize we just locked up the season series against the jets. That's good to see.

Thanks, I think you're right.

I was a little pissed off until I watched this loop 6 times. Now I'm happy! Weee!
It's crazy I don't get where their finding them
I hated [NAME], but only because I thought he was good and played for the Cowboys. I feel the same way about [NAME] and [NAME]. 
The frankness of this comment made me giggle
More like the in-law that nobody likes.

Dawg, turn on the volume and smash that screen record button. too easy.
I love the post you just made! Well written and very relatable.
I didn‚Äôt realize people cared so much about phones.
Apologies, got a little carried away. 
I know the feeling

Is it just me, or do these children look really uncomfortable around the Duggars? The smiles look forced...
Yep, lack of proper coaching yet again. Sucks we missed out on [NAME]. 
I agree. I‚Äôd rather spend $500 a ticket to go to MetLife and watch it on the big screen with 75,000 other Jets fans.
I call bullshit on this anon said they were ‚Äúwalking‚Äù ... you know they were in the scooter cart.
Me too. I love it!

Someone else said that, I never examined it that closely because I was too busy having a good laugh lol.

Probably an old dude.
Thanks for your opinion. It's highly respected lol
I'm sorry for your loss
Thanks [NAME] for holding on to our $17.5M. We will be needing that back though.

oh I thought you were calling OP loser my bad
That's a lot of calories!
Observe the troll in its natural habitat! Majestic and elegant. Again and again it calls out its mating call:
"SAY IT AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. why do people constantly call things that aren't macaroni ""macaroni""."
Excellent work thank you for this. This is why I love Reddit.
Thanks for the kind words but some things are in fact permanent. Still I appreciate your reply. Thank you.
What a deliciously glorious rant. I suspect he is not alone in his opinions.
No it‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs much easier to pull in to the space and leave it there.
Interesting note about the QR codes. I've almost never used them myself. I tend to just copy and paste an address.
That was your saddest shortest story yet
I agree with this post times a billion and also: Save [NAME]! Love the name. Huge Fight Club fan.
The fuck you call me!? A cunt!? Damn man, didn‚Äôt know I meant so much to you, right in the feels.
Are you poly, or just poly for him?
[NAME] doesn't do nihilism. She's war ravaged. Ergo she has to recover.
The inevitable divorce is probably going to cost him more than a new ring
It‚Äôs my birthday too! I‚Äôve always love it!
:( im sorry
Yeah I meant it has a cork in it. Sorry for the confusion haha
Just heard on the news that it‚Äôs reopening now. I‚Äôm assuming it was a little electrical fire so they evacuated everyone as a precaution
That is NOT a firecracker..

The 30 second new's watcher is still in a far better place to judge *their own interests* better than you or anyone else.
I don't know how I feel about this. There's the story going around that [NAME] turned into a diva once he got paid.
Now this is poke choking!
They‚Äôre more and more surprised every week when this is reposted.
Will do tonight!
He loves it.
Aww, try mindfulness. I think I am going over to that sub now.
Interesting!!
Probably the same thing the rest of us do, chuckle and ponder how it can get any worse üòÇ

Loved that damn [NAME]
"""drop the beat *AYYYYYYYYY........OOOOOOOOHHHHNNNOOOOOO""*"
Mine did too
Maybe even prettier!
Beak makes no sense. Well beaks make no sense anyway but this one especially
Choking/strangulation is one of the strongest predictors of more severe future violence. Absolutely press charges and take whatever other steps you need to be safe.

The [NAME] make beers? That's news to me
I loveeeeee Perth!!!! Why isn‚Äôt anyone else gushing about this town?

I just hope [NAME] isn't pulling the wagon. Would hate for her to throw up.
Why would he get upset? Your husband was the one who went to PreCana classes and knows that using contraception is a means for annulment.
I resent being lumped in with the group you are referencing, but thanks for sharing.
I've always found it weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
Yikes!! This rebuild year isn't fun
I have a wery gweat frwiend in Wome, you know. 
And I thought Honda Civics smell bad on the outside!
And that is what cognitive dissonance looks like. People do the craziest things when reality doesn't meet their expectations.
Np just passing it forward from another comment haha. Love the sudden silence in this video. Love the look on everyone‚Äôs faces.
They dont build up unless you get points though do they?
Just gonna be mean here, those are all hideous :(
Since 1987 it has been like this, I love this team and this sport.
Thank you so much! ‚ô•Ô∏è
What are you on sir
Leave *my* sleep schedule alone, jackass. You‚Äôre the one that wants to change the status quo we‚Äôve had for decades.
They do not believe in the NAP nor do they believe in property. Although [NAME] would balk at being associated with [NAME]
Are you sure? He's a rarity if he has never taken up the habit.
Just typed out my comment and then I saw this. Yup, exactly.
you are pathetic.
It seems to be his Twitter reactions really. He prob needs to spend less time there
I can easily relate to that as well. The siblings are the ones who will stick with us for the whole journey to the very end.
Eat the damn rich already!
[NAME] is such a pretty lady. I'm jealous of those huge eyes!
screenings only at disney land / world, no stream or disk releases. that could work.
No problem at all! If you ever want to talk to some internet random again, feel free to talk to me.
[NAME] was awful last season. Let's sign [NAME] instead.
I've been playing this game since release and didn't even know that!
Only had 1 line to worry about and they did all the damage
Thank you. It happened suddenly. Near the end of the game.
[NAME] was not childfree. He just honored his wife's (who is childfree) desires because he loved her.
Yeah... major design flaw.
They had that coming
My mom goes through a 12 pack a day. That‚Äôs an alcoholic.
No, he was hecka hungry and coming down to McDonald‚Äôs would mean being caught.
‚ÄòMy Goddess went to prison and all I got was this crappy t-shirt‚Äô
I DESERVE TO BE HEAD OF NATIONAL SECURITY BECAUSE I'M ADOPTED
Please list them and sources as well. Thanks.

She looks so corrupt... Same with [NAME]

Thank you for writing this, for letting us into your world so that we can better understand our own. I am very grateful for this gift.
I will watch tonight, thank you!
I just mentioned it to another poster but we have reached Poe's Law where I actually don't know if they are being satirical or not.
I love this. Kids just live in the moment which makes them so unaware of so many things.
**IITT'SSSS HIGHHHHH NOOOOOOOONNN**
Sack, shaft, and tip. The trifecta. 
MeToo is about sharing personal stories of sexual assault. Reframing it as accusation based, and as furthering a kidnap, is fucking disgusting.
I will try to pay better attention. Its definatly not just ambient noise. I think you might be on to something with the packages.
Maybe we‚Äôre on a secret real life version of Dinner for Schmucks?
[NAME] - Truck Union | Official Music Video
It inhales you ignorant octorok
He's likeable but the pace of a game on live tv is too much for him. He'd definitely be better suited as a halftime guy
Also technically wrong, it would be last year but not a year ago.
I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
I have [NAME] hat so I could marry it, flip it and kill it
If if just didn't have the punchline poisoning title...
Former Mexican president was taking bribes from drug traffickers we need the wall
if you logged in that complicates things... i honestly still doubt they would really go after you, but technically they could if they wanted to.
hahahaha!! the seedy underbelly of the competitve choir world - exposed!!
I went to a different one just outside Beijing and they said they had to turn off their panels because old people were falling or having heart attacks :O
Idk. She is trying to get a new lawyer because the last one did nothing to help her.
Why would we sign [NAME] when we already have a full time shortstop and third baseman?
I don't get it. Maybe i need to position myself better to get dibs on batches. I literally have only made $60 a week.
No, she's standing in the water after she pees.
Is it too late?
Friend: hey, did you watch the Superbowl? Me: I don't really follow golf.
This looks like [NAME] at the gym
LCSC?
thanks heaps it actually did help [NAME] good man, saved
To Be Continued dot mp4
Np good luck!!
She has pretty hair.
Welp, can't see [NAME] beating [NAME] if she's in this form!
Drive safely now.
Thank you, love. You too! ‚ù§ It's nice to find kindred spirits.
You see that's why you don't give tuna and catnip to the neighborhood cats because then they'll never leave.
Anyone link r/causalchildabuse yet? No? Allow me. r/causalchildabuse
Completely understandable. Maybe mom should book flights a little bit farther in advance next time though!
I knew there is always an Orochi, even in a [NAME] vs [NAME] duel. Hiding, waiting...
"!remindme 4 days ""Stupid Entitled Parent, sunglasses"""
I like how you ignored the point about Blade Runner.
Lol i control your life gooferton btw open your chatbox
Photo taken by myself today in a subway car in Bucharest.
Ah ok I thought by terrific you mean terrific at reducing speeding since (I think) that is the policy objective. Cheers!
Weird, no formatting was applied. I changed to text
Thanks. I‚Äôm not ok with the behavior I‚Äôm.just having a difficult time accepting what I must do.
Having fewer friends means having deeper friendships in many cases. I can tell when someone isn't my real friend.
thank you, i dont get whats so hard to come to such an easy solution honestly
I am from central pennsylvania and moved to AZ. Phoenix definitely has the nicest expressways in the country.
Do you people just sit in meme economy and wait for something new to come up?
Sorry, not sorry'.
I'm pretty sure [NAME] is the single most reported character in the game.
The NHL has the best All-Star events. the 3v3 tournament is so fun to watch.
I blame all of y'all, y'all told [him he] was funny
The best losers of grand finals cod has ever seen
Damn don‚Äôt sell this
"The last Pope that did that ""stepped"" down and was replaced."
I'm painfully aware of that having bought a FreeSync monitor with my Nvidia graphics card.
It's probably easier when they're stuck on an island
Now that‚Äôs impressive. Our fuzz understands what the knob does, but he can‚Äôt turn it.
Very good points. Thank you for sharing that!
He may be embarrassed about the condition of their house.
I'd love me some JVG, but not that [NAME] freak [NAME]...
He also probably hasn't finished school but has seen like, all the [NAME] lectures so he totally already know everything.
Current use could also mean setting pills in a weekly pill box for use each day.
This artwork is amazing! Only thing that bothers me a bit, is that [NAME] is wearing something that looks like Korean traditional wear as opposed to a kimono
Isn't this kind of what America is all about
Those didn't produce any relevant examples.
Last year was Celtics and Sixers... that‚Äôs pretty decent
The Imperial is the best gay bar in Sydney. PERIOD.
Dude, you forgot the dozen donuts!
Oh that's it yes
Oh well, okay, it worked!
That's what I heard coming into this game, people were saying if they don't handle gobert, game over
Sometimes people that are around each other a lot just get to be friends. Sometimes people ignore that their friends are actually terrible people.
Where can you watch community? I can‚Äôt find it anywhere and it looks great.
It's about 20 years. They let me out early because of good behavior.
Uncle doods is awesome.
This is amazing news for the Giants. If either of these guys are available at 6 they should literally sprint to the podium.
I do this but but feel better in the end because I use it for procrastination. It's a weird combinational to feel better and worse while cleaning.
Forget it [NAME], it's Chirotown. 
Actually the chat is fairly centrist and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with having English as your second language
Thanks. Screw the cancellation rate, it‚Äôs worth denying <4.7. Good to know!
Read culture of critique next
I thought it was his nose sliced off, got confused when I didnt see any blood
NOW WE ARE READY TO SAIL FOR THE HORN, WEIGH HEY AND OFF WE GO
But they aren't poisonous?
I'll Google it, thanks again!
Boys lets go start a donnybrook
He‚Äôs not the character you‚Äôre looking for.
Oh... I read that the fedora made her sweaty... I can't imagine head wear making someone moist. But hey, there's something for everyone.
Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard
That is patently false, considering his history of driving multiple businesses into the ground.
I tell myself that but when I‚Äôm at 90 I‚Äôm like a zombie
Thanks for laugh, I needed that. 
11 years goddamit I‚Äôm old
Maybe they actually went to help the guy who fell instead of just filming?
Kinda ageist to assume she was only working because she needed money...
I like the fact that you like it a lot.
Turgeon offense at it's finest. The ball never gets past the three point line and [NAME] just hits a three in someone's face.
Oh jeez, just took back my upvote I gave this photo. Thanks for telling us, that's extremely messed up
Now they say [NAME] is [NAME]? Smh my head
Looks like a pretty good plate overall!!
Eh happiness is just a fleeting fish in an ocean of emotion. You can catch it a few times but dont expect to live off it.
But why does your horse have a leash on her while eating. Looks sooo uncomfy. Poor bubby!!!
Did you miss the massive throbbing erection the Dems had over the no fly no buy thing?
Go to the police. Get a restraining order. That is not okay.
Oh got it
Youtube is my Wikipedia. Videos about any interest. But I read Wikipedia sometimes too when I want to know the details.
i appreciate the consistency of your values.
Shoes in flesh-matching nude are as bad as leggings in flesh-matching nude
Oh no you guys, I think I just Shattenkirked in my pants
I'm not saying she should get surgery, but I gotta ask, would laser lipo or something similar get her to the body shape she wants?
> super model strange Oh man
‚Äú nice try‚Äù
my good girl
Of course I love myself because I'm awesome.
Sad but exciting to see him in a place where he might perform well. Hopefully he stays injury free.
I know but it just sucks to feel like this
Should have sold him some underwear and told him wearing it would power his phone.
I was in Korea in July and August, it's hot as humid hell. Spring and autumn are better.
[NAME] I miss [NAME]. Still is and always will be of my favorite players.
NEVER RUNNING FROM A REAL FIGHT!
My score per minute is terrible because I only snipe so asking the wrong person. Sorry dude
I love this! And I find myself thinking the exact same things. Soon...
I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.
Really? I live down the street from there, thanks!!!
"I sure as sugarplums aint seen any ""gives"" around "
Exactly. Its serious, but not serious enough for the NFL. And for the list i made, those People still play in the NFL after suspensions. 
I‚Äôm in my second year. Still closeted. Still uncomfortable with my body and sexuality. Still socially awkward.
I love almost everything Ethiopian but by [NAME] is Ethiopian music hard to listen to
The emoji at the end just made me want to slap her
Just be respectful.
[NAME] got some baby making to do, needs the break
1. Left tiddy 2. Right tiddy
could you go a bit further on the unethical journalist practices that occurred?
Wear some cool shades in your pics and play up your good qualities in your bio. If you‚Äôre funny and/or confident, really own it.
I have been really close friends with her for over a year so I don't think that is the problem. I appreciate the comment though thank you.
Because I am stressed out and need to take my mind away from the source of stress. That's how my brain tricks me into it.
I believe I have just sent you an invite
Not only was it PI, it was also a hit to the head. You‚Äôre 0/2.
You‚Äôll just be throwing them up. Ain‚Äôt worth it.
Thanks, you are right, I appreciate you reaching out
RemindMe! 6 months
Well that just means that red hair isn't a valid hair color, just a mutation. We should just count them as brown instead. /heavysarcasm
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop vibrating!‚Äù [NAME]: ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)
They‚Äôre both in Austin..I don‚Äôt see [NAME] being someone to hang out with [NAME] more than the other way around.
I would love it if they could, but I don't think his trade value is that high
Imagine living your daily life with a mummy leg.
I think you grossly overestimate how many former felons will bother voting anyway, and grossly underestimate how conservative hispanics ([NAME] in particular) are in Florida.
Then we shall duel for it. *Good Fight!*
You guys are a problem.
Oh hell no. Shes blind!!! No way in HELL is she ever being left alone with it.
People like you are why I follow this sub. Keep it up I need more laughs like that!
this guy is such a douchebag
A tshirt. I actually bought the cutest shirt that has a nasa logo on it and it says I just need some space. I love it.
I legit wish you never talked to me
Am I the only one who really wants to know exactly what shit went down between them??
> it should be clear to an decent and mentally apt person which side is obviously the worst That's a rather centrist opinion you hold there buddy /s
"""Welcome to the hydraulic press channel.."""
I appreciate this reference very much
Dude, I can't express in words how much relief this man brings to my soul.
At least I have a source champ.
Good thing they were all about to jump when it happened. Do you know what happened to the pilots?
So I heard. How is she, haven't seen her in a while.
That's kind of the problem innit? The only solution is for everyone to do something that we all damn well know everyone isn't going to do.
You can get into big, fuck up your life forever trouble.
Doesn't mean it won't work for some
could you mark this nsfw or something I didn‚Äôt want to see that :(
This is hilarious if you read it in [NAME] voice
Can I stay with you if I fly down next season?
Yes! He‚Äôs back LOOCH!
What will I have for dinner?
The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.
I wanna win this game so bad FJB
Can you guys take the last half? We'll take the 6-2 start, SC gets the 1-7 finish?
Weird, Tuxedo Mask looks shorter and pudgier than I pictured him to be
"Lol so you're too stupid to know how to argue, and stupid enough to actually use ""lol"" in a post?"
I miss old [NAME]
I miss candlestick :(
Congrats to your wife and you! Hope everything goes well!
I can't see a way forward, neither the government or the opposition wants no-deal or to cancel A50. 
I cant even get my spouse to share the same bed...fml
Nobody does that!
What does that even mean?
And yet it looks like one thing you can't is read. Shame shame.
Thanks for the reply. Why'd you delete the sad sack comment?
Mmmm....bacon point
Watched this while eating hash browns covered in ketchup. You SOB. NSFW lol.
A fork and spoon could be a fapoon?
We're one in the same!!!!!!!!!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
What‚Äôs a leppo?
She seems like such a happy kid too!
Mmm ... Chicken milk.
Really? Edit: Ah yea, I saw the original one. It still reminds me of Wind Maker.
The obsession with a plot.
Ouch! That hit hard
On hamsters. You forgot the hamsters.
That'll do, pig.

It's been deleted, we can't even see what it was now (unfortunately). 
I hope so, she could bring an interesting dynamic between [NAME] and [NAME].
I like the high ground suggestion. Thanks
I will admit,I did chuckle a bit
Nah I choked on my food
Duck fuck goose
Hello everyone. Im from Toronto as well. Can call and visit in personal if needed.
Dilly dilly!
He was off by 5 minutes, not impressed. 
This. Our new grad orientation was basically us being checked off on all the skills we learned during nursing school.
The fact [NAME] met her at the airport should tell you all you need to know about why they did it. What a farce.
Lol nah fam coal is the future stop the war on coal!!!!!! /s
For serial rapists, its not about the physical pleasure. Its all head games. Damn freaks
Looks like your hormones are not working properly.
i think that's more 10 years old rather than year 10 :)
I'm scared to do these cuz the S.A.G.E. told me I was a transvestite
That‚Äôs good but why would you waste your time on a crappy team?
Loving the circle-jeck hate, how about not getting so triggered by other people taking offense at an ad
Pretty sure that had been upped to at least 10k subs. It actually might even be higher now.
I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
PUT THEIR BLINDFOLDS BACK ON!!!
Equally, or better - local example: greedy [NAME]. You just know that if his company was adept at tax avoidance, he does the same.
I dont own a gun. I just dont like your attitude. You read like a drugged out washed up leach.
And it‚Äôs not even a close shave either. Must be very tender. Poor guy...
you‚Äôre acting mad pretentious lol there‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to live in Cali
Yeah, sorry about that. I see it in so many post I thought it was almost a custom to do so.
No, you're supposed to get angry and yell that you're right when someone corrects you
Are you assuming that all of [NAME] friends are mutual friends of whoever took this screenshot?
"*""Success is the best revenge.""* Good job OP. Stay strong. You're almost there."
Confirmed that men are literally soulless, it's a matter until they start eating humans
Whatever dude dong worry about it... it‚Äôll get handled
Oohhooo that's cold (& very good!)! ü§£
are delicious mass produced perogies.
> , believe me. 
You did. But I‚Äôm not arguing with a bunch of troglodytes. Have a nice day.
My worry is that campaign financing is complex enough that they'll be able to be sneaky about it while maintaining a good public face.
"[NAME] was caught stealing his neighbors newspapers. He pockets all the money that is given to him and he does not use it effectively. [NAME] sad ""life"""
25000 likes wow! I got max. 30-35 likes.
Wait what‚Äôs wrong with [NAME] lol I‚Äôve never had any problems listening to him personally
Yep. The problem is definitely regulation and not wealth hoarding supported by corporate money controlling politics. Temporarily embarrassed millionaires unite!
Interesting my bodies blurry but I wanna dtW that
Didn't look that thick either...no snow....this was ending badly no matter what.
2 losses to 1 loss, hmmmm seems we should be above them 
The Young turds are especially bad and they‚Äôre not even sly about it either.
so, when and how do we pull a lando and turn on vader?

Fake smile always gives dopamine/happiness to deal with stress
He's both. An edgy neckbeard skinny fat, but he is undeniably funny. 
Two recent
A dangerous and oppressive social construct.
That really is all they have. He‚Äôll just keep asking questions in bad faith to continue getting your attention.
Are you special? The game came out long after the school year began.
I would not feed her anything that would cause extra butt wiping. No effing burrito!
That's already a few steps ahead of many people.
thanks <3 *hugs*
The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I‚Äôm so sorry.
[NAME] and [NAME] had equally good chances when they were on the same line in the first/second period - they just didn't convert.
It's called a fullstop in England. My fucking immersion in this meme is ruined.
So hard to believe that this comment isn`t being ridiculed. I want some of what you guys are smoking.
Oh okay. I thought maybe I missed something in MaM2.
Dipo always be in our hearts. The one that got away
I find this super relateable, I had no idea others felt the same way. 
Ah, the word alluded me.
Only time will tell :P
He posted about white racists on a post that has nothing to do about racism. Pretty sure he is just racist.
Sorry, i actually lied, they thought it was 
I peed off my deck at -30 yesterday, very disappointed when it didn‚Äôt freeze before impact.
no, mostly just spurred from mild boredom and thinking of the [NAME] future. Getting a gauge at the caliber of players chosen at #12.
This is the best creepy pasta I have **EVER** read.
I watched a really bad horror movie she starred in but I think it predated VPR.
Just shut up dude
Prove what point? That you don‚Äôt know how to read? I‚Äôm confused.
You‚Äôre thinking too technically about it. All politicians should be threatened with life in prison or execution if they go back on the word.
[NAME] Wednesday‚Äôs üòé Good to know he‚Äôs enjoying the retirement life. 
We should stop there... the inception will sink the titanic.
IT'S MA'AM!!!

Wow, the menacing head shake...(shivers) 
Praying for me family.
When my [NAME] is crying...
I hate when I get extremely bored doing something that was once all consuming.
I love how you're making an assumption to try and make a point.
Thank you so much! I'm documenting as much as I can!
So it's like the first game then? The only thing they took out was the fully-destructible environment? Did they do anything else?
I agree. This is assault. Leave the ignorant hill [NAME] alone.
Oh dang I hadn‚Äôt even looked at her face!
a surprise to be sure
Everything's broken then. It's not like all other discourse is high minded and unemotional.
Even for an infidelity sub this is heavy. I hope you find peace somehow.
>ctrl + F > fuck your mother I am not disappointed.
This is a wholesome confession lol
What kind of insider only has 250 followers?
Loved this video so much! [NAME] is my favorite and her pups crack me up!
Thank you so much.
Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick
i also cried
You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
See my previous post, I put them there! :)
Imagine being that much of a useless parasite
[NAME] and [NAME] at a brothel together > [NAME] and [NAME] at the Laver Cup

Oh, it‚Äôs you again. Here: 
It will be interesting if there is a response to that at the federal level.
I honestly can't tell if he really doesn't care or if he's just soft af... or maybe both lol
The latter is correct.
World politics you ARE the media
Poetic justice they get to the title game host Philly and BDN whips it out for them and shoves it down their throat. That would be epic.
Life Hack Attack has become Attack Everyone's Life and Hack. I love it.
Wait but [NAME] did make the game without listening to these morons
I hate how much I love it
Damn you [NAME]!
Im gonna ride a shark to work.
Ho. [NAME]. Shit. Glad you made it through that insanity
Depends how big it is. This print probably took at about an hour and 15 mins. 2 hours at most.
Get [NAME] streaky ass tf off this team.
Not available in my country. Can't believe this has to be a thing in the modern age.
Works perfect for me. I play Melee, F Zero, Kirby Air Ride, Mario Sunshine and they all look great with no noticable lag.
No another person lol.
These are some of the best movies to watch high (esp Butterfly Effect)
Actually there are some terminals now that let you disable it lmao. Very sad.
Huskies are better than Malamutes fight me [NAME]
"And the shit like ""like for [NAME], Ignore for satan"""
Yeah, not having a system that treats a kid that can't read as an emergency is a problem. 
Fair enough. The cake is definitely too much haha
Did you make him finish the meal before he got the toy?
She actually does that, because she sees that you are happy, but the person behind you really needed that :P
Shit's going down in Zim. 6 people killed yesterday by army and over 200 arrested.

Yes but iy also makes complete sense that morty woild want it gone too, so i hate how he instantly assumes it was rick
Someone has never seen a flop before
Your shoes are all half a size too big.

The photos are haunting
Then [NAME] took little Donnie Two Scoops out to get a happy meal because he's been such a good top businessman!
Hm, my info may be out of date. It would be cool to see them manage good mobile support for MTG!
And [NAME], would again like to apologize for any misunderstanding.
"It's 2019 and people are *still* saying ""SJW's?"" Ha! Hahahahaha! Oh my life. [NAME]."
Aye the party left me. Now I'm stuck in with this old boys tadger staring me in the face.
No problem. Glad you were able to take something away from that.
I'm so delighted that my boyfriend has found this community.
That got rid of an unwanted boner real quick
Lmao that guy is awesome. You know he probably just found his new hobby.
Omg ur like soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo quirky!
About as much say so as the Walmart employee that stocks the shelves.
That's pretty cool. My friends older brother played against him. We all played for Cherokee. Said he was an awesome pitcher.
im glad to hear that i won't just be carted off! and thanks, it's great to know that you guys have my back :)
Hell yes!
Ooh, [NAME] not happy.
I love [NAME] so much
Woo hoo!
I love this guy.
Are we sure this isn't the beaverton?
That's cute, pizza*kitchen*! No, we call her Kitten to annoy her. :) 
Every right requires someone else's labor. The whole - / + rights thing is a stupid argument.
We need to do something about [NAME] because he's fucking my fantasy team up
Did no one else notice your stroke?
Great. I guess they learned from previous shutdowns.
[NAME] became president and yet you think [NAME] becoming president is farfetched? Lol
I swear to [NAME], these offseason dream/hypothetical lineups get me rock solid every single time. I love it

The Tommy Gun as a crate weapon! Just the worst feeling.
It means that people can be unhappy for being misunderstood. Under any circumstance.
Thank you! Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself otherwise you'll ended up in your late 30s exhausted and unhappy!
I laughed.
Plot twist: she didn‚Äôt turn on any water, just pissed in their hands 
Seems like it was supposed to be funny.
That‚Äôs not the vaccines fault champ.....
I prefer to use a welding torch. I like the ozone and ultraviolet clean feeling and smells. Never have to wash the sheets either.
You're telling me you don't get excited when you see a big hit or players drop the gloves?
Manipulation of a persons enviorment while denying they are doing it in order to make the victim appear crazy.
Here in Russia, we do not like when our culture is misrepresented, but we make fun of such misrepresentations.
Congrats, proud of you ! Hopefully I can follow your lead and get myself out of a similar situation 
Wow...is that true? I‚Äôd love to see more on that. Can you provide any links or documents on that?
so painful to watch
What about [NAME] arm ?Is [NAME] replacing [NAME] cannon ? I was more bummed about losing [NAME] arm than his bat .
Breast? Ah, I like it.
[NAME] how is [NAME] even a rapper. I thought rappers were people you would wanna be lol
Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
Waiting to see if a card expansion will make the game fun.
Having money and a job aren‚Äôt the only determining factors for success.
fuck lacy evens, she has not been impressive at all
The life of a bus driver is harsh.
I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
Did she do it yet? I refuse to look.

[NAME] stated that Ethtrader polls will be used for important community decisions. So I can see people trying to buy influence through Donuts in these decisions.
During your explanation, you didn't make a mention of saying no or trying to stop him. Did you?

Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.

You guys rock!
Man, this analogy is frighteningly spot on. Makes me sad for the province.

It is possible to be a shitbag and also suffer the unfair competition of organized conglomerates of shitbags. Besides, OP wasn't referring to all independent farmers.

They‚Äôre well on track to getting that superpower by 2020 slot
I know they had an extremely toxic relationship but [NAME] was so much more tolerable when he was with [NAME].
Everyday, always, I am a hero inside my head
lol dont worry im aware, just thought it fit more here is all
Would you please link the thread about what cheaters think when they leave the marriage.
Sorry I am foreign, and might have come across wrong. Anyways it has to happen at some stage?
In the wild, it‚Äôs expected that something unexpected will always happen i guess 
Happy birthday!
Idk why youre downvoted, executing a manequin seems fun
Cordovan in the mech with the loudspeaker really makes me smile. It is just so bonkers. I love it.
Yeah. It didn't even work, that's why nobody went crazy. 
Wow, you really missed the point, didn't you?
Oh they should also mount a shelfie stick on the pike wall to capture all the action!
Dragon bender has even more negative value than [NAME] haha. But yeah, they‚Äôd need atlesst a 2nd for [NAME] crossover

I second that motion...with A VENGEANCE!!

We moved away from our home town a few years ago. We have no family and not many close friends.
It‚Äôs definitely winter. My Cornish Rex is in hell right now because she loves laying in windows, but it‚Äôs cold as balls out

I see, good one.

The government is closed right now and nothing is happening at all. When they come back, they might just be pissed enough to let everybody through.
Dude I remember liking [NAME] better. I don't get how kids can have crushes on other kids.
I would also like to know the answer to this. Thanks for posting!
Wow, your posting history is a real... interesting ride.
Catch him in the act. SPIDER-MAN WITH HIS HANDS IN A COOKIE JAR.
[NAME] 31m contract is horrendous, I hated it when he signed it and I hate it now.
A big fat phony!!!
What episode is this. You know, for a friend...
"Don't be pedantic. In this context, I don't think we are meant to take ""biker"" to mean ""motorcycle aficionado."""

I've spent too much of my life being angry at the Jets, just gotta roll with it now.
Okogie looks like a freaking beast compared to the rest, maybe not Ayton. His shoulders are bigger than his head haha.
There are racist morons everywhere.
Or he could just not share your beliefs? I mean, you don‚Äôt think his ethnicity should dictate his political views, do you?
No youre a cunt
‚ÄúLittle dumb‚Äù ugh how awful
That took a turn.
I'd be ok. I rarely wear the stuff..
It was good, but not great.
To be honest having fast food at the White House would be fun
well that's no creepy in the slightest
Hi I'm an order of magnitude more awkward than you and I'm coming.
Hellooo back up career!
You try reposting it?
r/woooosh I guess... xD
55 here. Of course, I could never catch me one of those wonderful incels.
Shut up [NAME] we‚Äôve had enough of experts
Well first I need a girl friend. Multiple personalities are the next step.
[NAME] bringing on Sir [NAME] to confront [NAME] about calling him fat is a great interview
Love this - beautiful penmanship
Nope. And I don't even have a dog.
Are you like a little baby or what. That's nothing in the realm of fetichism.
That's honestly less than I expected.
Looks like Venice to me
Can we somehow use them to collect co2? Or at least stretch them a bit to try?
All women are useless - maybe if you made better choices it would be better for ya
Ha ha good one
I‚Äôd imagine so.
Hates the patriarchy...has an iPhone designed by a man. So hypocrite can be added to the list of bullshit that makes up your personality
Better than that dumb pink look.
I'm not crying... you're crying!
No one is going to create more competition for themselves
giving great [NAME] vibes
Can‚Äôt fault you there
> For the same reason it wouldn‚Äôt permit business with an expressly racist/sexist/etc. business But those practices are illegal at all levels already.
Omg I can't stop giggling lol!
Much appreciated, do you not play often?
Even though you can me, I‚Äôm slow clapping to this!
Hurr durr, put well regulated back in the constitution. Ok [NAME] the fucking [NAME].

Lol religion is a crazy thing
Thank you for commenting exactly what I was going to comment and saving me the trouble!
Check my recent post... make sure you know what you're talking about
Literally everything. What has happened, what is happening, and what will happen, all at once somehow. 
Yes, oops 
thank you so much. i needed this.
We‚Äôve got the terrorists screaming [NAME] while commiting terror acts to thank for that.
Anyone that puts something in their ass/genitals then touches it and then puts their and on their face is gross
Holy hell, that sub is nice.
No one does... that what makes it so provocative.
I absolutely love it that EVERYONE is scoring... please keep this up for the rest of the season.

lol why ? they were both garbage when their time was up
I love your writing style!
What a fresh and unique criticism!
Hard agree it‚Äôs sooo creepy. I hope she‚Äôs ok that man had serial killer written all over him.
Was a great interview! Loved the segment on them asking about [NAME] and if he actually had to go to class haha.
I can tell you thought this damp squib was an absolute dinger.
"""Reasonable"" and ""unreasonable"" have been asigned based on who agrees with you. How egotistical. You are still being childish."
Or you could treat them as regular people and not judge them off their intelligence, then it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem 
Because deceptive practices are easier than producing actual arguments in favor of your position.
I can't pluck it, hurts too much. So every few days I shave a strand of hair on my chin.
That's interesting! Here I am having been saying I grew up near the original all my life. I will correct my story.
Hooray! ...But I'll still never be able to afford a home.
Emotes have a ridiculous amount of effort put into them, which only makes the fact that nobody uses them sadder
judah!!
Now you've told them
All the inmates, including serial killers: *'Someone save me from this psycho.'*
[NAME] will need to pray to The [NAME] dad doesn‚Äôt come down on him with great vengeance.
Needed that. A [NAME] ridiculous play is a game changer
The beauty of the horseshoe effect.
You‚Äôre funny if you think 27 vs 1 is going to somehow end in a good deal for the UK.
that' be dope! Like a bunch of arrows following him like Red Death had bats
Why are we trusting them to do anything after messing it up that badly?
Everyone calling you out but not if you‚Äôre right
Please go to urgent care and get some antibiotics if you have not already. UTIs can become serious if they go untreated.
Damn that was super fucking good.
It's just wholesome content, from questionable sources
Well I for one think small d**** are adorable
No, he controlled the match. He had to be dialed in the whole time and he was.
hello im bipolar 2 the fun kind
Thank you for the detailed response. It‚Äôs about time I worry about making myself happy rather than them.
I loooooove Tiff!!!
Yes I wish more people did this!
When is EVO
I nailed that one on house boats, did you?
[NAME] and [NAME] were the ones I had in mind, but I'm not surprised they're not the only ones from what I've heard.
I was thinking the same thing. It does make me wonder how whomever leaked it, obtained a copy in the first place. 
Jumps like this are often explained by Twitch front page in certain countries. Every time it happens people get accused of view botting.
Thank you for this, so excited!
I'd pause and say yes...? Haha.
Small penis and resulting anger issues.
They also think you're a jealous man instead of an honest - though not very nice - woman.
True, haha. Anywho, have a great day.
She's actually not dead at all. Even now shes still a good hero.
You are terrible developers.
Damn, why y'all posting the match threads this early.
Dude! Coyotes are no joke. Good job, [NAME]. 
Hey, thanks for clarifying. I was trying to find news online without any luck.
Be safe.
y i k e s
Interesting. So people get their cars repossessed and not arrested because ...?
[NAME] just has the runs. Don't worry, [NAME] is lacing up to replace him
My favorite one that you‚Äôve made so far haha Great work
Go with [NAME] brah
Damn straight.
Almost the same Win% as [NAME]. Nice.
Oh man, what was the name of that show. It feels so familiar. Haven't watched MTV in, I don't know, 15 years? 
I'd imagine the confusion would be far greater, especially amongst the [RELIGION] community considering there is no aspect of Ramadan that prevents [NAME] from doing exams. 
Haha, I had this on my clipboard already when I came across your comment.
Thank you for saying that I just haven‚Äôt felt right and I‚Äôm so sad constantly
He was in a state of shock lol
Cool! My [NAME] was in the Maori Battalion, I always wonder if there‚Äôs any photos of him floating around out there.
That was an horrendous season to an otherwise amazing show
Okay, enough me being a great mom.
I‚Äôm disappointed that no one has suggested taking her up Oxo Tower yet.
But it was in Northern Ireland?? I live there?
dear [NAME] they're multiplying...
What's worse is getting in a car that isn't yours
No doubt about that
Also dont have to worry about ramos and robles walking in runs to lose games
This is something that has to be learned from experience. Don't be hard on yourself!
Please don‚Äôt marry this man-child.
"I would say something like ""Hey I've seen you around school... You were in(class)"""
Am I wrong? So many people from NY say it's really gone downhill. Doesn't mean I don't like public transportation
Anyways. Weird behaviour of it when it was happening is that it hid itself when the video was paused then reappeared as the video continued.
I love when [NAME] loses the ball then jogs back on defense
good guy win
Saw them at a free concert on my campus in 2012. They were good.
The President who signed it? FDR.
Really? Some of my posts/comments have been visited by bots How do I kill them?
I like how they roll
Congrats and be well. Peace and tranquility to you. !
Nah I‚Äôm donating it
CL...let‚Äôs just hope we can stay in EL for the time being.
But did [NAME] watch sports bra test videos when he was picking out fernandas ^boobies
Some folks are just bitter and taking it out on the world right now. Don't give into their idocy, keep up the good spirit!
Damn, still hoping...
THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!
She got 3.5 million more votes than [NAME]
Brew bus in the Tampa area?
This dude live near me. All my highschool classmates are big fans of his and look up to him.
> If you love that you probably also love no man sky's algorithm. I loved it back then, because it was the only game. 
Fair, although you'll get caught pretty easily like that
Won't continue. But the positive thing is it's not on fire shooting. It's great ball movement.
Ever seen a lion limber up before it takes down a gazelle?
Wow. I thought the antivaxxers couldn't get any lower. Boy was I super wrong.
And are millennials supposed to be attracted to these? If anything I'd be more offended than encouraged to join.
Ugh I've had my mirena for a few years. I get none of bleeding and all of the cramps
Mental health issues get such a bad rap as it is. I appreciate this comment a lot.
Very interesting to find out about small details like this. Are there any similar problems with any of the other armor sets?
Remember when that one guy went on ‚ÄúCarpenter is awful‚Äù campaign? That meltdown was my favorite
This isn't meant to be a diy thing I think it's a YouTube craft channel they exist because it's calming to watxh
Thank you üëç
So deport the bad guys and let the asylum seekers come in. Sounds like we don‚Äôt need a wall anyway.
yeah, my stbxmil has done the same for all 9 years we've been together. his ex also cheated. everyone knew. they're all besties.
An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being.
Ah, victory 
but it sure looks good
When her daughter says she wants to take all the weight from her and put it on her own body so her mom can go outside and play üò¢‚ù§Ô∏èüò¢
I don‚Äôt like it.
#Fuck the cowgirls & iggles
Are 3.0 still active? I was really hoping they would have gotten signed after their tryout camp a couple years back.
Hope gallery for sure, had [NAME] do mine and a good friend back in 2015. Not sure if he‚Äôs still there, however.
I'm gonna think of a jojo reference for every situation, just you wait reddit. Just you wait...
I don‚Äôt think it retains more fat but you can get bloated and stuff and retaining water will make the scale go up
Have you tried finding other communities to join? Now I know ex-[RELIGION] communities are not that common but just non-religious communities should be rather commen right?
i wouldn‚Äôt want to fight me neither
Nah man. I just changed my mind. I've gotten pms from here before lol.
Well done. I like it!!
Why is she the absolute worst
How terrible. Imagine waiting this long only to die the day before release? I always get that minor anxiety before a highly anticipated album!!
Mountain West/Southwest so far, but it would be awesome if he did a film set in the Idaho/Oregon mountain wilderness.
Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.
I love having an airhorn that double as an oh shit handle. Safe hands, loud horn!
She had it saved on her phone because she was too lazy to delete it. Thank goodness.
Yeah lol like I'm cool with signing/drafting DL but pls not in the first like 3 rounds lol, much less at 2.
I wouldn't mind seeing a discussion with her and [NAME] about their experiences being millennials in Congress. Just having AOC doesn't interest me at all.
Change politicians' healthcare to that of the average citizen, and this could all be sorted out much faster. 
Whew. I'm safe then.
Student of the game. Amazing physical attributes and devastating punching power. Humble enough to take bits and pieces from legends
I drive an old car but it is clean and well maintained.
Definitely the second to be frank. I just wanna get the best deal I can on a car I‚Äôm pretty in love with.
Oh well... I'll like both of you.
Serious props for this it embodies the grumps perfectly.
This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it‚Äôs also the most real he could ever be üòÇ
Let him know a stranger from Reddit thinks he's an idiot
Stay strong, you‚Äôll pull through.
Go play Farmville if you can't keep it up.
This is something kids do on their twitch streams to get subs, pretty sad.
Help me [NAME] I'm bully in high school for no reason.
LMAO I love hockey
I think they mean the banker is being unethical, but I'm not 100% sure
And I‚Äôm studying abroad and my family is taking a very long vacation just to take a break from the uk
True Story.
this is [NAME].
I actually didn't realize that my libido had gone down after getting off hormones, and only noticed it after it reappeared with the IUD :'V
.... You do realize they will eventually hit a glass ceiling since that's unsustainable.
These comments are a reaction to the news article. The news article came first.
So odd numbers one way, even the other. Not too hard to figure out. Would make more sense if they were just in numerical order. 
You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
Oh y√≥u!
That doesn‚Äôt help people in market though.
Here in America too. Those counter protesting fascist get thrown in jail and pepper sprayed like animals. It makes no sense that this happens.
I've been exposed, time to go into hiding. 
Would you PM me details? How did you motivate yourself? Did you fail a few times?
China colonizes Africa. Pakistan colonizes UK. Mexico colonizes USA. What a timeline we are living in!
[NAME] is a socialist I believe. He also seems like a lovely person.
"[NAME], I've told you already. ""Muy gorda chica"" does not mean ""very pretty girl"" "
Sounds like some people could just be a bit confused and maybe not been to a drive thru before
What were the forwards doing letting [NAME] skate up the middle to get that shot of and score?
I'm 35 was married for 10 years and now I'm not and I am so happy to be alone
That‚Äôs a weird way of spelling Tobin.
[NAME]. How are your attempts at arguing reality into agreeing with you going?
Thank [NAME] she did the math for us
Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously.
But that was a long time ago, I wasn't drunk at the time.
Laughing in spitfire mk va.That plane is amazing Especially on breakthrough
no worries, just clean your room
She‚Äôs BFFs with [NAME].
Her bi energy is so strong tbh
Most likely, which, as I understand, isn't respected in pretty much any sense nowadays.
I mean, he did believe in a clearly terrible [NAME] 
Think FARC and Columbia if you're looking for something to compare the Afghan talks to. That's the best that useless war can hope to achieve.
How close I was to retaining last year
shucci a lil BITCH
This is too accurate üòÇ
What about the hipster couple? Were you able to get their lawn on track?
I don‚Äôt go out that way much but even [NAME] is killer if it‚Äôs slippy out.
Liverpool FC is valued at US$1.9b haha.
ah good find. I guess I saw some sort of grade 9 class photo then. Cheers.
You can't argue that these are the same when clearly one of them has a monopoly over the market.
Having kids is bringing into being a conscious person who will suffer and die and be aware of that fact. Become an antinatalist.
We are on the brink, you won't wait long.
My comment provided shame. I am nothing.
What did we do to deserve [NAME]? Loved that guy since his buff days
That's awesome. I never realized it was attributed to [NAME], though.
Interesting... is it a felony in certain jurisdictions?
The fact someone could read your post and literally go and do this saddens me.
I have been to my GP and let college know, I have started some meds but they won't kick in for a while 
omg you like totally caught me!!! i'm just a silly social media girl named [NAME]
Hey, at least its not a fucking sauce post! We really need a new season.
Why would you give your credit info to a company who doesn‚Äôt do background checks???
> YOU DONT GET (ALL OF THE) MONEY IF YOU DONT SPECTATE UNTIL THE END OF GUN RUSH
I mean idk everyone else I know knows but I just feel this identity is right for me
If they declare it, its not a bribe its a political donation... In theory.
Unfortunately later died from eating tainted meat. [NAME] BBC documentary 'dynasties' followed the marsh pride, the lion episode was awesome
Welcome to switzerland üòÇ I see it everyday, when I'm on my way to work. 
"I think you need to explore your motivations a bit more. I very much doubt you just want to know and ""That's all."""
What a respectable women.
Even better than, [NAME] pulls him off the bench.
Your comment has been removed for shaming. Thanks [NAME]
Another church stolen from us. That‚Äôs okay, we will get it back in the great Deus Vulting. 
Cause schools the world over teach a unit about Alaska. OP is an oaf who's never left their hometown.
Fuck me, that is good. 
So, the kicker... her brother played on Xbox so that's the console she had claimed to play on!
The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it‚Äôs been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was.
I would like that.
I think this is what inspired [NAME]
I had this insight too What is it called? Theres probably someone who already had this idea 800 years ago and wrote 7 books about it.
It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere
to the post
Its not that they don‚Äôt know how, it is that they just don‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúSomeone else will get it‚Äù
Classic sloth fuckboi
I want to see someone get decimated by a [NAME] hit
Thanks for gping to the effort, but i would be surprised if he read it and gave it the chance he have trump. Pleasantly surprised, though.
Me too! So pumped! Enjoy the game, bud!
The nightmares I'm going to have tonight would like to thank you in advance.
Why don‚Äôt people just call the cops and give them the video?
When someone swipes over too far when you‚Äôre showing them pictures on your phone
I would pay good money to watch [NAME] vs Dr. Now!!!
Not the best in the world but he can still claim to be the biggest draw. Red pantie night is very real
We're not a cult, so long as he apologizes and sees the fault in his actions, I see no reason to ban him.
If being bisexual means I'm in a cult, I'm kind of pissed because I haven't received my cult robes yet.
[NAME] has continued to show how selfish she is throughout the years..we shouldn't be surprised at this. [NAME] forbid she be the bigger person for the kids.
Yeah I was more poking fun of the fact he won the NHL leadership award last year.
I'd say British humor isn't for everyone. I think he was on point most of the time.
If it's a real challenge for you, u can help you with a ban. Then it's trivial 
Is it because of the accents you thought they were the same?
Chill. Not everyone is perfect.
Yeah, but I mean, you need to actually be motivated for the climate and not just wanting to skip school
"Finally, someone that understands you don't just get to keep information from your spouse about cheating to ""protect them"". That's crazy to me."
">""We're pissed we have been able to pass those savings along to our gas and electric customers. That was the original draft statement."
You are unhinged.
Thank you ladies !
I think it could get pretty boring
"My nmom always says ""Well, you learned from it!"""
Yes, good communication is key and we all see the world through our own unique perspective. Thanks for sharing!
I don‚Äôt understand WHY the [NAME] are so stubborn on this issue. They‚Äôre just like the [NAME] on abortion. Damn the facts!
I saw that, and read it *immediately* in his voice.
That is the issue with most things, if you work there you can not win, as well as friends and family members.
LMFAO now [NAME] is trying to pin it on [NAME] üòÇ
"Oh yeah, I meant it ""doesn't work as an explanation for [NAME]"". Not that the concept is bunk."
I feel so stupid. I‚Äôve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]
Oh dear, The combination of drugs, alcohol and a cell phone has caused many regrets. 
Peaky Blinders is the shit. I don't understand how there isn't more hype around this show.
The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
[NAME] is so daddy
If you enjoyed it, go for it.
"Thank you. I will try to learn fron these. So far i only have read ""models"" and some advices on net."

What a touching memory, /u/FappingPedant (sincerely!) 
I. Love. This. Team.
This is the day we've been waiting for! WWOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I feel sorry for this little girl. She's legitimely scared.
This just really motivated me. Thanks

I realised hatred does only more of self damage. Over time even the hatred fades.
I actually had to rewind a few times because I found myself getting distracted because I was kind of bored.
Do both, son. Do both. You will find the fame you seek.
And feminism, the movement that started with fighting for the right for women to vote hates elections. 
Give him 8/240, ship [NAME] and [NAME] to the Padres in a three-team deal for [NAME]. Boom. I solved the offseason. You're welcome.

Say it louder for the Dwight‚Äôs in the lockers.
Yeah but you expect the idiots who've flooded this sub to know what they're talking about.
Awesome! Glad you found it informative! Thanks for watching.
Sorry but what map is Adlersbrunn? Edit: Ah nevermind I see (after zooming in, it is the [NAME] map)
CONGRATS! Happy for both your personal health journey and being in a healthy place for a relationship, sounds like beginning of an awesome new chapter! 
Being disgusted at disgusting things is grown up.
Like what?
This really tickled my anxiety. I hate it
Mr. [NAME] is basically Wow
Ok. Thanks
Oh. I have anxiety for her and this conversation.
I feel like this list is way off base from what we've been hearing.
Wasn't the Oroville Dam collapse triggered (at least partially) by an overflow?
Still is glitched to this day.... sad
I still get goosebumps every time i hear this track. It's just beautiful .
This reminds me of when it came out that the Hello Kitty! character is actually a human girl.
I hope you survive this. Losing a friend is a heavy loss

Pretty frustrating that when it matters most winning comes down to who cheats the most aggressively
What does Clemson give pride stickers for? Snaps played?
I always imagined they would be really easy to refuel, for obvious reasons. I never had the chance though.
>Pay workers more and charge customers less. I mean, they're a publicly traded company
No, lots of people in that area do that. Hire someone to do your taxes because it'll be a nightmare and so will your commute
They won VEGAS not the PRO LEAGUE QUALIFIER. Stop trying to bait me
oml I‚Äôm so sorry OP for all that
It's a prime-time soap. I feel so guilty.
Stupid play.
May live in Florida, but [NAME], NJ born and raised!!
The irony is, she's probably been wishing for death for far longer.
The poor dude.....pray for him.
Boy does that hit the nail on the head.
Nothing going [NAME] way tonight, lets just blame it on sickness and move on
Oh tell me about it. I'm INTJ
This is good.
> eaten out by their coach
Couldn't have happened to a nicer person.
I definitely expected unwatchable pro-life drama and was quite delighted
The bitch doesnt need drag race (bc shes amazing) but im still sad.
Try your luck with ranked. it you stick it out enough you'll get high enough to play with good players
So we should just complete one study on anything, never question the results or methods, and just accept the initial study as gospel. Gotcha.

I think he‚Äôs likely to be a platoon player with Mad Max this year.
No worries, glad I could help. Just pleased I started learning to read!
For crying out loud, all they had to do was use the smegging wipers!
I mean, they've probably dealt with human vagina blood on a fairly regular basis...
Without bots, I doubt the opposition numbers a million. It's all paid Brock-bots and Twitter Trolls all the way down.
But her emails
I prefer the term window licker. The pub community loves the taste of windex.
I like [NAME]..
 that‚Äôs actually sad, feel bad for him :/
This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.
[NAME].
[NAME] was my favorite. And I liked [NAME] her first season. They both suck now, so damn hard.
But the best part is the struggle snuggle as we like to call it.
That is absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much for your help and support.
The TV anime series is, at least, atrociously bad and stupid. Is full of deus ex and silly cliffhangers.
Yes of course and I catch a lot of it. I just didn‚Äôt realize this was about that!
It was very good! Not a musical fan but it was pretty entertaining.
Yeah, somebody needs to seek counseling immediately. 
some one get me a damn barf bag pease !
But it taste and look so good üí¶üëå
DOES NOT COMPUTE WITH MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM
I got laid the first time directly after that game too Not sure if there's a correlation, just thought I'd contribute
Ayyy! Thanks for finishing it up. Glad someone did. LOL @ your username üòÇüòÇ
[NAME] nutmegger is taking the first shot!
I still want to know what happened with his ex. One minute they were talking babies and the next, [NAME] was engaged to [NAME]...? 
According to you lol. MBTI could potentially be all of those things if applied correctly.
Thanks for clarifying, was definitely originally taught wrong then. üôÉ
an obvious joke
Hooray!! Number 1! Number 1! Number 1! Number 1!
Nah now they‚Äôre the band that covered Toto
this has happened to me twice...most embarrassing shit
I know it sucks and it isn't like it's a new perk multiple swf probably all have it by now
I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.
Never heard of him before, But I believe in [NAME]. He‚Äôs going to be a legend after we hire [NAME]. Long live [NAME].
Speaking of not having a brain, that seems pretty ironic coming from someone with your attitude.
up shut fuck the
Hello fellow Nashville Lions Fan!!!
How would that fix the problem in this case?
And yet you had to walk back your support of this bill when you found out it would catch up your shotgun
All we need is 1 more Trae three and the W and this‚Äôll be a great night
And a hell of a lot better receivers. [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME], [NAME]. 
[NAME] is a really cool name!
Arrg. I never should have let my mother in via SMS. At least it's only SMS.
People that choose to work for NGO's already make far less than their corporate counterparts, do you want them to work for free?
Love this! I'll have to teach [NAME] about Grey Rocking.....and me too
Do you mind me PMing you for some help w/ dealing with the busy season? Thanks.
Isn't that what they all say, with the exception of [NAME], yet there they appear.
"""Grab your Glock when you see [NAME], call the cops when you see [NAME]..."""
That was the gayest thing ive ever heard another man say.

I‚Äôm literally shaking right nowüò´
Character-wise or fighting-wise?
Damn right.
I was chuckling the whole time I read this, I would have loved to be there
Don't stop cold turkey. It's dangerous and you can have deadly seizures. Taper down if you are going to quit any benzo.
If you just slam on the brakes and accommodate these assholes they usually don't even realize they've done anything wrong
Thank you for your kind words! Your energy is contagious!
4-6, 6-4, 3-all, deuce. Could this BE any closer?
Thank you. I think I may know that already, but I might need to hear it from others at times when I miss him a lot. 
I mean I guess they don't get health insurance
Yeah bad timing, but thanks for answering tho have a good rest of your day, cheers!
Yep because running a blower for 5 minutes caused it. Not the millions of vehicles or factories we have.
Can the Ark be filled to the brim with animals? I would love to Dynamite two of every kind.

Happy Easter everyone!!
Thank you very much. I would certainly make a note of your name.
Dude, there is nothing you can do against a team shooting like that, nothing. And out shooting is really good too.
Comment [NAME].
"Presumably he was more excited about making her stay with some pedo jerkoff fantasy of ""Stockholm Syndrome"" .. oh she's staying cuz she looooooves me! "
The pats losing is a good thing.
people will be too lazy to look and just make things up.
I need to shower after reading this
Eh, it'll be alright. Just another battle scar haha. Best of luck to the both of us! 
"Glad I could help. (Side tip: hit return twice to break out of the "">>"")"
To be a buzzkill, something can be both depressing and uplifting and despite being depressing it is most definitely uplifting. 
is it big market privilege? Cause the braves got fucked for similar crimes.
That is one of the things I‚Äôm most excited for in S2. Seeing him playing [NAME] and go off like this so effortlessly is amazing
Yeah it helps me too but I still don't feel well rested the next day
Really? I was in New York last week and had to stand in the freezing cold to pump gas twice.
Crap, crap, mega crap!
Poor kid. He just wanted to rescue his mum from a nefarious organisation. I hope he gets decent representation.
Don't let a few hard months get in the way of a possible beautiful future.

I have the same issue. Except I'm a dude. Talking about my face. One likes me scruffy, the other baby smoothe
[NAME] endorsed [NAME], for one epic fail in that regard. I prefer to make my own informed judgement call, thank you very much
Lol for real tho. But hey, we‚Äôre a football, soccer, and tennis school now
It isn‚Äôt lol just saw a string of comments like this. Probably isn‚Äôt him though
The United States
What are you talking about? I posted this article and am replying to people who reply to me.
RemindMe! 2 months
And you assume they are part of the dominant culture because of the color of their skin. That is self evident racism.
United wins the championship and then profits 20 million off this transfer? Rest of the MLS needs to take notes and catch up
I thought this was only possible on 2K.
My dog died on New Year‚Äôs Day and I wish I could have give her one more treat. She just seized up and died :(
i believe he has a minor ankle injury at the moment, i‚Äôm not too worried about his skating 
Looks like your typical blurry picture to me, but I‚Äôm no doctor.
His playstyle is everything that everyone complains about in Wisconsin basketball and is a cocky little shit, I love him. 
Man that movie is such a classic
Ah I didn't realize I was able to do that. I'm still new to Reddit so I am still learning haha thanks!
It‚Äôs a substitute teacher. She should know to stay in her lane.
My crazy idea ... join the PAC-12 in a combined bid with Boise State football. You all would dominate.
I mean.....they both seem true to me.......
Sorry, I would like your comment, but it's at 666. And I just can't bring myself to change that.
It becomes manageable after I get prep going. But first thing in the morning it‚Äôs always a mess.
So? Many people don‚Äôt resemble their parents.
Lol okay. It's not like they're billion dollar organizations that have their own personal agenda. Fine. Enjoy your bubble.
Guess [NAME] back hurts more than [NAME] neck, a comeback insues.
Haha that's amazing.
Love the new intro song.
You have to demonstrate the necessary being in this world.
I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.
*Peril sensitive sunglasses excluded.
Nah man [NAME] gets made fun of more than anyone lmao
Surely you meant isn't. XD
Pity. I had some decent lunches there, but never went there at night.
Senator [NAME]?
Whoa, should've said that in the post. Threats is not good. I'd find a way to live away from him asap. 
I like you
Some aren't. Either way it's a mystery how they obrained so many M1s.
Favorite: Hardhomme! That epic stare down at the end! Least favorite: No One. Completely ridiculous and unbeleivable
Sounds like you two have something in common.
It looks kind of like pen to me... Which would also make her skin so red.
snitches get stitches
Walk into a fire, life will only get harder, no reason to continue on.
Lol! Great question
"Even [NAME] has said ""I'm happy *for you*"" to pregnant women he's known."
Thank you for doing these, i wanna learn our prospects more and this helps
I‚Äôm not sure are we now taking the word of the FBI and Navy as legitimate sources or what‚Äôs happening here lol?
Realistically speaking, if they were on a VGBC channel, [NAME] would give them a nickname whenever they were on stream, and that would eventually catch on.
Strong and stable...
A life well spent....
Yeah, it‚Äôd be weird to have two green arrows running around. 
Oh [NAME] I love [NAME]!
The only happy ending I enjoyed on this sub. Good job.
But doing those things makes me feel so.... icky.
No one actually claims that [NAME] and [NAME] were real people.
lol..You're not getting [NAME] or any of the young core..
Probably in the same way I find a little cellulite hot. Anyone up for starting a subreddit with boob veins? Lmao
I pulled over at a Walmart on my way home from work to chat with all you beautiful faggots while I listen to the speech.
Especially given today's hyperawareness of sexual harassment, it seems like the smart thing to do, to me.
Nah, lady will come to the resc... oh, sorry, forgot
They call it the hub and spoke system. They neglected to include a wheel.
Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.
"[NAME] i love this ""no one can be THIS happy, what a horrible person he must be"""
Being a woman is not an excuse, you do not represent all women. Thank the lord.
That was the chillest Sharks GDT against an Eastern Conference team in a while.
. . .k but it's unlikely since unless you're a liberal and a woman thinking emotionally often shouldn't be a thing.
Seriously? I have to work Monday. I can‚Äôt be thinking like that over the weekend.
[NAME] is actually a terrible player
Very true. Having a 3rd pair of [NAME] and [NAME] has been solid
I despise [NAME] and all his cronies
At some point, we all hate it. Hey it feels good to be real sometimes. 
No. That's something you can't prove unlike American support to KCK.
yeah but it is easier to not worry when you fix bad habits, no?
Anyone want adopt a dog while we are at this discussion lol?
you guys got hate in your heart
Can you link the apologies? Or do they not actually exist?
:-) Lunch with the wife on a weekday is such a special treat, even when one is under the weather.
So glad my mom didn‚Äôt act this way when I was diagnosed.... oh, and my mom was smart and vaccinated me
How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?
The analogy was in relation to placing the blame for your unrealistic wants and needs on the person who is denying you them.
Yep. The court loves certified letters. That way there is some proof that the letter was received.
Appreciate the love man!! It's a fun game!
No problem. It will seem impossible at first but just keep your cool! Best of luck
Absolutely brutal.
Sounds sensible.
Sorry !! You‚Äôre real good at that!!
Wow are you saying political agitators will drum up a controlled crisis and disseminate the edited video through a foreign fake twitter account

"""Stay in your lane, bro."""
I want to say I'm shocked. I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked.
That‚Äôs what I thought. With 4 out of the 9 still on the show, I just can‚Äôt call it accurate at all.
Hey man you can outline whatever excuse you want to not go ahead with this. I'm just giving you information.
I didn‚Äôt think it was possible for one Twitter account to be so obnoxious, but here it is.
What an obnoxious, drunk girl. 
It‚Äôs not even bad. Some people love dark humor, especially when delivered in a super serious way.
hahaha. She is stunning though!
"Should be ,,How to be a [NAME] Character"""
same here OP, reading some of these stories makes me want to hug my DM for being a decent human being as well as a solid DM
hes doing it for his kid
‚ÄòTwas not MRSA, just ick, apparently.
Hahaha, they are so lost
"That is called ""delusions of reference"" and it is a symptom of acute psychosis. If he is doing any kind of recreational drug that will make it worse. "
[NAME] is such a legendary daddy üò©
I‚Äôve never felt so blessed that I live in a country with wide open roads.
He‚Äôs 60 and never had a HC gig. That should worry folks!
Lol you got nothing to worry bout from me bro. Thanks for keeping the game on
challenge him to a bout of fisticuffs.
Ive got these too, any tips on how to remove/make them less obvious?
I am he does suck
Haha gutted.
As you wish the hard path is a good one :)
Aww man this sucks, but at least he‚Äôs going to Europe, so I‚Äôm happy for him! Goodbye [NAME]! 
Mom has a Buc-ees cup!!
Thank you for being willing to learn
I assume he likes it and wants to share what he loves.
yeah u can have them both!
I think they are tied together. It is very difficult to maintain desire if you cannot accept things about that person.
[NAME] has filled a speech bubble with savage roasts, froze it, and bashed [NAME] over the head with it. [NAME] has fucking died.
The important thing is that you're having fun
Praying for you. Willing to chat if you need it.
I like your version more, anyways. Better comedic relief from such a horribe tragedy.
> he might not have seen the truth by the time he had posted the video That's kinda the *whole fucking problem.* Fake Motherfucking News
I miss the confetti cakes :(
Fellow [NAME] fan, reporting in. She's my favorite character in the series lol. 
EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GET SPAMMED WITH IT WE SHOULD EMAIL THEM THIS
It's actually pretty fun, or it would be if it would run properly...
You clearly read about the young [NAME] footage and made his very bad fan fiction
This joke is disgusting and offensive. Dictionaries don't contain proper nouns!
GNC women?
Why are we making fun of a little kid? He probably hasnt even the ability to grow a neckbeard yet.
I mean I don't think he's gonna come out and call [NAME] a bitch even if he feels that way
Can‚Äôt even tell what‚Äôs happening here. This isn‚Äôt cringe.
‚ÄúI doubt I‚Äôm done writing‚Äù Kill me
Who was it? I got here after it was deleted, and I'd like to read the comment history.
And ammo?
History was written by the victors. Now we have history witten by the real truth agreed upon the everybody on the network
That's probably a good idea. Call them and see if they can help you.
[NAME] throwing the ball to Spain
Hopefully you saved that letter!
"""By far one of the best"" Mmmm"
The people are WAY nicer
I'm gonna pm you :)
We should have had a dman protecting the net on that play. Our future is Taco's
Stop. How can you watch [NAME] these past years and think he has 2-3 years left.
Yes, but you don't need it to play.
Their Cinnamon Chip Bread is also quite good.
I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. I‚Äôm glad you got out of it.
Shamelessly stolen from Three Flavours Cornetto Posting
Because I don't like being fat lol.
Definitely not the norm in KY or other bible belt states, sadly. My extended family looks upon my CF lifestyle with nothing but bingo's.
What if she runs back to you just for more attention but still no interest in dating?
I did that, I asked for a white doctor and they gave me a list of black doctors.
Downtown is inconvenient, look like you've gone full county, enjoy your strip mall 
Realize that all those feelings she had for you were lies. She is liar. Don't let her take up space in your head rent free.
Agreed sis. But I was just annoyed at that point and wanted to get laid. Didn't happen though. Oh well. Thanks!!
I‚Äôm not sure how to feel after reading this... I will say that [NAME] and [NAME] would be an attractive couple.
Who doesn't have unlimited calls???
Yeah. [NAME] couldn't do it, [NAME] couldn't do it. It's probably not gonna happen again
"Justifying a potential rape because ""it's [NAME] and she should feel thankful,"" Wow. "
Ladies and gentlemen; that there's our future #1 elite goaltender. We got 'em.
Second this. I have an anxiety disorder that has resulted in me never working a job, but my career is making YouTube videos self employed atm. 
We got fucked
You're welcome
That's great to hear. I hope you get it, and have many years with that job.
What if your only job was recovery?
Ha! You're right! I don't know why I assume you were male. Sorry. :)
Thank [NAME] there wasn't a psychologist among the testers
I mentioned it was only for three weeks. I know it‚Äôs not over yet.
I believe they shot him through the door in the back.
Yeah I don't mind the odd hunter or a daddy long legs but fuck those red backs. And whitetails Those cunts are vicious as all hell
I‚Äôm in ND too and I‚Äôve maybe seen two people use studded tires in the two years I‚Äôve lived here.
*and, sorry for the spelling mistake
Best side quest ever!
Yeah, I always thought [NAME] would be an improved [NAME]. It's a damn shame we haven't thrown to him more often.
Im so glad that he Reacted that way i feel the same way about my college but im in the last semester ü§ì
if he ended up with that chef, damn that will break my heart for sure.
This girl wasn't molested. She was a young (legal) girl who thought it was cool to get with someone her dads age
I always wondered why that never happened with the ‚Äúmuscles from Brussels‚Äù in any of his movies.
Seems familiar
My favorite [NAME] and she was awesome as [NAME]. I also loved her playing the opposite [NAME] to [NAME] in DS9.
I enjoyed this TED talk.
Sub... chill... I see what you did there...
"""Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male! There are already enough girl characters. We don't need a third!"""
That should be fun. I may have call in sick tomorrow. Lots of Bournemouth fans including my boss.
Man hope he recovers fast. Looked really painful
I just open mouth laughed so loud my kids came out of their bedrooms, phone in hand, but still...they came out!
Which is a huge shame since it took place at Wrestle Kingdom. Hoping he has a great reign filled with good matches.
No I actually really like that I don‚Äôt have to pump my own gas.
I think I might like a front end web developer job but not positive since I've always been in healthcare/science
I didn't have an umbrella and got wet but it's so damn humid still it's all stanky feeling outside.
Recently swapped my sanwa out back for a hori with a heavy spring . it feels really good
As much as I love the dodgers, I can‚Äôt see them in the World Series 3 times in a row... so yeah, backwards.
Been off since November 29th. I would rather be working and making money. Home gets boring
I guess they still have hopes to keep AD...
Hey, [NAME] nerf to basic damage and no damage mitigation in stealth! Thank [NAME]!
I love when these self-proclaimed ones would hound me for more pics.
WAS can always pay the trade kicker. But am only willing to dump [NAME] for him. Not down for giving up DFS.
Oh, boo fuckety hoo. Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin.
Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That‚Äôs fucked up
[NAME]! He was just amazing, best contract ever, so sad when we lost him. 
Nobody has the money to. What a joke
Seriously. [NAME] is a hero. I heard he was a volunteer firefighter during 9/11.
I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
that's like a kel'thuzad/kael'thas wet dream right there. Line them up for disgusting aoe XD
[NAME] could be so valuable if we didnt rely on him to create
If you've only flown private for most of your life, it's hard to not think it's uncomfortable. 
Woodfield Mall is pretty good still.
He is not actually trying to watch child pornography, he is simply trying to shock and disgust the reader
Bye, [NAME].
Yep, you can go around crashing into things and run people over and completely get away with it. 
I don't think they consider geometric patters to be abstract art.
If we don‚Äôt get [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or [NAME]..... I‚Äôll be so sad 
Always go for someone you like and feel connected to.
I have failed you [NAME]. I have failed you.
It's amazing the people here supporting the [RELIGION] church and the child molesters over duterte... I wonder why.
Love this picture
That's how it be sometimes.
Hehe if you think Mesmer is slow you haven‚Äôt seen anything yet. Chrono and mirage OOF.
I wonder how Florida will like him hahah
[NAME] likes making us excited, but not *too* excited
You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
Probably. Someone posted something along that in the 90df sub when people were asking why [NAME] were shopping at an expensive furniture store.
If you know anything about those sources then either you understand the dismissal or we aren't going to agree.
For free? Tell him you ain no prude. You want $100
Your 17. End of conversation. You don‚Äôt love him
Rip ok lol
So edgy.
Try using a different browser and see if it helps.
In other words this looks bad, so we‚Äôre trying to distance ourselves from it. Yeah too bad NRA. Zero sympathy from here. 
Or In my blood by [NAME]üòÖ
Sometimes I want these guys to make it. Sometimes I want these dumbasses to fail.
I'm not talking about [RELIGION] anymore though...
I wonder what number he'll wear since he can't wear 20.
Sounds fancy, is there any in flight entertainment?
July 15, 1996: Yanks to the Rescue! The Secret Story of How American Advisors Helped [NAME] Win
Upvote for you, and shared the cleverness with my wife!
Justified or not he'll probably go before [NAME]
When you can see the redzone interception coming 5 seconds before it was thrown.
Why cant I ever see these comments linking things until the day AFTER i make my comment
They‚Äôve got 1.5 stars off 43 reviews on Yelp. You‚Äôve got to be pretty bad to get that low.
Yes [NAME]!! Give us interviews üñ§üíú love this idea
Nah, a lot of the USCG bashing is legit, not jokes. So, SO many people legitimately think they literally aren't even military.
They are awesome!
[NAME] and [NAME]. Both are really cute in different ways
"*concussion* *Trophy system kills it* *Another concussion* *Trophy system kills it* ""Yo guys watch me throw this cluster"" Honestly embarrassing "
Alright then, I'm glad to hear that. I hope it's handled in any case.
Ha congrats!
Alleviate' meaning what? Make my working life suck less?
ah! you¬¥re welcome! :)
Thanks for your kind words. They made me tear up a bit.
People actually cancelled their subscriptions because they didn't endorse him. These same people call others 'snowflakes'. lol
Reckon she'd have your back too OP!
It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
Not my proudest fap
If she says she is thinking of leaving maybe she wants you to prove to her that she shouldn't?
I wish I could :( tried
obviously, its just a stupid question
Thank you! Do you know what agency would be interested in this information?
Happy Cake day!
Firm, but gentle. Baby hamsters or live goldfish. Soft female hands caressing my balls is a wonderful feeling. 
Yeah... if only those communist governments were left in place... they‚Äôd be soaring!!
That's too many pills
THEY CALLED ME M I S T E R A S S
My Dad married his high school girlfriend when he was 47. It‚Äôs never too late!!
[NAME] is vastly overrated. Much bette4 [RELIGION] delis in the outer Burroughs
Thanks dude. It‚Äôs honestly hard to distinguish because it‚Äôs felt like who I was for so long
that is the saddest damn yogurt ive ever seen
You actually have a point. But I think as long as they both dont have an issue atm it should be okay.
I was going to mention The Dana Carvey Show, gosh darn it. And you forgot [NAME].
Oh wow. Yeah I‚Äôm very new, only about 8 hours gameplay
It‚Äôs the world record egg!
Standing O for the biggest Knick loser in franchise history... and that's saying something!!
damn, Now THAT's detail.
Kids can't have fun anymore...:(
**Didn‚Äôt really think about it at the time. Either way, everything‚Äôs still visible and the content is the same.**
Ditto. I never pay attention to who‚Äôs posting comments I disagree with. What difference does it make?
its treason then
wouldnt like most of the pokemon fanbase be adults now tho
Even without the age thing, going after a coworker over a crush has a 9 out of 10 chances to end badly. 
Can confirm 14 year olds can be thots.
lol I‚Äôm realizing that now!
Doesnt have insane standards or anything. I don't see what's wrong?
then never drive because the person in the other lane could swerve over and kill you
Too late with having it back. I really did'nt have much back then. So I had a really hard time too.
You‚Äôre thinking agnosticism, atheism is a faith based position 
That arena is so ugly I‚Äôd be scared too
Thank you :)
I once was the 2001st like on a youtube comment. It felt really good to be able to constantly flip that like count between 2K and 2.1K.
This may be the first thing I've seen on here that actually made me laugh instead of just an amused nasal exhalation.
nice looks like I hit just about hit the sweet spot, thanks
Go see a therapist! Your hospital has them. Post traumatic events sometimes need therapy and that‚Äôs ok!
bad acts at a reasonable price
Happy cake day man

What type would you classify House from House M. D.? (T. V. SHOW BUT OK
That definitely makes him a terrorist.
The reason most people don't get the joke is because it's such a bad one, that they think that it's not meant to be one.
My lawyer is on it and I have been advised to not speak with respects to legal matters until we have things resolved. Thank you for your support.
[NAME] uh...gave me a wake up call. Thank you
Please kind sir may I have some more
The barriers in large only exist with respect to Canadian oil. Other producers (with the exclusion of Venezuela ) seem to be enjoying a very profitable time.
Man, she must really hate infertile women. 
With some ultra cold coming, we could get some seriously great sundogs. Provided you don't die looking at it due to exposure...
He was dead through the whole movie. Oh wait
Forget every single acronym and buzz word from TRP. Never think using that terminology.
And here i am, cant even clean my tongue without gagging... 
I completely despise bixby with the intensity of the sun.
Peta killed a dog once, so peta is bad, so veganism is bad, so its ok to kill and eat billions of animals (including dogs)
Are we seeking attention? Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Bet that'd cut down on road traffic accidents.
Did I miss something? I don't think she's announced yet. Someone could still beat her to it.
Seahawks themselves are insufferable, so I would prefer a Dallas win. If only they both could somehow lose simultaneously...

People deleting and stop caring IS THE REASON why artifact is under 2k players.
They don't get this. They think the universe revolves around them so the rest of the world has to do whatever benefits the narc.

Feb 2nd you reset to zero so call in today to make sure you are healthy call it a health day.
What? Shut up?
Surely this particular one an extreme example? Thinking his brother is a lizard....
Lol don‚Äôt act like you care if you aren‚Äôt willing to back it up. Cheers
Fair enough ;)
Sure, as long as you don't ask me what would happen if I got stranded on an island.
Can the mods just delete this crap
...says a fellow redditor.
I would also have all this issues if I looked myself in the mirror dressing like that
Only if you roll all the windows down....and pay no attention to what I'll be doing.
Not that poster, but huh, 
They put whoever has the highest gamescore on a winning team that night, and that happened to be [NAME]
I‚Äôm going to say it. Those films are mostly over rated. Boring same old tame CGI stuff every time.
But sweat pea it‚Äôs a MAN wearing makeup! My gay bestie BABES üç≠üçÜüßñ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
why does this feel like rightwing propaganda made because they are pant shittingly terrified of her...
! remind me 2 days
No thanks probably stank af.
wow...u wanna say u were never toxic and u never rage okay if u can t do what I asked just go away ok???
Because they want to make money.
No doubt would start at wing. We need help there and it would help ease him in
All you need to read is [NAME] death near the end of the book to remind you... ‚ÄúTwas a comical effect.‚Äù
They make money to sit and talk to you there's no reason to feel like a burdon cause it's legit their job.
> No one likes being made to vote more often than they have to. My love of the sausage sizzle says otherwise!
Holy shit I didn‚Äôt realize he didn‚Äôt fumble all season that‚Äôs wild
Glad things came out alright for you...
That was the most boring movie I‚Äôve ever seen
Sometimes I literally need to shut myself in a quiet room so I can think.
Kicking out a child for a biological trait beyond their control objectively makes him a bad father.
That was an incredibly dumb thing to do. [NAME] is an idiot for trusting her.
what about the balls!?
*Lente, otherwise a great song. Theme song to my varsity years

Oh I can't wait until they have sole rights to our game.
Why? You might be right I didn‚Äôt think of that but I‚Äôm curious to what issue that would create
From red deer as well. Don't worry not all of us are ignorant and hateful.
Lol! I‚Äôm glad you feel lucky because you are! Could you imagine dealing with the continuous flipping back and forth between desire and guilt? üò¨
BECAUSE THIS ARTICLE IS THE CLINCHER [NAME] IS [NAME] LAST NIGHT AS A FREE MAN
You're right! What a nightmare.

We got some good sex scenes or is it blue balling BS?
at least it rhymes,i'll give you that
I have 100% went to Wendy‚Äôs more after realizing I‚Äôm attracted to their mascot thanks to sassy twitter memes.
I love [NAME], but this sounds like he‚Äôs claiming signing a 26 year old superstar is stupid. Come on.
"I like the ""filler"" episodes, believe it or not. I actually get bored by the battles "
Nah you just gotta know how to use him. I've had great matches using him
Thank you all for the insight.
Praise Blucifer!
You do realize that every cod since cod 4 has had some sort of sbmm right? Like every MP Fps like Battlefield.

It‚Äôs legal in TX but with restrictions. Traffic has to be moving slower than 15mph and the rider cannot exceed 30mph
Wow Toxicity has been done thousands of times, becoming less and less original, try something new. NEXT! 
Wrong. And UBI sucks unless you include an expansive social safety net too
No noodlebox for you then. Sorry.
Hey, I made it in the screenshot!

Love Mac n Gold

I love how adgag laws are legalized illegal activities, look it up!
Good idea. With the power of those two consoles combined we might be able to get the fps up into double digits
I checked there but thank you!
No we‚Äôre going to use it for penalties decisions, red cards and goals like it‚Äôs designed for.
It's not hypocritical to find annoying behaviour annoying. The two situations aren't mutually exclusive.
Article says she was present when this happened sometimes and that she was physically and psychologically abusive as well
I disagree. In that I believe that season 3 was also very good. I think it's better than season 4.
Haha fucking gottem
Sorry, but isn't this a little too obvious? As the old saying, the early bird catches the worm.
Thanks [NAME] but I don't think you understood the context of the phrase in my post and you should probably just fuck off.
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
Dude I hope you get help and get clean again. Best of luck to you.
He got caught stealing luggage and got arrested for a felony. That‚Äôs the general story. What kinda emotion could I add?
Same here. And I really dislike strangers and groups, so groups of strangers are a next-level nightmare. 
breaking news: sports fan does something extreme and stupid over something that doesn't matter
That sub is filled with people who want other people to do things for them. A revolution would be to much effort.
You seriously reposted your repost of the same repost you reposted again.
except for the implication that white colonialism saved the native population from barbarism
LOL. Super cute!
Two year old account with all posts deleted. This is an interesting way to use a shill account.
That makes sense, thanks
That would be fun
See ya!

No they don't.
Thank you for such kind words.
It‚Äôs the NRA, I don‚Äôt think it should shock anyone regardless.
I just want to die. I don't want to keep trying.
And the secret weapon, in case of emergencies: TRIPPLE THE OFFENSE!
It would be quite difficult, considering that I don't actually have any to begin with, hence the question. 
"Walkerton for anyone who is curious about the actual real deaths under ""chainsaw"" [NAME] "
I'd sure as hell hope their washing their hands after at least.
Yeah keep filming your kid kicking a dog in the face. I'm suprised this isn't on r/funny
Yeah mine asked me to marry her over email and then ghosted me for three weeks...
Something new! Finally...
Fight milk ü•õ lol
Nothing gets past you!
Thanks man, hope the holidays were good to you and yours. 
Based on what I've seen, all the INFJ girls seem to be blue-haired damaged moonquacks that got abandoned by daddy.
I recently won a match going 12/19. Always ends the same way you thanking them profusely and them being slightly annoyed.
Damn, for real? I'm 250 and drink regularly, if I pound two beers in under a minute I'm good for a little while.
He was already hard when I came in
sacked surely. no one would expect to be kept on after making such corrupt mistakes in their own job.
It's mostly what kids are enjoying at the time. I know I associate Minecraft with my little brother would watch cringey Minecraft YouTube videos all day
No wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
There‚Äôs no where for him to play. He wants to play [NAME] and that‚Äôs taken by [NAME]. We have [NAME] at 3rd.
Oh no, are you going to be psychologically tormented and cry in the shower about it later? 
Peaky blinders. No one else in my life has heard of it or will give it a chance.
This is what happens when untrained people playing at being detectives and judges run into actual detectives and judges.
It sucks being unattractive. It pisses me off that there are so many beautiful people in the world, and I ain't one of them.
No we don't. A small amount is imported into Ontario. The rest of Canada is long or balanced.
Well of course there was an accident they were all driving on the wrong side of the road.
You're a legend.
What should be the campaign is telling people that just because you find a child beautiful/pretty, it doesn't mean you're sexually attracted. 
Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits.
This hit a little too close to home
Just one or two, but it is hard since so few transphobes *have* souls.
??? Where the hell is this article getting it's data from...
This really bothers me too. I completely agree. It would have helped us avoid a US situation. Now I think we're barreling toward it
Happy birthday! Enjoy your day and [NAME] should close this out as a present :)
Nice work!
Flat out getting our ass kicked. Gotta give it to Memphis, they have just shut us down
They‚Äôre so angry!
Every time I think about how close we were to getting [NAME] it hurts a little bit more...
To be completely fair, before the break-up (in the books), [NAME] wanted to marry her. [NAME] told him to stfu. 
Ah man great memories .. campaigns were soo memorable
You said you're in college, right? What are you majoring/minoring in? 
Is there any example in History where a 'multicultural' society has succeeded to the point of them becoming a major power?
I love the small hole in the clouds with the moon (sun?) peeking through
Yes, it's Harbinger, and you can get it in the Cosmic Chest.
It's amazing that things like this still exist, considering how much English-language education there is. 
its not even illegal for like siblings and parents/children to have sex as long as they are adults and consenting when the relationship begins.
You know what's coming, right?
I hear the ruler's control is remote and is viewed with great reception.
They‚Äôre speaking Spanish and the character is racist, making the experience terrifying
OP may have been avoiding [NAME] jokes.
alarms are kinda rude.
Opinions? I mean that's just a statement.
Hard to get motivated to play when the fans are burying one of your teammates.
They did. They used [NAME] crews and had soundbytes from #metoo and the supreme Court trial.
Because she wanted to look at the American girls lol
Skynet has really lost its edge
The Dude looks great. I always get worried when I see [NAME] play these haggard characters. But he's just that good.
I wouldn't get your hopes up until you've been dating a while.
Yeah, look at the publicity for just that. 
I live in Baltimore and heard she will have an office out of here. Any details on how I can volunteer for her campaign?
Completely! She's not even close to that skin color.
Take your upvote, you no good bastard.
My mom does this all the time. I've always wondered why she feels the need to do it. Can you tell me why you do it?
Have that pic.
OH me too, didn‚Äôt realize it was really a thing till now üòÇ
I feel like you should, in commemoration.
Me neither :/ devastating actually. As all his policies are. Terrible time for Ontario.
Is that because it's an accurate description of the politician and he's trying to distract from his guilt?
Velvet Taco, and it is amazing.
You don‚Äôt know how many screens it‚Äôs playing on in his room
Expect a bunch of bugs as a reward.
Well that totally explains why we're on both ends of the spectrum lol
She has naturally chubby cheeks that are set on high cheekbones. I've seen it before and it's not abnormal.
I'm a Bioware fanboy so obviously biased. I even enjoyed Andromeda. Haha.
Yeah fucking thanks, politicians back in the day.
Good for him, most guys are like [NAME] and would take her back in an instant.
That cut to [NAME] looking at the camera was hilarious.
No. It‚Äôs slower and takes more calculation but it can be done. That‚Äôs why it should be practiced.
Thank you for the kind words :)
>You wrote a lot of words, and I don't really understand the context. This is a pretty succinct description of competitive debate.
I feel like i really want to go learn metal casting from [NAME] now
I loved Masters because they were air conditioned. It was worth the extra drive on a 40 degree day.
I suggest that you start by not apologising before you do something harmless (e.g. the beginning of this thread)
the worse part is you might be crazy yourself and have no idea!
That was the worst power play I‚Äôve ever seen
A divided Korea, is a divided Asia. The day Korea re-unites, will be the day Asia gets back control of their own destiny.
I actually liked them. I love the idea of Conqueror being a rabid and maniac dog.
Clam is what your looking for.
It was a wild circus for a few years here, lol
A friend of mine is like that, and they seemed quiet upset when someone form middle school said hello after they hadn't talked for 13 years. 
See a lawyer, there's more trouble coming from your ex... She likes free money And a accountant...
And that's an issue. Councils are *so* unrepresentative it hurts.
This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.
Wow üòÆ you really convinced me... like gtfo here
whats the [NAME] story ? sorry, not up to date on the bloke
Yeah I just googled that, I still wouldn't call them my favourite restaurant but its cheap!
I'm just salty man. I hate playing Houston. I'm sure it's a nice place to live.
now i wanna know what their username was. was it worse than /u/JusticeForShangeIa lmao
Unique in a subreddit dedicated to finding concurring views? xD Oof
This is an Opinion article, just keep that in mind.
Can we also get some love for torb? Give his turret deployment the same treatment while we're at it.
That unfortunately still doesn‚Äôt stop the thoughts or really address any issue I raised in my post. thanks for your concern though mate. I appreciate it
There is clear video of them harassing people before any confrontation.
It's disturbing that this tweet got so many likes. Like, this is why twitter has a cancerous reputation.
Even if you don't act on them, you still should stay away. It's not normal to fantasize about doing sexual things to children.
That‚Äôs nightmare fuel right there
Are we talking about [NAME] or [NAME]?
Don't be a [NAME] and misuse this term. We've reserved it for a movement of women who are done with sexual harassment.
Would parking still be free on the weekends?
Got a bit tipsy in my room alone, dancing in my underwear to some cheesy music for the whole night, and then cried myself to sleep
Which is weird because I can still get hours every week the day before if I wanted to.
I have no answers for you, but I send you warm enfolding hugs of understanding and light. Peace to you.
‚Äú[NAME], tell [NAME] what you bought when I sent you to town to get that weird thing.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúCurse you, magic beans!‚Äù
Not all. [NAME] is cool. If he ever runs again in the primaries he will get my vote.
Asexual and attractive
Well i gave you my reasoning, if you're not interested in responding why waste you're time being annoying. 
At some point in the season the whole bench is about to do it lol
 It an argument. Don‚Äôt really have time for jack-assery. Lot of people want attention from me tonight, not just you. 
Orange kitty has a bit of concern in his face.
I love you
How old are you?
They are dangerous AF. I had a student faceplant and break her face, and my daughter's friend hit his head and is in a coma.
It means less when you hear words come out of her foul mouth. Almost incomprehensible.
Haha username checks out, but I thank you all xx
Ugh, [NAME]. Gross. 
I‚Äôm sorry to hear this. Live a hell of a life for your mate
It's telling that they're offended by a symbol of equality but a symbol of hate (yes, it is) is fine to them
No my friend, no, I no make fuck-fuck. I take you to girls, many many girls. You make fuck-fuck with girls.
This got a little personal for me
Thank goodness it's a rare add on in that case xD Thanks for the info! :)
I think by and large it encouraged men to become better betas.
Good catch. I guess I was just remembering the shift after the first debate. That's pretty sad, tbh. 
I actually did just after writing it hope the poster doesn't mind, but just so you can find 
They could not have done the same thing. Only certain things can go in a reconciliation bill.
Better than the posted joke! thanks!
"I'm no [NAME] but I do use their saying, ""Hate the sin and not the sinner."" Do your very best and keep going. üçç‚úå"
That‚Äôs one big-ass bath candle.
I miss [NAME] wish we could trade back for him!
Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
What makes this not the place and time?
[NAME] would be an exciting guy to bring here. I think he'd at some help at RB, especially if [NAME] ain't interested
Wonder how he feels about [NAME] now
Ahhhhhh [NAME] had to finish that. But beautiful pass from [NAME]
After listening to the lecture, I‚Äôve concluded that there‚Äôs no way this kid isn‚Äôt a redditor
Notley-nomics helps grow the economy once again! Thank [NAME] we have such good governance.
You probably just have a fashion preference, if you arn't dysphoric about it then you don't have another gender really. 
Because the PS4 doesnt have any incredible exclusives? Edit: I was being sarcastic, please stop trying to teach me which games are good PS4 exclusives :(
Maybe even pay less with the UCP!
SO SMUG!
I'm imagining impossible skill checks doc with a pig. Being in madness 3 with a reverse bear trap on you in the radius of unnerving pressence *shutters*
I watched that game while coming down from a shrooms trip. [NAME] was magic. Still wear his jersey to shinny :D
I‚Äôm not crying, you are!!! üò¢
Damnit--good point.
Thank you very much I appreciate the enthusiasm btw do you know more or less how much space will I need to install it?
Lmao. Whatever you say bud.
[NAME] is a damn fool. No wonder his ex-wife is his boss and his babysitter.
"The ""awesome"" shipping service that promises 2 days but still takes a week? Lol"
‚ÄúReal men‚Äù. [NAME] be more offensive.
I didn't downvote you so I couldn't tell yah why. It was definitely infected that's why it was red and swollen.
Hey you need that fifth DPS player that just keeps feeding or that bastion on attack.
Yeah, it's disgusting & I'm so disturbed by everything going on. Never ever would I have believed this is where people were headed. 
Well in that case you should just tell other people I guess. And welcome to Reddit.
"lol you're like a fucking child. ""No you!"" Thanks for the laugh man. "
he's playing you on not just this point and you eat it up.
This is your first boyfriend so you're overanalyzing more than you normally would. It's your issue you just have to move past it.
Worst ending ever! I won't spoil it but this one sucked worse than the avengers last movie!
I'll never understand how people make so many typos in posts that are meant to convey a serious, thoughtful message. 
This is sheikh [NAME]
You're thinking of [NAME]. [NAME] been a senator since 2009 and is up for reelection in 2020
The bot did its job. It‚Äôs me the awful one
Concas! In vic park. Been closed down multiple times for health and safety violations lol
If we find a solid rental centre again maybe.
horse meat is fucking peng i love it. why is it ok for a cow to be slaughtered for food but not a horse? ridiculous double standards
Chuckled. Upvote!
I know! It amazes me every day, but I'm SO, SO thankful for those lists.
In the prequels the son couldn't save the mother. Maybe things will be different this time...
I played for a decade+ on release, I'd be happy to help you or anyone else!
In like 5 years, your entire high school career will be one entire cringe. Congratulations. 
Please post in the stickied thread. (Rule 3).
Three times a year? Where/what are you eating?
I don't know a ton about the history of this specific example so I can't really say.
They don't like when you point that out.
we're getting our top men right on that.
yiss they buffed [NAME], my favorite talent <3
Y'all just joking but I want to hear what they eat, and I want pictures too so [NAME] step your game up 
Thanks for the info! Great pic. I‚Äôve saved it.
I feel personally attacked by this salad
I think I‚Äôd take the long view - the good news is that at least she‚Äôs not pregnant...
Yeah, I‚Äôd definitely wanna be baked for that
Can confirm it's very cold in Chicago today
This was so helpful! Thank you. I really needed to hear something inspiring for once, instead of just hearing that I‚Äôm not doing enough.
oh okay gotcha! i was really baffled at that lol
[NAME]! Came here to say that. Have an upvote. And a hug.
Oh hell yeah
My friend can't kiss her husband if he's had gluten and not washed his face.
Please stop LOOKING, and go.
RemindMe! 1 day
[NAME] just reminded us last night why he‚Äôs paid his ridiculous wages
well the irony is that felons are discriminated against, even non violent offenders.
I don't think [NAME] has landed any key punches as of yet
Subsidies and tax breaks, same as here
"so lucky. im afraid to tell my [NAME] gf. :"")"
I love [NAME]. I really love him. Xx
Sorry, but you probably do given the AVers do have a limited literary skills at the best of times.
There is no quick fix to controlling it better. For pwBPD it tends to require a lot of therapy, often DBT.
There's a lot like that though: I don't think so.
I came here for this. You and your fancy teeth filled with toxic PFAS can bite me!
That is not a snake its a tree, it looks like some sort of beach tree to me.
I just walked past y'all! Wish I had seen this thread earlier.
Its more about Russia not making such overtly antagonistic statements about Iran.
I think Bayern get far less hate than they should tbh, the Manchester United of Germany is almost selling them short.
I was booing loud, so were a lotta others. That muthafuckah
This is brilliant
You mean like popping the cork with your thumb as people have done for the last 100+ years.
So it isn‚Äôt pretty much the same? Glad you think I‚Äôm right then.
[NAME] has been a lot better since he stopped doing Xanax with [NAME]
she got knocked the f out!
that number 3 is soooo familiar and sad.
I am already using ublock. Thank you for suggesting ghostery, didn't know it.
I almost felt sorry for him. Almost.
Ok cheers. I‚Äôm banned from there
It depresses me that the Carousel revamp has been a popular answer. Thats not a change, that a sliding scale adjustment.
i thought it was very coincidental that i was listening to 808‚Äôs while doing this bullshit and that this question popped up unexpectedly. made me smile
That is odd.
It's Shrimpy ( I'm pretty happy with it and the telegram is decently active too
......man Shes a decent candidate. But [NAME] is better. Well see. Lets hope for a legit primary.
No chance unless he smokes out of a gas mask or suffers a bad injury.
I think dogs should vote!! It's alright. We're your friends now. Cheers, pal!
Beet Juice and strawberries on top to hide the ugly blob looking thing on top?
i love this video
Honestly I don't celebrate any holidays including new years, and whatnot. 
But we not out performing like she is, we just need a less matte version to keep us through our daily struggle life. 
Without US attempting to do a regime change by funding jihadists in the first place there wouldnt have been a syrian civil war.
if it's a ghost pepper milk just tickles it. but yeah milk is better then water either way.
Because [NAME] loves the American military more than any other one.
Yes it absolutely is, that's just not it's formal name. [NAME] commiting treason is absolutely a crime
Oh boy, yeah!
That‚Äôs one of the many sleeping cycles of my fucked-up schedule :)
Wait, what? Lol. Weak call. I'll take it. 
And? That still doesn‚Äôt debate the fact that he‚Äôs all about the money?
When it's time, it's time.
we need more [NAME] like [NAME] and [NAME]. So far those are the only 2 who I have seen stick to their principles.
Not rare, considering how large the metro area is now. For an individual being impacted by one it is very rare though.
second temple stood for 420 years r/trees /r/Judiasm crossover confirmed!!!!!
Yikes. She sounds like she's one bad grade away from shooting up a synagogue.
Just a quick correction: if the next tax bracket is 10% than $10001 would be taxed $500.10
I love how all these suspects greet [NAME] like an old friend.
The amount of people there saying water is free is astounding. How out of touch with reality can you be?
yes but how many new characters were there? Checkmate atheists. :)
Omg two little blankets for your penis. LOVE THAT.
You‚Äôre an awful troll...
You're both wrong NBA is an initialism, can't be pronounced as a word. Oh man I love reddit

She's reading Canada's extradition act but not Canada's extradition treaty with the USA. I've had this argument before, it's pointless.
NBA Record 3-3 [NAME] o3.5 ast @ 1.85 [NAME] o22.5 pts @ 1.85 [NAME] u25.5 pts @ 1.85
Thanks for making me laugh my way into a sinus headache.
There is no 'H' in [NAME]. Source: |
its ok i understood
Phsyically, not mentally or emotionally. It's literally only been one week since the end of episode 2 and the start of episode 3.
You just gotta have little faith. They are gonna need more money and maybe then we can get to Tahiti.
He only said that to piss [NAME] off because he wanted her to kill him and put him out of his misery. He‚Äôs a good guy.
I won't ever be having sex with someone at a club. Nothing against one night stands though.
If this thread turns into a shitshow like the last it will also be locked. Fair warning...
Shame Saints aren't even going to get a LBP out of this game, feels like that's the minimum deserved
keeping an eye out in case of another shooting
I'm shaking in my boots
That works too. To each their own.
The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself.
i understand that means i will have no luck for compensation
Lmao all these othr trades happened so I think it's a silly marketing ploy.
Cuties! Love you!
When I was a young warthog!
Describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother.
You know what? Mine is just more of the bullshit. Nothing‚Äôs changed. I finally woke up.
Now, remember, this is a very dulled version of what were used to considering they‚Äôre still riding the super bowl high from last year. 
That is so sick. That kid will feel sooo awesome later in life. What doctor agreed to this though?
That's a juicy offer. Pity if it goes sour
Sounds like a fun game. Our home game around here is .05/.10. Its fun but not very exciting.
Exactly. It was The fact that everything happened and ended so suddenly that left me speechless.
I know they are treated very well, but some of them do die.
becasue [NAME] is a propaganda meister, its his job. Come on now 
They exclusively post movie links to this sub it's pretty weird.
Get a lawyer. You entered into your marriage in good faith, that shouldvcount for something. 
generally they go for a few thousand
I think that's how the game will end. With [NAME] talking to [NAME] again. Don't know if I'm prepared for that
I realised that baby [NAME] looked like young [NAME] and it really upset me. So you all have to deal with that now too.
But then you regret it because you realize you secretly liked the attention. Just bottom things.
Oh it just means I‚Äôm soon to graduate, in my final year of undergraduate study.
At this point they should start playing Sweet Georgia Brown over the PA system...
The amount of empty seats at the Orange Bowl was pretty bad
I hope all of y'all that are commenting isn't all men because not all women do that!
A one-line whip is still whipping against, although it is a pretty disappointing decision.
I'm crying. Their faces üòÇü§£üòÇ
No, just act surprised if anything comes of it. 
I mean yeah that's really it. Getting him on tape saying racist stuff is the only possibility of a sale.
Living his best life.
Would be a great pick up tbh
Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous.
Luckily for her former therapist maybe she can no longer leave her home.
[NAME] smashed some kitkats on their table for internet points. Very cool.
$390 CAD.
Good deeds don't buy off being shitty. This is why [NAME] is remembered as a monster.
I'm sorry OP but this is all on you. Your parents played you like a $4000 fiddle.
That's the point tho, they had lots of talent already, and just a couple of changes at the key spots changed everything 
Dear down voter, go to your own sub and take your childish down voting with you.

Your uncle sounds fun. RIP indeed
My friend is watching Grey's for the first time and she also got to this episode late last week. Weird.
So when I say the eagles just won a chip what would that insinuate.. not everybody has the same terminology sorry if you view my perception wrong
Man.. all I know is if I‚Äôm with a girl and she whips out a condom from her FUCKING SHOE it‚Äôs a no from me dog
Well I did have one balanced meal...before a few alcoholic beverages.
I stand corrected. I totally forgot the knee and shoulder injuries earlier in the season.
I must of not fully understood what you meant... damn tired redditing
is this real life [NAME] (netflix)?
I usually respond with ‚Äúmy body is a prison‚Äù with no explanation and people just ???? and peace out.
I'm on my third marriage. And it's been 26 years now. Sometimes a man's gotta do what a man does.
You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.
Well I will get to your disagreements. However you maybe the last FIFO worker that exists in Alberta, however, don't take it for granted. 
I'm glad you called it because it really is a beautiful and beautifully honest statement.
It‚Äôs sad that some parents can‚Äôt accept some simple mistakes.
Happiness is not earned, it is a choice that can be made once your basic needs are met.
I really like hearing the Australian accent of someone speaking Italian.
Solid as a rock!
I‚Äôm doing married. Sorry.
This and Theielens record are the two biggest highlights of the season
The last message was particularly painful to read
You're happy something is negatively affecting people as long as it isn't you? [NAME]. You probably support [NAME] too.
He s ugly and short. It's pretty clear.
True on the colder end, but their summers are not as hot because the humidity is low so it really cools off in the evenings.
The bus loop was never going to entice families to transfer their kids to city schools. Is it great for kids already there? Yes.
Yeah their passes are crazy.
Rank?
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD CONGRATS!!!!
Everybody talks about this but I wonder if it increases the chances of prostate cancer. Do you know?
Omg this made me hurt! You better of gotten a damn good back rub after that.
Double sheilds is excellent 3800 and below. Prob is, teammates dont use them
I know it's 40C over here lol
You are not intereating. You are an annoying cunt who should have never been concieved.
How was the problem resolved??? Having the same issue????
I do have a feeling [NAME] will retire while [NAME] still has a season on his contract.
There is a difference, because unless something had given them encouragement, they'd still be feeling negative about it. 
Obviously a degree in veterinary medicine, in case Mr [NAME] has the sniffles
I believe the term is grill inspector
I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
The true horror of modern democracy is enabling those who say pork roll to have a voice.
Yes, ~~jack~~ jake will be great too! Love the audio mixer with the old Spiderman soundtracks...looks very well produced...
Wish you good luck
He was! And people in my class would be so hard on him about his accent. I hear the guy teaching the class now is really good, though!
I mean some of that is probably true. What a weird situation.
Immigrants are superior -workers (leo) -taxpayers (leo) -culturally (the abbey)

[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME] and one of [NAME] or [NAME]. But I‚Äôm pretty sure all of [NAME] is under contract forever if that matters
Fuuuuck that's rough
Hey didnt say being fat and short is bad
I love her so much
Unsurprisingly our closest competitors will try to capitalise as we stumble. Good luck to them, we have brought this on ourselves. 
It is. It‚Äôs so bad. Then I start blaming myself for liking them. It‚Äôs like I have no control over this.
I wish people like this would die in massive flaming wrecks
I don‚Äôt think he forgot I think he was just really out of breath
It just kind of naturally happens. I've actually had a spontaneous switch in two different relationships, though.
Love the idea for the [NAME] skin but I think it might be too hard :/
This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.
Let‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs a thing r/unexpectedjokers Edit: why am I not surprised also first try
Not yet! But I waiting for a miracle any year now!!
Difference is that a conq forward dash bash always grants a gb when dodged but warlords charge usually leaves him out of range to punish it when dodged
It's a good thing that liopleurodon was actually only about six meters long and went extinct 155,000,000 years ago...
You are an amazing human being
Wish the teacher has spelled inventors correctly before testing the students.
That‚Äôs how I read it in the sentence but my brain reads it as ‚Äúyeahno‚Äù. Lol
I like turtles.
I do not trust our defense at all. I do not believe you can increase the range of Andujar.
Wow thank you so much for the info. I tried looking it up but couldn't find anything. Very interesting stuff
Which state? It's actually quite rare.
You came at me with attacks, so no, you get NOTHING!
by way of Real Clutch
Thank you so much! We will likely also be doing that haha :)
Weird how this shouldn‚Äôt be SFW, but it is
I mean my statement applied to more than just weed but sure...
This made me chuckle. I hope it is raptors v warriors in the finals. That‚Äôs gonna be a fun series to watch.

Everyone *can* be rehabilitated, but a lot of effort is needed, and most would likely fail.
I report them still as residences and attach a Google Street view screenshot and note that it's nothing at all
It's more like the western world is infuriated that a non-democratic Asian republic is on the trajectory to becoming the leading superpower. Case in point ^
Waddle like your life depends on it because it might. Ice is dangerous.
Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. 
Funk Night @ Marble Bar is Friday, 1/25. Always a good time and only $5 to get in.
I hate those days man... So triggering

I totally agree man I hope one day I can find that too
"My husband and I are expecting a little boy. We will refuse to do the whole ""man up"" thing. No toxic masculinity here hopefully lol"
If this is the original Thai (I think) one then I would say it was a pretty good watch. Haven‚Äôt watched any other versions
That‚Äôs a lot of damage
Yea it‚Äôs custom, me and a friend of mine were messing around seeing what we could sit on...
Hope your friend is okay.
The thing to understand about [NAME] is that he's a complete moron.
Me too :D
SCREENSHOT THIS.
that sounds disgustingly sweet and yet i want to try it
Oh, he was so wronged in ME3.
You need to stop focusing on him and focus on you and your daughter.

"It will be cool a ""Classic BF maps DLC"" on this time period. And a Stalingrad battle map <3 And a berlin map."
Ah I see, thanks. I struggle with the order of the sentences in English from time to time, so I'm glad for any help :) 
Oh fuck. Is that legal?
Right before that he called [NAME] for getting barged in the back and nearly kicked in the face. Weird performance. Didn't change the result mind
Quitting porn only helped with my performance in bed, other than that I‚Äôm still anxious as hell in social spots 
Obviously you are! Femboys are always the cutest ~~people~~ furs to meet
I'm sorry that happened. Was her hospice nurse aware that she was suffering?
Fuck you, that's how
These posts go in /r/DFWPets
Thank you for the thorough reply! I definitely can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not lucky for a long time after this.
Great point.
[NAME] I wish that was me
This is the part where we throw our heads back and laugh. Ready?
Willian wasting pressure, shocking
Thats the problem you have with this? Mule kick in zombies has exactly what he wants xD
Cant agree more on the first part but for the last, it comes out too harsh.
Until you realize immortal Trout is better...
I‚Äôm pretty sure your thinking of [NAME], although I could be wrong
Omg I love these things so much
Yes I do. Two bartenders can easily bring home $4k a month each.
can we get a power stone remake? how about dragons dogma 2?
poor mod :( i guess people arent allowed to leave this sub if they are vegan
Thank you for your vote of confidence, but we statistically can't get to 10 wins.
I fear slowly losing myself, and my cognition over an illness far more than I fear dying from a random accident tbh. 
Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them..
I used to do shit like this...back when I had a serious drinking problem I was in denial about
Reminds me of this short.
Let's go Faze. They need this here
Dude, its **life** it's not **trauma**. Grow up 
I'm surprised she could operate a suitcase.
"A ""wise"" man once told me: > DO > YOUR > OWN >RESEARCH >! "
DJ's mocks are always a little off pre combine/FA. I still really like his mocks, this one i just off to me though.
Lmao the brigading is real
[NAME] loves her kids.
We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that‚Äôs not a good argument
Lol.... i guess your personal experience explains everything.... personally I've seen this play out numerous times in the work place..... so.....
Consider this my formal request for a list of all of [NAME] lifelong dreams.
Not sure, I'm not good at expressing my feelings, and sometimes I get angry and say things that very hurtful
Anyone else getting stuck in the radio com loop with [NAME] and whoever
Which one is it?
This. Right here. This is what r/exmormon is...and it is beautiful.
The lack of teabags is the only emergency here. You thwarted an attack on your child.
Assuming you're a dude, yes, just let him watch you. But be ready to clean up the toilet seat and surrounding area a lot.
No but I've been totally been meaning to I fricking love [NAME]!
Good news. Makes me feel BCH is way underpriced and has a huge upside.
"""It's your outfit, dude."""
would be US Biggest error ever
That sounds great, I *love* Rogue One. It's also the movie that's perfectly safe for TLJ fans to despise.
Well then just ice it (if you haven‚Äôt already) and hope for the best

Monero enthusiast here. Make me happy and call me a liar again.
I remember your story. Like you, I'm not as active. And also like you, I try and come back and give folks here hope.
This is bloody disgusting.
Financial security and the happiness of close family.
This game is a pain in the ass. There are few things as infuriating as getting dicked by 3s all game. Flashbacks to the 2nd Orlando game.
17.5 i pm what i got at 18
I enjoyed the effort from your dad so I must downvote but I want the subreddit to see this so I‚Äôll upvote
Generally, yes. That doesn‚Äôt make being attractive necessary criteria for being successful and it doesn‚Äôt detract from any of your positive qualities
I would love to get microblading but its so iffy about if it‚Äôll be good or not. I‚Äôve seen a lot of terrible turn outs
I feel that way about [NAME] antis saying [NAME] and [NAME] antis saying [NAME]. But I‚Äôm also terrible and laugh every time I see it.
I doubt I'll ever own one of those, I'm a bookworm and I love the smell of old books. Thanks for the info, nonetheless.
I thought I was the only woman who felt this way. I'm glad I'm not alone.
Yeah. Basically Sky Germany and Sky Sports aren't reliable at all
Either that, or his wife is *really* attractive. 
In my school we have specific councilors for the students matched alphabetically. Mine just sucks.
How are his past career stats relevant? Dude hit below the Mendoza line last season lol [NAME] is way better
Only because you aren't as educated within the realms of the game but does that matter? No
There‚Äôs at least a thousand hallways that look exactly like that with people that look exactly like that in America
Thanks dude, speaking of the Sahara thay is how dry our texting has gotten. Any tips to spark it back up?
I had hot dogs. They were delicious, lol!
She might be a [NAME] but she ain't my Waifu ARTEMIS FOREVER SUCKERS
Everytime i see a T-Wolves game and i see [NAME] running around with the number 67 jersey on i just laugh
No, I think you posted this in the right place. I get annoyed when people say what and what isn't antinatalist on this forum. 
It did put me off at first but after you get better with a weapon it becomes far less of an issue.
[NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell. Do.you know [NAME] ign?
At least she tried to be prepared for this.
Highlights will be glorious to watch! Here‚Äôs [NAME] shootout zinger!

It‚Äôs getting so annoying
This idea is brilliant.
i envy you, I'm just stuffed with cringe
1. Keep doing exactly what we have been doing for the last 24 years. 2. Expropriate the land. 3. ?? 4. Economic growth.
This is a long shot here, but do you think we could eventually edit genes to produce longer life spans? Or maybe to stay younger for awhile?
Thank you! I‚Äôll contact you tomorrow! :)
Nah it's not that, [NAME] is just boring and sad
...Oh my
Because [NAME] is a free agent after this season so he could just leave when this season is basically a lost cause for us
Since you called me out for saying that I am defending the attacker, then just point out which sentence I wrote led you to that conclusion. 
If only. He‚Äôs signing with the red wings 100%.
You‚Äôre gonna be the best dad ever!
I‚Äôd be verrrrrrrry nervous if we hired him. Would love him as an OC tho
It looks fun as hell too, from what I can tell. I‚Äôd love to give it a whirl
> Crown Four Kingdoms thank you man :)
Your hairline is further away than [NAME] hope of gaining subscribers while still having beef with you.
Who‚Äôs fucking a shark !?
Look at the reflection of the ceiling in the mirror...and the exit sign. I totally thought this was a jerk.
That would...hurt
I love you both
Is a valid, unsound argument logical?
Uffda. What a hero.
Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.
Didn't really help who the Master is but [NAME] will lose his damn mind. We video game worlds now.
You shot my hair....
Situation in chess where it is better not to move or you will end up in a worse position is called Zugzwang.

I'm just saying you are demanding things of us while being nasty yourself.
I‚Äôll do that. Thank you
Oh don't get me wrong, there's a lot else wrong with comparing teachers to huns besides what I said.
At least you should have helped out since you had rudely interrupted him.
Try peeling from one end and carry to the other, if you just lift up then your doing it wrong
They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.
I have an issue metabolizing medications fast. I'll wake up during surgeries so they give me a lot of drugs.
You nailed it!
Do your worst. The tag just describes your views. Could have been much more vicious.
Now we all know someone is going to domesticate these cute fluff butts
Who is your least hated and absolute worst? (Outfit based only)
Nobody is forced to use pronouns by law as he's claimed, it's a blatant lie he made up to further his agenda. 
oh [NAME], the fumbles.... all the fumbles
Yeah, and the pushers can do that whether they're paid or not.
Sorry but this is too rad to be cringe for me. This is like if [NAME] was a general.
THEY ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER!!
Excuse me who the hell is that?
Now I just want to see every scene with [NAME] in it with [NAME] following him around playing the theme.
I'm just glad everything came out okay.
Good job [NAME]!
Thank you! :)
i hate that it's over an interstate bridge so people traveling from the west from other states have to look at it edit* because it's fucking corny
I think you and I think alike. Sometimes I wish I knew less of history... because ignorance can be blissful
I know, right? I mean I liked Le Tigre, but this is just damn embarassing.
I‚Äôm so proud of you for taking care of you and your babies, mama! We love you and stay strong.
I like that, will be looking forward to seeing it when I go there. Sure, it's stereotypical. Who cares?
Yeah that's funny. Girl who didn't like that is probably some [NAME] wannabe thot.
BOOM BOOM BOOM (not Bitton related)
I've been thinking about you today. I hope you are still here.
*what the fuck*
Cause emotions are difficult and people fear rejection
Can I just say that the Elizabeth Line is still a bloody stupid name, and no I don't think I'll just get used to it.
Glad you're at least out of bed. Progress!
WIFE DEAD, KARMA ALIVE
Well I can say 100% it didn‚Äôt go well.
Nice job continuing to ignore the fact she lost her home and her father at the peak of the 2008 housing crisis you obtuse prick
#But it's their looks!!!
That was juicy.
I am here to tell you that it really will work out okay! I have certainly felt like you before. It sucks to feel lonely.
Well call it aesthetics or whatever but the game hasn't made a jump graphical wise and animation wise in a long time.
But that situation is not really what you are talking about, is it?
Damn who is [NAME] pissed at?
Love is war
Oh come on! Stop posting this stuff. FFS will you think of my blood pressure!? You‚Äôre killing me (figuratively speaking).
im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
Remember to tuck and roll!
You should call the police and tell your friend maybe you can Stay over at his place
I know this is late, but I can‚Äôt believe I missed this. Love it.
I love salty popcorn. and sweet and salty popcorn. and tomato and worcestershire sauce popcorn. and chocolate popcorn... I'm just a fan of popcorn =D
I had an ex who was [NAME] and a drunk and eventually got into crack
That would be really rough. However she is so incompetent I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she self immolates
The same comedy bit [NAME] has disavowed because it's used almost exclusively in circumstances like this? It's an awful and weak explantation.
> Insert racial slur here I choked, have your upvote
Not at all. It's great of course for financial reasons, but it then makes me worried about how much time she'll have for a relationship.
No, but you wouldn't believe what I'm not tired of seeing...
At least it‚Äôs not anything worse, and that you are still close to that person :)
He doesn't seem like he has all the facts straight
Don't grab another slice of pizza. Maybe if they would've eaten the crust they would have not been so hungry. It's greedy and picky.
>implying Packers fans have ever fucked anything besides their siblings
[NAME] and [NAME] are ok because they were devout [NAME]. Like they hate secular music.. but U2 is worshipped by a lot of the 40-something [NAME].
Thanks man I will check into it.
And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.
You can't stop [NAME], you can only hope to contain him
And then we wish for winter because it's so damn hot, thus the cycle continues. 
LMAO me too! Just give us the life sentence and be done with it ü§£
I like the way your brain works OP. Always did enjoy bugs bunny humour.
You'd be stupid not to do this.
I'm so stupid, I can do this. On accident. so not very well.
It hurts to snap out of that denial and face the truth your loved ones are dead... I guess.
I love that when [NAME] was actually further left of HRC on a few issues like TPP.
the fuck is wrong with this guy
Fair enough, I respect your perspective.
Can‚Äôt imagine taking on that contract
Thank you. I thought I was going crazy for a sec.
Just start bullying the people who you're getting microagressions from. Shoulder check all of them if you have to
Thanks for recording a video message with AntiRivet like 3 years ago for me. Hope everything is going well.
Ah yes, downvoted somebody for being different. Ever acceptant.
We‚Äôre gonna need a bigger boat.
Shocking mate I know, hopefully one day they'll go home. 
I found her advice very insightful. Maybe it will be of use to
Damn. That‚Äôs profound. Did you graduate from Harvard?
I had the same thought
its north park
That is so absolutely accurate I couldn‚Äôt say it better myself.
She was a surrogate. [NAME] fucked the force which created [NAME] in schmee
Well they do say they love kids just helping create more
Lol let me do you one better, what FPS games have EVER had built in aim assist with controller on pc?

Well, Detroit isn't currently marred by ownership and front office incompetence.
Sort of like a window?
This is so scary. Keep safe! I would put fencing up and become a licensed carrier at that point. Sounds like crazy druggies!
Where do you think it belongs? Why?
I wish they would put dfs in for [NAME] right now
Free option: Look at the RAW and read the sum on [NAME]
22 but still no fucking excuse, he was a grown man who could make better decisions than that
Does us releasing him not affect this number at all?
Well, there's cubs and otters too.
Everybody seems to be lost.
I feel like I'm in a yoghurt advertisement announcing how my digestive system is all rejuvenated. Its that wholesome.
I've got no idea who you are but thanks for trying anyway.
Super fake news. This wasn't brought up when directly asked about it in previous testimony.
Unfortunately, he'll never quite see that.
I get all my cupcakes from Randalls, however I wanted to try Central Market recently but interested in how I would get scammed.
[NAME] looks so defeated every time [NAME] posts him up
Part of being an adult is putting awkward on the back burner because some things are more important and need to be said.
There has to be some repercussions for this judge, right? Considering the crimes, that bail seems incredibly low...
[NAME] led yesterday with 4 ([NAME] had 2)
Ah man I finished RDR2 twice, so decided to try out GTA V and ran into [NAME] last night! Awesome character!
The medical examiner's office was on-scene at the fire pit from the get-go......so far the investigations looks very different from the TH case.
The UK having disdain for Ireland or Irish people isn‚Äôt exactly new.
What‚Äôs crazy is when [NAME] came back [NAME] played him down the stretch instead of [NAME], [NAME] seems fed up with [NAME]. 
Lol. Exactly
Who specifically are we gonna sue? The industry! Lol
Wait what planet was this on? I dont remember ever going there
I'm so very sorry, ill say 10x [NAME] and Russia forever prayers before I go to bed
It's not a world view. It's a single position on a single subject.
okay, enjoy living in ignorance and hatred
Could be something limited to my branch too.
That is the first positive thing I‚Äôve ever read about NJ transit.
You have to leave the house.
Don't you fucken do it
Nobody likes you
The abilities look cool, but that trait is a little dull. It's almost exactly the same as [NAME].
He might assume that most people are shoplifters like him and that you're a nuisance to society that he's exposing.
Please elaborate on that story! Ive always been afraid of exactly this happening to me.
he was stellar the Memphis game down the stretch. honestly forgot about that
really odd choose with pairing slack and sunfan together. These 2 should always be paired with a high IQ caster

There is always the risk of a team throwing him a stupid offer sheet. I still wish we would've thrown a max at [NAME].
Ah, the good old days where you could lose in a game! Yes!
Cleavage: Nature's Brass Catcher.
Just a heads up that‚Äôs not what neoliberalism is.
I hope your life is as lovely as you are
Too hungry for that money.
Ahh. Both of those are very good. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
"They're not ""likes"" you fucking moron."
WHOSE READY TO PLAY A WILD CARD GAME AT THE TROP
Haven't you seen any horror movie!? Those cats are saving you from certain doom
How many hours of maintenance do they really need to do every night? I feel like they just want to cut costs and tell us it's impossible.
Is it that good ? i'd need it too in that case :(
I‚Äôm aware but you won‚Äôt see the Turkish state broadcaster promoting that filth.
I hope [NAME] makes a full recovery.
[NAME] was absolutely awful in 15.
Probably wouldn't hurt to delete this post and pretend it never was posted.
Lol! Nope. Any muscle in your body will shrink if yiu dont use it.
Ooooo that boy is going *down*
The surprise would be that we just broke a 16 year old record...
1. Why is it impossible to not read this in [NAME] voice? 2. Why does it get in my head so [NAME] damn often?
It makes more sense now.
There's absolutely no question personality effects the outcome of an interaction, however a personality can not make up for lack of physical attraction.
Thank you so much :)
I think you're missing a /s
Sksksksk omg, I think I must‚Äôve got confused then, yeh top for ep8 right? And that‚Äôs the makeover or the ball?
"But ""[NAME] knows the heart! The baby will be in heaven."" Yeah....."
Thank you! I am surprised with the amount of feedback I am getting. I was not careful with my word choice.
I sit on one of my legs. I always have my other leg weirdly sticking out. Like I‚Äôm trying to crouch, but failing.
It would be a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Sorry I'm a reddit noob but why do I get notifications of comments on my thread but then they disappear and I can't read them? Lol
Nope, not a [NAME] fan at all.
Nah, I think that was a bass lick
Well now I think I was wrong
Wow, ouch... 
Uhh...weird flex but ok?
got enough rubies üòÅ librals wouldn't know what saving is even if it hit them in the face! üá∫ üá∏üòéüá∫ üá∏
You're going to have to make that simpler for my tiny brain to understand
No, the full video shows that the kids surrounded and berated the native elder man 
Hey I thought she was cute the whole time. I was also 12 though and she cute.
Thank you so much, kind stranger. I really need that
On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.
"Basic translation ""I'd rape you if I weren't a virgin!"" Super creepy."
Man I didn't think our fanbase was this delusional.
This physically hurt me
One of the best pubs in London. Even more likely inside!!
Good to know! We didn't get any when we went Friday evening, but we can try again.
Midland has a ton of smart people. A lot of petroleum engineers.
[NAME]. Please, [NAME]. 
I really want to know what the coordinates he gave him are
You‚Äôd be surprised how often that works though
Unfortunately, I don't. Sorry. üòî
I love how that's pretty much all they can do, literally beg for him not to run.
They wouldn't be entirely wrong...I know I'm certainly fatigued with the way Doctor Who has been going for a while now.
Damn, politics *does* make strange bedfellows.
Isn‚Äôt it against company policy to sell things in the store that have nothing to do with Starbucks
If someone starts that, I‚Äôll join in. Their mods help perpetuate it all.
Id rather have them be physically ok and make amends with [NAME] later than have one without the ability to communicate efficiently forever but have their feelings alright.
I like #5 too she is slacking on her end of that bargain, she‚Äôll leave [NAME] before she ever sleeps with him. 
You‚Äôll love r/2healthbars
[NAME] Edit: but certainly LP deflated there
So i'm intrigued how the fusion would be
My most sincere condolences.
Yeah I'm gonna do that....Thank you...she just doesn't like the feeling of condoms but i dont care need to put my foot down
Right? Considering it‚Äôs such an important document, I should know the damned thing backwards and forwards... thanks again for the help!
My comment wasn't aimed at you... try to relax
I want him to change and realize he messed up and he needs to do better
But why tho
its ok, glad i watched the show, i enjoyed it.
Wow, *only* 7 exes. You are definitely FA.
Watch your back u/Youareapooptard, [NAME] might hunt you down and burn you alive for that relatively minor insult
I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
To bad for you.
Will they ever stop?? FLG is a cult.
The reason I was commenting was because the other day i was reading threads about how it's annoying that the ocs doesnt do the bulk discounts
Yeah, because not paying a bill on time is equal to murdering children. 
That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta.
Tbh that‚Äôs kind of the exact player we need...
Ill try my best. I can atleast try and looksmatch at 5'6. AlphaM is 5'6.
What is your final solution for Snowflakes?
Ahhh India. Where she would have been raped 17 times on her daily commute.
Thank you ! I thought it was funny guess no one else noticed it or thought it was funny:/
That's why everyone loves you, you're a joke club. 
Thanks for the support
To calm him down I suppose.
"Its kinda odd,how theres always kinda a war between ""Party music"" and ""Feelings Music"""
Glossing over [NAME] doesn't do justice to how crippled my team was after picking him
you can anything you want when you have jordan bone
sorry. emotional writing bot! you dont know what its like to have an amygdala! lol
I‚Äôm fine with that. I‚Äôm happy to be banned from subs like that.
I don't care it's amazing there lol
Ok thanks bro for the opinion. I‚Äôm trying to settle a argument.
All the ladies can stay at my place.
If someone asked me, ‚Äúwhat truly stood out to you as a memory from this year,‚Äù my mind would be completely blank.
Happens every time. Your just playing the with your sibling and then someone accidently hits the other and it turns in to world war 3.
Most people are unfamiliar with them and fooled by the deceptive name. My money is on no.
Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back.
well put yourself in his shoes though, it could make for a possible hostile working environment as well as be detrimental to his livelihood.
You're in for a treat- enjoy :)
Ohh looking cool Jok- Get out of here side character.
Just like demar used to do lol
Your adventure begins, They were always beside you
Are you serious?
This is funny, although... Some people just can't take a yolk. 
oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.
Exactly. Stop talking and let the adults speak u/MeatheadVernacular.
$20k - $30k is not an unrealistic sum. It would cost that much and more just to sell or house.
You‚Äôre the one who is stupid
Happens way too often
I'm down for cuddling too uwu ^(especially since cuddling can lead to sucking OwO)
Imagine thinking this comment was ok to post. Shame on you.
This dude was super cool
I only know of [NAME], but she's said there are others. 
good to know. thanks!
I wish I would get dm‚Äôed by famous people :(
Yes, thank [NAME] the wisest of [NAME] live outside your country
Every time, lots of people overwhelm me. I have light sensitivity to florescents so that doesn't help. 
I think it's even sadder to go through someone's Reddit account looking for stuff like this to post.
Depending on your specs. Insurgency sandstorm is my go to game. Coop is also a blast.
What are you gonna do when your 150 years old and a giant angry bird won't stop trying to kill you?
I'm amazed people read BuzzFeed articles.
[NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
That should usually be the giveaway‚Äîthough they now wear these ridiculous waist-high tights to hide the fact they don‚Äôt have workout bodies either.
It's holiday time here in Europe. Today is my first day in work for 2 weeks.
"As my grandma used to say, ""When she dies, they'll say there lies the truth, 'cause it never left her."""
All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
I‚Äôm shocked that no one got whooshed by this comment
Just got my nose pierced last week! So fun to have the freedom. :)
I love her omg
I know the feeling, but you‚Äôre not disgusting. Happy new year!
Now it just looks like she has a cape...
Thanks for the encouragement and sharing. It is nice not looking at it every 2 hours!
Who are you and how did you know I was watching GOT while I was typing that?
I think that's what I'm going with. Thanks guys! u/krazyM
dude, that's [NAME] or [NAME]
wow. thank you. you dont know how badly i needed that tbh
Yea, it's a waste of bullets. 
What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
I bet he took down his USA flag to put this one up instead lol
> But I still hope natal males will respect natal women's spaces.. They don't. I would hope they would but they don't.
You're a clown. What gives you confidence that anything takes place ever?
No, the best thing is to do cool stuff with care. That's what science is. You don't learn if you don't do stuff.
I love it. The only thing faker than their lies is them. I‚Äôm glad the girl was able to get her divorce.
This would, honestly, imo, be a better response than what we've gotten so far. 
[NAME] was their best player
And if they can't find US suckers to give them cheap labor with desired skills, they'll simply replace you with an imported indentured laborer from India.
Interesting situation. You're actually supporting a strong awesome woman, but everyone who sees you is just gonna think you're a misogynistic psycho.
Yes, a lot of it 
This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on here, and that scares me.
Katy/cypress area is just as bad if not worse in some areas. Luckily we only saw one driver obviously drunk but there were several wrecks. Be safe everyone
For be just being a handsome guy works wonders.
Don't worry looking for it, there isn't any porn tab/hidden message
Make sure the kids layer up. And make sure you layer up, too.
Reminds me [NAME] club idea eclipse. Only open 2hrs once a year. $5000 cover charge.
I have a cold too üòø. Hope you feel better!
I can‚Äôt wait for him to file bankruptcy. His legendary move.
Maybe they mean like older kid free? I'd contact the coordinator and ask them if your baby is okay.
Any more comments calling me SWERF for caring about sex workers will be blocked and reported I s2g
Super fucking lucky
No where was I blaming [NAME] for the lose but he didn‚Äôt help. I just dislike his game.
This is brilliant.
Don‚Äôt you want to raise awareness, you need to do at least one chiro out there who is in need of immediate care).
Yeah, hopefully the lesson learned from this is that our level of airport security is stupid and unnecessary and not that [NAME] is risking another 9/11 
Honestly, that would be my nightmare, I‚Äôd rather keep [NAME] another season and draft a new QB in 2020 instead 
I hardly ever post in r/bitcoin. But then, r/Bitcoin isn't pretending Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
This is the most horrifying thing I've ever read on this thread. May you and your loved ones see this through safe and sound.
Put away the screen and go outside. You'll feel much better.
Lol ok. So saying a garbage clip doesn't belong at the top of a gaming subreddit makes me a [NAME].
Yup, playing in to his hands now. If you link all his comments then you legitimise his complaint about stalking.
if it wasn't him it would be someone else she's wasting her life on
I don't see how this is relevant to this subreddit? Perhaps try your local political subreddit.
As far as I know, she offered quick snack to all of them, just out of obligation and two of them accepted that.
Yeah, it‚Äôs not exactly rocket-propelled hot wheels cars playing soccer, but eh, I‚Äôm down.
I've seen this about 10 times on Reddit in the past hour. Stop.
"Seriously. ""Haha british people pronounce something funny"" ""Yeah well your children are murdered in violent attacks and your healthcare system puts millions in crippling debt"" "
This is so sweet üñ§
The Citadel has given us much to be thankful for.
That's interesting, thank you. I'll mention it to the psych when I see them next.
They do realize that the guy in the first picture is from a musical that mocks the [RELIGION] religion right?
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the hurt, this shit sucks so bad.. I don‚Äôt wish this upon anyone..
Bitch real man just panicking purchases a m82 barret..Now excuse me while i hide from my wife for the next month.

i think he did. of course i‚Äôm not sure since it didn‚Äôt happen to me but to a close friend
yeah but like I‚Äôm highkey anxious about getting shocked and screw Apple for getting rid of the rainbow logo, it was so cool
Uh... What's stopping you from just throwing it away?
> punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...
Sadly no... I‚Äôm in Delaware üò©. But I‚Äôd love to help in any way I can. Keep me posted. 
It sometimes works on yoda doing the same thing, hilarious seeing that wee dude fly 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I laugh so I don‚Äôt cry :‚Äô)
Hope you don't touch the menus, they're the filthiest thing in any restaurant. 
Your response is truly one of the most amazing ones I‚Äôve seen.
Why does every comment here have at least one reply that is like an essay long
My bad. Was half asleep while typing and couldn‚Äôt remember how to spellüòÇ I just let autocorrect take over, thanks! Lol
I was waiting for this comment
Mr [NAME] is operater as fuck
This is dank what the hell
You two are on lists now.
There is a huge hormone dump around 48-72 hours after birth. Totally normal. Take care of yourself, eat well, and get some rest.
Haha I‚Äôm not expecting anything at considering they‚Äôre 2,000 miles away from me. I‚Äôll be surprised if she does give me numbers,
I wanna see this line up... not cause I think we‚Äôll win with them but i just want to see it. [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
alright, make it!
I heard of people doing that in the dorms freshman year and hadn't thought of it since. People said it worked.
genuinely funny - downvoted
Ah thank you! I just remembered it the way I said. Was never sure if that's what it meant.
Great tip, thanks for this. Always just assumed I either used print screen, or the snip tool for copying specific things on screen.
Let me rephrase what was said above: You should do some research from sources biased towards science.
None. If she has insecurities, I latch onto them like a barnacle.
Wow, y'all are heroes! 
So sorry to hear that matey. What a good dog. Give him lots of pets.
Nope, if i remember correctly it was a modded gibson les paul, i'm not a guitar player though
I had a friend from Palestine who became atheist. I don‚Äôt know how many atheists in Palestine there are but I wish there were more!!
This really is next level
When asked about my hopes for the Wild, i always (half) jokingly say, ‚Äúi hope my grandkids can see them raise their first Cup‚Äù
Also curious. But as someone who lives in northern Ontario, this is pretty accurate
BANG motherfucker!
All news sites have reels ready for high profile people that are older or sick. Still tasteless to see
Since i have no one i choose u op to reach out to I love you fellow human pls always smile friend have the happiest of lives
I hope he doesn't
The game is pretty fun with items tho. Just obviously too random for esports
She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy. 
Hopefully they can bounce back and take out the anger of this loss on the pistons, then start a new win streak
The only time you're personal behavior should be on the governments radar is when it becomes harmful to others.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking.
I have no advice, but I can commiserate, and offer hugs.
Only blurred photos, but could be something I suppose. Here's to hoping
WHO WON THIS FIGHT My thoughts: neither side did a good job at explaining their positions and this entire interview was mostly useless
Any that lands for us tbh lol

What crap An issue with developing on byte ball is that no one knows what the bloody hell byte ball is
You're just lonely, dude. Don't mix that feeling with love.
I'd love for some kind of throwback jersey game with [NAME] wearing the old-style goalie cage mask ala [NAME].
Hahaha this is gold
Mate you are mental, no way [NAME] would mess up like you have said!
>You can't purge dissenting opinions over there like you do here. Yes, because top minds definitely doesn't purge dissenting opinions. 
Get your feet off the table...
Because he doesn't need to compensate for anything.
Just to set up for a bigger failure story in the coming days. I think the guys at epoch times are working extra hours this weekend.
Don‚Äôt be so negative. Living like a medieval peasant is easy in today‚Äôs world.
That windshield crack from his skull!
No steel toe boots either. Amateurs. If the owner made his cooks do this instead of proper contractors he deserves a workers comp claim.
Am I the only one that wants to see your art?? I love calligraphy! You might have a client here!!
[NAME] reference.
In what ways has [NAME] out-coached [NAME]? I see this all the time and yet never any examples.
Become proficient with firearms and learn a second language if your in the us I'd suggest spanish
Not practicing with the team, seems like a bad sign for playing today. 
You would be floored to hear how many times I played Portal 2...
Was there ever a PPV main event with [NAME] vs [NAME]?
Yeah, this belongs on r/wholesomememes
back when mercy could get play of the game.. and not be useless.
Hmmm, I knew of the change but is ops post karma increasing? It doesn't look like it on their profile
Being with someone else means nothing, he seems like he might be abusive in the future. You did the right thing cutting him off.
Cheers for the recommendation nonetheless, will have a look!
Sorry, the two different names made me thing those were two different places. ^ ^;
That's amazing! I think that's great! I wish you the best in 2019! Please keep us updated!
a PG that shoots 41% on free throws? pass. would much rather have jrue if we're shitposting
I‚Äôm fully onboard with you there, I was more commenting that to get the liberals in this sub thinking, since ACAB gets downvoted into oblivion 
Please go to youtube and leave a comment and share :) Happy new year!!!
Oh trust me, I thought of that - but I felt as though the phallic shape would cheapen the resemblance to feces 
My cat just attacked me for treats and scratched me on the finger. If this affects my typing, he's in so much trouble.
Competitive Deathmatch was a huge reaper fest last season :( Had many games where everyone was reaper except maybe two people
What an amazing guy.
He is a brave man to even have the courage to put this foundation on his face. I wouldn't have even if [NAME] told me to!
Haha thanks for the warning but we met with her irl before :D
"And for your daily dose of ""Saints LoL Meme"" you are still welcome at r/falcons we wont stop in the forseeable future ^^"

"I do that anytime I see something pointy. I'm just like, ""I wonder how it would feel to stab my eye with that."
Ending the quarter with some point [NAME] action, I love it 
*What* exactly *are* we *italicizing* so *much* for?
Remember, we created gods in our image. 
I know, this weekend was absolute worse case scenario 
Man this family looks like they‚Äôre straight outta hope country from far cry 5
I was just scrolling down and I screamed when I got to the feet
What a methy situation!
Honestly, whatever kills the hangover. I do bacon mac n cheese and a spinach smoothie. Weird combo, I know. 
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** gum_sticks! ^(hug)
Is that good or bad?
What really got [NAME] bigger that much?
May the fleas of a thousand camels infest their armpits.
She was probably suspended to protect her from the angry mobs protesting outside the school edit: here's a better article
hhhh, lol 
Hi dying, I'm dad!
Have you actually found the last honest orthodontist out there?
Forget the prison, use his own guns on him. 
Wow! If they were to follow that logic, they would have to ask why on earth we were given doctors! Insanity.
OF COURSE. I TOO LIKE EYEBROWS
I'm told I look like [NAME] with a ponytail but I wanna look like [NAME]
I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
> Well maybe I dodged an argument with an idiot From the sounds of it I'm almost positive you did. Have a good one :)
Nah, she cute dawg. 
Yeah, I don't blame you! Anything to keep a shred of sanity. 
So... are you for private businesses doing what they want or not?

Picked up my new glasses. Does anyone else feel nauseous after getting a new prescription
Happy Cake Day Ph_Dank! Today is your day. Dance with fairies, ride a unicorn, swim with mermaids, and chase rainbows.
Do not make them clear,you do not have to.Women should be able to figure out things for themselves.If they can't,you need to move on.
I think it opens at 9.5 to get these sucker early hype bets and then falls once the public money tapers off
Lmao stopping a tracking working dog haha.
Agreed. Everything she did was bad. She didn't anything good at all. Edit: Grammar.
we can move on when you answer the questions that i have for you are you ready to do that?
I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt take bad news lightly. I‚Äôm sorry bud :/
Now I get why his videos are always on this sub. He's posting them himself.
Hurts donuts are dry. i love the toppings and suffer through the bottom 90% of the donut, really not worth it. 
What could it cost? $10?
Somehow this hurt more than the Saturday game.
The chick that got out right before him literally said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat if the elevator starts and I get snapped in half‚Äù üôÑ
Had to have my knee drained after a meniscus injury. It remains the most pain I've ever felt. Hopefully hers wasn't that bad
She's a female [NAME] at this point. She gets paid $30k per day for this garbage.
This is the worst advice I've ever read. You should be ashamed for posting it.
I hate how much I love these and the Banquet brownies. Only redeeming part.
Best post ever
Rice grad here, can confirm, am owl.
Wow. That was deep. I hope you make out well move on and find true love. Be strong
I have never noticed dread doing shady stuff. Dream, well, duh.
The name he asked if I was, was some foreign name. It was so far off from my actual name I thought it was a joke at first 
i hope i can go my way to my fullest potential one day^^
Too slow, I already found it ;) It is a great ad though.
Funny part is, having financial issues is a reason why someone wouldn‚Äôt be able to get that job. Isn‚Äôt that hilarious?
My cat stole my KFC once. I stole his ability to be inside for the day.
[NAME], [NAME], bible, all of it is combined in my mind.
I have 1200 hours and the highest i‚Äôve ever been was silver elite. I should probably quit this game.
Just let [NAME] run it as a FB
It doesn't bother me for some reason, I'm just lactose intolerant.
You are alone and touching her...that is a glaring sign!
OK thanks üòÇ I just typed she automatically and then realized I had actually no idea if she was a she hahaha
Another italian word could be added to that brexit context. Comedia dell arte.
Not exactly a question but thanks for all you did on the Mets.
Thanks, didn‚Äôt know there was a term for it. That‚Äôs how I handled the first and last episode I saw lol
Yup, not anymore. Keep your blood sugar up! It really helps and DRINK water...
That's what mine did with Mortal Kombat back in the day.
Did you even read the article? It's 1 anecdote and she wants to return because she misses her family.
That's a good idea, I'm going to have to make some room! Thank you. 
That shit really just made my night. Haha
Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?
The lesson is to not take 4 Ambien. That is just stupid.
Genuinely laughed really hard
This is horrifying
Yes. But it‚Äôs still KFC so there‚Äôs a long way to go.
The first resonates with me much more than the second.
Nah man presses, but good ones... the pharma kalmas are long gone bro, here in Australia anyway
you‚Äôre beautiful
I think the 90 day rule applies to increases over 5%?
You have a nice bro.
Exactly! When the mom went to kekeing in [NAME] face to FaceTime with [NAME] in all of 10 minutes my jaw fell to the floor!
I understand that the fear that you will need to have surgery is very upsetting. But, there is no legal case here. 
Its much better. Inhaling burned particulate plant matter is very bad.
Makes sense. Interesting perspective.
She does't even go here
You're the best !
That depends, some are only on low t doses with shit genetics while others are blasting tren with their break fast
Or maybe he does, and that‚Äôs why he scared of people thinking that; he‚Äôs afraid of people finding them out.
dang... that's just crazy.
No, it's not. If they grow in the wrong way then they can become extremely painful and cause discomfort. People usually like chewing freely
Ya'll are way too hard on cops. Did you know that 60% of cops don't beat their spouse? That's more than half!
Damn how I wish [NAME] was there just to see his reactions to [NAME] questions üòÇüòÇ
I know you're trying to play devil's advocate but [NAME] doesn't hit close to as well as [NAME]
how are your trolls really this bad
[NAME] promotes [NAME]. She is now [NAME].
malicious intentions? what are you talking about?
Hey, [NAME] isn't *that* annoying
Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet.
What a joke
That glass woulda broken the truck ha
ohhh....
Go easy on your mom; this letter sounds like it was written from a place of deep love.
And..the reality of it hurts
I had a second date yesterday with such bad breath! I gave him a pass on the first date because we met online.
This is amazing!
Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
It goes away and can be treated. Once treated it would never return until she had another child.
Yes. They don't care about the will of the people anyway.
In this case, I am really not so sure!
If I remember correctly, you can't edit a title. I'm not on the official reddit app though.
I enjoy it as well, there's dozens of us!
They didn‚Äôt even ask about her in the phone call. Does that not seem just a tiny bit odd to you? HONEST ANSWER PLEASE
Well I WISH SOMEONE WOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT
yeeey [NAME], My purpose has been fulfilled Now I must go
I hope it sticks for a while. I don‚Äôt have super even skin but I can‚Äôt stand wearing foundation.
All of the ones regular people have, just applied in a more logical way I guess. 
Don't even bother with him lol. He's a mindless sexist, doesn't believe facts at all lmao
Are you top or bottom? I need to go under you real quick I'm gonna need you to take him on bar
I have completely lost my voice this period. This has been an insane 11 minutes of play
I want to end myself when it happens
That‚Äôs adorable! I hope they stick with it!
To be fair, I‚Äôm not slaughtering my own food 
Is [NAME] back on his meds? This is really calm by his normal standards.
No. EDIT: Shoutout to the fat nerd who downvoted every comment in this thread just because we don‚Äôt stan the dancing games lmao
Kill whitey!
That guy was definitely in the process of starting a cult.
Yous offered the guy a contract and he rejected you. Probably couldn‚Äôt afford him lol
It's so sad
What if [NAME] shows up? I heard he loves Mexican food.
You can get a penta from 30 seconds after the quad.
üò• I feel so sorry. He'd be proud of you. *Hugs*
Pretty normal! I have a friend who is exactly the same :)
Someone really needs to solve the problem of how to put cars into video games, I'd love to see it one day, just imagine the fun!
Do you have the link to that ? I would love to hear the story from him
How disgusting. Those vile people can burn in hell!
Only time anyone hears of Antifa is when you guys bring it up.
Funding was never the problem of Mass Effect. EA is. You're confirming their bad business strategy.
I dont understand this personality thing? Most guys aren't that interesting but they will still end up with a girl.
[NAME] looks like [NAME]
> He is not sexist and not a transphobe. I see you've never actually listened to him or read his work.
no wonder i never noticed because i skip the pilot everytime i restart the series
"Love him! ""Thank You God"" is one of my favorites of his."
Well I'm scared as shit let's hope for the best, benz should be back(?)
Wrecking Ball clips are the best
Ah, didn't read the comment that way, my bad
Honestly, they changed writers and it's been pretty good so far, maybe one or two not great episodes this season.
I've seen AOCs ridiculous proposals
Not really, it can bind *itself* (though not future incarnations) otherwise none of the laws would mean anything.
That is so adorable. Her username as well.
And you get a gold! and you get a gold!! and you get a gold!!!
So. He is such a premature ejaculator that he goes before someone can take a breath? That's just amazing.
Theres a pretty big Irish population in Edinburgh/ Glasgow as well that'll likely end up contributing to the support.
[NAME] is trying not to laugh through his lines and hoesntly I love it.
THIS IS THE JOKE
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** aerosvision! ^(hug)

Fuck reddit.
You're right, thank you.
I absolutely did and loved every minute of it. I really do hope it gets more seasons
To be fair, [NAME] told her he had a gf. Also, barn girl tried to kill him. Very different situation. 
Thanks for explaining it to me! I did have an adaptor thing to connect to HDMI, I will double check tonight
Yes my man
There are a few. I've gotten a couple messages. Thanks for the support but people judging my throwaway account... who cares?
Go down there and save the world then mother [NAME].....
how'd you know? they're soooo good
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking too, so I may just go with the referral after all. Thanks again for the help!
Nah no one can help me
And the USMC get their crayons in a basket.
She‚Äôs trying to motivate him to have a normal life after prison. She‚Äôs just not doing it the right way.
What happened??
I sent this to my mom and she actually watched it
The fact that you stayed this long really doesn‚Äôt but the blame on him, you chose this relationship 
I support the most likely to win left wing option, you rather that [NAME] wins? 
Thanks a lot!
Exactly all I hear is about [NAME] and [NAME] and nothing about [NAME] it is crazy.
I am whelmed
Not all men harass women, but enough of them are that all women have *been* harassed by men.
Only about 1/10 uses is appropriate. The other 90% of the time context makes it obvious and an otherwise good joke is ruined.
What if she‚Äôs also the franchise owner who likes to get to know her customers better?
If she is an INFJ they can be quite caustic and verbally abusive at times.
Ah it's the old one. First I can remember! Of course not the first. Or the last. Hard to keep track at times...
He‚Äôs a douche because... why? He got turned on by some animal porn? Why does that make him a douche?
You‚Äôre a life saver, wish you a blessed new year 
That‚Äôs a statement I can actually get behind. Not because of anything he‚Äôs really done, but that Scientology stuff is... weird.
Banner price is down to 100k donuts. And I still don't have enough..... (sad face)
Yeah whether or not an animal is cute is pretty subjective, I was just in a bad mood when I wrote the post honestly.
Facebook is currently under fire for allegedly inflating their user base statistics by up to 50%. I'm not surprised they are having issues tracking money.
Most importantly, their first bill was to reopen the government. Period. I won't bother insulting you because I feel sorry for you.
Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins 
Thank you :D
Happy cake day man!!!
First season got a lot of attention. I didn‚Äôt like the second season as much
People more interested in kids and safety than making their books look good.
Original post is here: post
Just asked my 8 year old that goes to public school. He says they still say it.
I love your comment...
Escape and after some time then die, this is a pretty bad advice so just don't do it
üòÇ Lmao your mom‚Äôs revenge is pro-level and I love it.
Yeah. You probably dint [NAME] the cut. Sorry :-(
What are public sector wages like in the Nordics? Genuinely don't have the foggiest.
If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this.
If you are feeding your two year old 1200 calories then you are fattening them up for the stew lady.

If the ps5 ends up having ps3 backwards compatibility I'll come back to this post to taunt you.
Nope! But happy for you‚ù£Ô∏è
I think transparency was the right move here. The guy ghosted you for a while anyway so it doesn't seem like much of a loss.
Thanks, and play ball!
I‚Äôm uncomfortable just looking at her.
Kerastase. Redken is pretty good, too. 
Crocodile tears.. üôÑüêä
[NAME], this really is stunning
I've never read an article that made me experience both disgust and schadenfreude in equal measure like this one has.
Happened to me today...ended my shift early.
That was [NAME] not [NAME]
Just don‚Äôt be born on a raped planet. Jeez why do you damned virgeens make such a fuss?
Thanks, it was no effort at all.

He was injured in real life, watch the news. He'll be back in ep 15 and fully recovered.
This is an incipient antivaxx community, I don't want to see them lobbying and increasing in numbers like in the USA or Romania
My favorite pairing now is [NAME] and [NAME]. There's nothing else good. Of course I Like [NAME] and [NAME] too but I miss [NAME] so much
I‚Äôll take one [NAME] please
Great album! üëä
He's not had a great season but Athletic in general has been a shitshow this season (and last) so no real surprise there.
Yeah I think I'll just push her away, thank you.
The only way this is OK is if their kid made it for them. But then you feel bad for the kid. Lose lose..
I second that. A broader mobilization and awareness would go a long way.

Hey, did you know that killing family pets, is indicative of future serial killers? 
Holy shit did this sub just get wholesome for a second?
If a greedy and powerful few can make a buck they will.
Oh so that‚Äôs what you are into huh?
I don't believe no one in your class thought of Mac or iPhone.
Yeah, you're getting points. Bring your insurance documents as well just to save yourself the trip back. They will ask for them.
Okay I can see why that is one glorious beard
No problem, just wait until March and the site will be out.
Thanks for the clarification, appreciate that.
Also the referee can send off a ballboy if he feels like they've committed an offence worthy of that.
I‚Äôm this close to buying a tweezer and doing my own eyebrows but I‚Äôm fully aware it‚Äôs the masculinity stopping me lmao.
Imagine if you lived here and these people were your parents. Welcome to my reality.
Seriously doubt it will be Knights of Ren, but that would certainly be a great way to get people excited and build hype.
Reminded me of this Bizarro comic.
.....still thinking of something.....
Omg, maybe best plot twist. I wish that will happen
You're not really pissing anyone off. Mostly we just pity you.
I'm not a gamer but I always feel bad if I kill an ant or some other bug like that for no reason :( instant regret
Glad to see [NAME] are finally admitting they are babies who are unable to take care of themselves.
Ok. Believe what you want. Have fun starving to death.
After awhile I didn‚Äôt see anything, just emptiness. Is this article online somewhere? Would very much like to give it a read.
so did that one guy outside of AT&T :)
It would be an atrocity to bring him back, I think the F.O will be forced to bring in someone else.
Thank you for your input! I‚Äôll look into it
Never seen stone abbreviated, so was a bit puzzled. 
Jolex because [NAME] grated on my nerves so bad
Read divorce busting and kill all marriage counselors. As much as it sucks...youve been given a gift by him giving you time.
now thats a good use for a glue gun
Should‚Äôve dumped coke all over her right after the movie, and make a run for it. Fk pettiness 
[NAME] is bae, how dare you.
Rape cases are up in Chicago too. It's just a reflection of more people reporting them rather than there actually being more rapes.
I want to know what goes through someone's mind when they do this.
Well technically Point A is where you're starting from. So It can be both Home and Work.

I just tell myself that I'll be put together for some girl. She won't have to treat me like a fixer upper.
How long have you two been together? Have you talked with your bf about any of these concerns?
Oof lmao sorry buddy
Why would you assume he wasn‚Äôt in on the decision?
Le sigh, yes... or I'm [NAME] would have gone to another team... ;)
That's fine I'll still be here calling out your ridiculousness regardless.
Srs I saw this post and I‚Äôm confused that this is considered a hack.
good luck with the interview!

Awesome. Never get sick of hearing stories like that

We got heated toilet seats here in Japan. Big smiles.
What‚Äôs the backup lol?
Nailed it! I'm sorry you've had to deal with it. This whole mess sounds awful.
I love this. Thank you
No kidding, one way or another they'll get much better this year.
Yeah that pass
If they are going to do this why not just have individual bathrooms with locks on the doors.
Oh I haven‚Äôt even found those! That‚Äôs hilarious though.
This is so scary but I would love to go there. And it is actually in Brazil

Since it's a very unlucky case i would tell you to just have a really big amount of pacience and maybe have a date once a time
Broke and jealous

Damn, chairs can communicate with eachother now? What a time to be alive!
Being in a 3 person friend group fucking sucks sometimes m8 I feel like the least loved a lot of the time
I pray to [NAME] that we will be aware of people's sins in the afterlife when we watch them burn.
I loved coming across this today! Nice work!!
Be prepared for a child support order. But my dad just decided he didn't want to pay any more and the CSEA was ok with that.
My god i thought he just hit his shins really hard on the pole but than realised what his shoulders did...
I hope you're ok, I feel this post :( big hugs from me
He doesn‚Äôt have to say anything, [NAME] needs to keep these things private.
Is he really your buddy if you have to ask us how to talk to him?
It kills me how much Oklahoma State and Iowa State are able to beat KU but [NAME] and [NAME] just couldn‚Äôt regularly get the job done.
the left is still running with the its ok these boys are evil because white ya didn't think they'd change their platform now did ya?
Oh man first game of the split and I already came in my pants :/ . GG TSM
I'm sure she values you more than money. At least give talking to her a chance before you do this, you should explore your options before committing
Playoffs are the most important games... hence why [NAME] is considered to be the best *regular season* QB and not the best
Now you'll be more cautious of that in the future. Lessons were learned today son.
I binged that podcast in about 2 days at work. Amazing. The convention for Limelight, and how emotional they got for those poor women was heartbreaking.
Thank [NAME] I don't have any friends
I can't say I know enough about the sport. Very possible though.
This is one of my favorite threads ever.
Thank you so much, fehduhp! I will tell her this. 
So that's what happened to [NAME].
The cost of centralized mandatory services is an example of socialism driving up prices. Get your facts straight.
I'd like to apologize on behalf of all Azwel mains.
Agreed but I‚Äôll still take kpins if they‚Äôre available

not sure why your rhetorical question got downvoted.
I wish I could upvote this a million times. What a wonderful tack to take.
STOP GETTING FACTS FROM [NAME] AND THE CORRUPT STATE ..lol
Keep Yourself Safe, Sweetie.
"i forgot to point out that for ""spamming"" i mean ""keep using"", not as in ""spamming sigs""."
Yeah I laughed when I remembered it. Random.
"Bring them into your home, feed them, love them and have a sign made that says ""cat sanctuary"" and hang it above your front door. "

I‚Äôd smile back at you
True dat. I‚Äôm an AFC guy, but I‚Äôm even more an AFC West guy. Send the [NAME] home, Chefs!

Definitely.... I wake up at like 3am work at 6am... I hate morning people though LMAO
wow, we really live in future
Thanks, dude. It means a lot : ) Hope you have a great week.
In draft I see a lot of enchantress. Even without Enchantress if Lodestone Demolition gets 6 dmg(same as Lightning Strike) I am happy.
My condolences, cheese is magnificent!

Regardless of bonus size I'd argue it was ProRevenge. It's a coordinated effort between multiple people that had a real financial effect on the target
The SNP were, I remember [NAME] stridulating about it at conference, but I don‚Äôt think it was a go-er.
Like this isn‚Äôt even an attempt at a joke. It‚Äôs just two statements. Holy brain dead inta ‚Äúmemes‚Äù.
yea ok dude
I legitimately cannot understate on how much I hate [NAME].
I mean, sept is a prefix for seven. Even if it isn‚Äôt the right one for that problem...
Source leads to artist‚Äôs Twitter page and post :3

I'm critical of halal, but I also don't eat meat. None of it is humane.

How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s
He has been training for this 5k for about 20 years
Ooooh that was a missed opportunity
I have a solid plan in place, definitely not an impulse decision. Just curious about other people‚Äôs experiences. 
Thanks for the breakdown [NAME].
Imagine bragging about a ‚Äúyour mum‚Äù joke
I dont think anyone liked 6A apart from the two Slade episodes and the crossover. Most people here consider it to be sloppy
I like it! I think the ideas of [NAME] can go a long way. I wish you the best of luck :)
Not even the original
Good Job
[NAME] is the only reason I‚Äôm sane after watching this season
Which will happen.
oohh, that makes a lot more sense now, thank you kindly
This almost certainly should not have gone to OT. SEC refs are bad CBB refs are bad
If we‚Äôre not taking QB then we‚Äôre taking edge or defensive line. Honestly as simple as that. *Especially* with [NAME] as GM
radical would be good. Poverty has to be erased before society is allowed to maximize individual wealth as it is doing now.
But actually, they are all beta

Well good luck and have fun!
They must've been inside a tornado or something, might be what caused the tree to fall behind them.
Is your job my job? Because I don't know what it is about hardware stores that make Ppl stupid but hell are they stupid...
Yup. Lol
That's a great start! Amazing. I congratulate you on your self awareness. Some hugs if you want them
yeah i heard the therm used before but not in the same context as this one.But here it just makes me burst out laughing
Of course man, I really appreciate this. But it's okay, I can just message you through here. It's fine:)
Are u gey
I don‚Äôt like [NAME] As I love the 2nd amendment Can we stop him ?
Looks like some salty Detroit fans downvoting you lol

And unfortunately there's no legal way for us to withhold our tax dollars to demonstrate the effect.
I think this was part of the actual movie, bud.
After five years she realizes that's not for her? No offense but thats a long time to do so.
No. [NAME] is the clear #1. But [NAME] could go first round
Oh, lol, no, I was asserting that you are being racist and have prejudices. That was a funny one, lol.
Never heard of this before, but I think it's awesome. Thanks for sharing! Can I buy this track on Bandcamp?
Then it was effectively them pissing on your territory. Same with the bed. They don‚Äôt get to pass the threshold again!
Seriously. A lot of small businesses especially rely on federal work. I hope this gets solved soon.
This is why I love this subreddit.
Also very funny that communists can still expect it to end up in a different end-game. Well not funny though. :
No I did not. Cool
Trust me, I'd love to have foreskin but there's some sort of weird thing going on here involving circumcision.
Oh. This is so true. I have maybe 2 close friends. Smh
Maybe? Must‚Äôve been one intense game of [NAME]. ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I enjoy vintage cooking porn. A young [NAME] trussing a round roast, for example. 
Sounds like a really bad time. Just wait till you have a nice time and place to trip.

Nah, there's no such message.

New to the area. I would think it's due to the cold. I havent seen my neighborhood this dark.
Would any gathering of the Knights of Ren count? Or would they have to officially organize a thing.
What happened?
Very cute!

This is awesome!
I am legitimately confused as to why don't they do what Warhammer does with its video game licenses.
Thank you so much!
Oh such a embarrassing mistake, or was it?
Well that has cleared up, but the damage is done and there is zero trust now, so it'll never end.
Let it go.
I um like your username
You're welcome. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

I did not know that, and tbf I did completely neglect my MH between 18-23. Too busy with sex, drugs and alcohol.

I was always in awe of just how stunning she was. She doesn't photograph well though, it's a shame. 
And who would you vote for, exactly
>How can I hate [NAME] I like [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]? And [NAME]
You would think so, huh? Not the first dude who has tried to use that rationale. The first one I dated though.
I‚Äôm a left-leaning libertarian, and it annoys me that the left won‚Äôt have an honest conversation on immigration and border security.
I have nothing to say to you.
r/rareinsults also i‚Äôm surprised this guy isn‚Äôt fussing over the ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù instead of ‚Äúits‚Äù
Man, I could go for some veal soon.
Thank you!
I love this. Hopefully it is more successful than [NAME] (RIP).
They lead a bad defense though. And [NAME] isn‚Äôt blameless here, he‚Äôs not good against the run.
This is the truth they don't want us knowing!
I was too busy catching the pokebugs!
Irrational anger especially certain family members

It‚Äôs not outrageous though. Just a 2 night hotel stay alone for 1600 people will be around 200k.
Dear [NAME]. What country is this?
And apparently she was pregnant then anyway, because that‚Äôs when they broke up and she admitted it happened when they were together! 
That was an old-fashioned Good old hockey brawl! What a fight! [NAME] definitely got the best of him though!

Why are you so fucking concerned with what someone else uses to clean their teeth? You sound like a toothpaste troll.
My knees, I had to quit running because they got so bad. Even hiking starts hurting after awhile, especially on long downhills Also glasses and deep voices
Oh it‚Äôs hilarious, but not because of the act, but because of the overreaction of everyone in these threads.

I remember that one! She was so proud of herself for all the organization and I just felt bad for the kids.
Bhahahahahahahahah. Right. Your attitude seems pissy.
Yet we keep supporting this race to the bottom to the worst tolerable option...

Brilliant post!
No you said communism is a more extreme form of socialism.
What a waste of money and time
I used to be subscribed to [NAME] channel. I know we all have troubled pasts, but man...

Yeehaw! It's time for a hoedown!!!!
Oh. My. [NAME]. I can‚Äôt handle this
If the girl is hot I wouldnt mind her texting every second cuz I know shes into me

Thank you so much for this post. You wrote what I always thought and couldn't describe.
Whataburger misses you
Thanks for the responses y'all. I'm going to do the gig anyway and hope that nothing too sinister happens! I'll update if anything interesting happens.
This is why, when I do it, I'm gonna do it as quick and brutally as possible. This is inhumane.

Depends how irrational your spouse is, and that's often compounded when minor children are involved.
Washington had it so easy, until they signed [NAME] that stupid contract ...HAHAHHAHAHAHA

It's cute to hear that teens are still having mall dates--I thought those died out 15 years ago.
It doesn't, it just resets back to 1 *before* adding in your upvote. You're not gaming the system lol
I see you flaired it with help,so what do you need help with
They said [NAME] was the strongest candidate too... look at what happened there...
Yeah I knew that game off the top of my head wasn‚Äôt sure if there was anymore
I think he ([NAME]) was escort. And [NAME] was medium.
Sorry, I misread
WUTS THE ISSUE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON?
Just horrible. Doesnt solve any of his problem and removes his strongest tool.
"This made me laugh until i tried to ""like"" the post. Dammit. I am the old people on the Facebook. Shit."
"I'm 5'6"" and three quarters haha. Have hair though."
That‚Äôs not true. She represents those who voted her into power.
43% on a one bedroom apartment (with a nice large balcony) in Potts Point. Sucks to be single.
Damn. So you went back to an old medication and found it no longer worked for you??? I didn't even know that was possible.
Is it possible you've been banned from them? I dont know how I feel about having the special privilege to view that sub lol.
I laughed so hard at this. ü§£
Oh I'm contributing mate, don't you worry. The sub clown has been made to look like a knob again! Enjoy your Sunday night x
The nfl has been the outcome of ref interpretation and flag throwing for years. Why are we surprised this continues?
My day gets better every time a poser is exposed, so thank you. Think of your own content and people will respect you more.
Baby cake!
Yeah, you‚Äôre a racist, and they were right to ask you to leave. 
only facts mate - so nothing you would be interested in
Thank u! Looking for some new podcasts!
I thought they were talking about the cat.
There are people worse than him out in the world right now. He has praised many of them them on numerous occasions.
Yeah. Online schools, who knows what they're like?
I don‚Äôt understand your question, why are you nervous if you are happy with the arrangement and he seems interested? 
[NAME] this is pretty funny bit of info he just revealed I guess he showed up and they were like yeah u got final say deal with it
ASK HER OUT FOR COFFEE OR SOMETHING ALREADY! And while i wish things go well for you with her, next time dont wait for so many signals.
Thats not mold
My faith in humanity is restored. Your good deed has been noted on the Big Board of Doing Nice Things.
oh, he was in the bathroom, they forgot to count him
I'm sorry but data and facts are more important than the emotional experience of having lived through something.
Do you have the link to her GoFundMe?
That opening is quite terrible tbh
The questions are normal enough, but all at once and leading with them is a little weird.
Any league that creates a system that makes a kicker more valuable than WR/RB/QB is a league I don‚Äôt want to play in.
Can you go see her in person?
I found all mutual nut destruction games to be ridiculous and I never played them. My friends all loved them though.
"Just hold on a second...Curley: ""Oh, ok, no problem"""
So you made this purposely to get post karma...
Fear - that's it. You need to work on identifying and overcoming your fears.
Sorry pal, it‚Äôs actually one of my least favorites :/
I love the [NAME] conspiracy and this is a good addition! Thanks for sharing.
Same. OP go hug your mom and tell her she matters to you and your brother. Support and love would be your best bet.
[NAME] was pretty dumb in s7
Guess we gotta wash our clothes with some good ol Vancomycin
Yeah that doesn't sound fun at all. I may just stick to the burbs.... Thanks for the reply.
I love it when cats go all airplane ears
It's cute that she thinks [NAME] thinks of her as a friend
C'mon [NAME]! If you get this done quickly, the sooner [NAME] can begin.
Well, if you are gonna put it that way, I guess I don‚Äôt have much of a choice.
Girl we been knew she's been telling us another album is on it's way since thank you, next
Oh, I know. I just don‚Äôt think that will go over so well. Lol

That's not a denial ü§î
Fucking [NAME] with lazy passes all night long
Your mindset is the right mindset, sadly, it's easier said than done.
BOUNDARIES. have some boundaries. say no. don't go. this is frustrating to read, honestly. don't do things that you hate doing.
podcasts also can help a lot to distract yourself (ÔΩ•œâ<)‚òÜ
">I keep wondering when I'll ""slow down"". Hopefully never? Knowledge is worth pursuing for its own sake. Never stop being curious. "
The [NAME] directed Swiss Army Man. Check out their music video for Turn Down for What. It‚Äôs lovely.
Ah, maybe the YouTube sound or phone sound. I don't know if it can tell when I turn off my desktop speakers
No one is stopping you. I will laugh at you, but go ahead.

If everyone else can figure this out, then I don't see why it's so implausible for the US.
he didn't even invent it. some random youtube video from 2010 was where it originated from.
Yep. Seriously painful to read
That's really interesting! I've seen that happen before too

What the hell
Wow. In real time we have it in action. You lack any degree of self awareness.
spark up bro. Welcome.
Inspiring music that makes you proud.
I‚Äôm battling depression and anxiety and having a healthy diet and loosing weight has helped me
This comment doesn't make sense. I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
It's actually remarkable how universally disliked [NAME] is as a commentator in the community but he still commentates at practically every big melee tournament
okay thanks!
Can confirm, I am restaurant
Well. Good... they should know they've pissed me off
But I do I still love him and he still loves me but he says im too immature
You came to the wrong neighborhood bud lololol.
[NAME] didn't remember lol I'm dying
Yeah. Whose fault is that... maybe the terroristic Gazan government stealing all their money. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a safe bet.
Let‚Äôs not get creative again
If you weren't connected at the head you'd be okay, until the other head started to decompose. You'd probably die of septic shock 
There's a lot big talk here that will look kinda dumb if we're third/fourth midseason. I hope we aren't being clowned halfway through the season...
They‚Äôre not just cute like everybody supposes
salarians don't have marriage, that's probably on account of their short lifespans. 
There is nothing left about r/Canada my man.

I once went alert on N1 and killed 3 people.. 2 maf and a doc. Doc got resurrected later thankfully
Tbh as a [NAME] this sort of news make me happy.
I just went through and read every single one. This is amazing
Yes, exactly. Fix a date and if he still procrastinates ditch him. Or remain his penpal for the rest of your life.
aw, thanks! I appreciate that! 
I‚Äôm sure you could find some unsatisfied women looking for a hook up.
I agree with you! Just wishful thinking from me I guess aha!
Will you ask her to pray to her god and ask him to stop giving kids cancer!
Those are still huge numbers for a guy that can‚Äôt even take a free throw without double clutching his shot.
Yes that is so true why didn‚Äôt I think of that
I just unassigned and left

To my knowledge, Blizzard doesn't have problem with ppl having more than one account. 
Lol your adorable, thanks for the humor

Gotta hurry up before the chicken gets there first.
If the kid knew what she had on her mind, he's been corrupted way too young..
[NAME] MAY be a slightly better hitter, but he can't field for crap. And the other two can't hold a candle to [NAME]
!remindme 1 day
no not really i knew he was joking i was just clarifying what the bloke said
The article mentions that the apps are only for Chinese customers. Is that not the case?
I like to be scared actually!
And now Horse Armour is totally normal. In fact, Horse Armour is now extremely reasonably priced DLC, relatively speaking.
We have a realistic chance of winning this.
[NAME] is a grown man who is attracted to actual children [NAME] is attracted to someone her age [NAME] = [NAME]?????
I did those things in real life and I've never had a single nightmare. Face your fears.

Interesting, I‚Äôll have to try it someday 
[NAME] FINALLY fournier, [NAME]
You hit the nail on the head, my friend.
motivation. Hope this helps you
Why in the world did you marry her? She's ragging on your own sister???
I don‚Äôt want everybody to live the same way as me, I just wanted to express the stupidity of it.
lmao i just laughed so hard at this, screw yates
Weird flex, but ok
You need to be on time regardless. You should have your own transportation to work. Im this was covered during your interview.
He will be perfectly fine besides being very nauseous and probably throwing up.
Uh, you can‚Äôt see the grille?
Caution: [NAME]
Here, you are among friends. I wish we all could meet you in real life and surround you with smiles and hugs. Are you in Utah? 
Happy Cakeday! I met my partner of 6 years at a London [NAME] meet-up ü§©
[NAME] aside, humans arent on the menu, no matter how retarded they may be, no matter if they're sleeping/unconscious.
This isn't even his highlight of his week. It's the highlight of the last few decades. Damn onions.
Maybe one day you'll open yours and realise feminism helps everyone
I agree with [NAME].
Since the ref the Beeb has been worthless.

What a great word
What a trainwreck
They barely even back pedalled.
I guess I dont see a difference between harassing someone and pretending to harass by actually harassing them. Their motivation or pre planning doesnt really change anything right?
Gonna hang it in the grow tent for a few days with the lights off.
You can wait ten years to start working on yourself and get what you want or you can do it now.

Just starting watching , what happened ? See we‚Äôre about to be down by 20 
"I would say more people who have no fucking clue what they are talking about. The hilarity of ""he was trying to advance position""."
[NAME], they deserve each other, but I don‚Äôt want this to happen because they would inevitably procreate and make stupid ‚Äúboring‚Äù kids. 
No thats [NAME]....
I hope ish isn‚Äôt like [NAME] and is forever affected by this injury
Of course. Hang in there <3
Serenity now ! Serenity now !
I have been saying this for a long time, he is way overpaid and the forward position is our main weakness since [NAME] left. 
Be sure to do the promo and get your free scope mount and magazines.
Nope nope nope
Keep your chin high OP. Life ain‚Äôt always beautiful but it‚Äôs a beautiful ride.
Uber is fun and cheap.
Lore wise, this makes sense and I hate/love it with the same energy 
Haha, my family is exactly the same. We must have the horrible eyesight gene I guess.
Oooh. Look! Big man over here!
This same problem exists in playground as well.
Is that the cobbler in the background of the family portrait? This is great.
I take it you haven't checked your balances lately...
because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
My fav time to walk around the city. Everything looks nicer to me.
2010. [NAME] being all desperate, [NAME] return. Shit was gold
I fell asleep with the feeds on last night and woke up pretty frightened at the noises coming from my computer. Thank you for casting Tom BB hahahaha
[NAME] didn‚Äôt actively take any guns or accessories from me. [NAME] is... stop repeating circa 2012 Fox News propaganda to protect an active traitor.
What's ridiculous is this stupid post and this asinine idea that white people are these constant victims
Bro this is awesome
[NAME] still got a little pop tho for calling for the match. Makes me smile that the crowd still loves her.
it doesn't happen all the time
Usually its better just to ignore the dude whos insane, because you don't know if he has a knife or a gun
yeah you got wooshed way too hard
I‚Äôm rather surprised that these books are STILL being made. Like I thought they died off around 2014.
Yes, that is correct. I knew what you meant though:)
Ok. But you claimed it was NEM and now you think it's neither after being fact checked.
Oh nice, gonna add that to the list. Thanks!
As a pioneer of the 4 corners I vote you leave this question to someone else and just keep your head down
Oh but they will be sweet photos to look at in the future.
The second overall pick is pretty embarrassing
The second half of the game was a big disappointment for me. I really wish they kept the family around for much longer.
Ugh [NAME]. She reps a lot of people from the Bachelor
Update: I'm braving out because I need food and drink and a shower but I also may freak out panicking.
And in some aren't permitted outside the home without a lawful, legitimate purpose.
Here, kiddo. Happy cake day. You need it more than I do.
Wow, kinda lame that if this true, most of us probably don't know about it.
Whatever you do, don't give your virginity to anyone. You will regret it if you give it up cheaply. 
I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Cheers for the info!
thanks. I really hope it does get better
You are goddam funny sir
just say whore.
Goodbye [NAME]
>How do you know I didn't Because you posted this dumbass post. And only someone who didn't would say that
Well Played
But, oh boy, they can try.
Additionally, over the years I developed ED and PE... and it sucks. Just thought I would put that out there.
Well, supposedly [NAME] wrote TPM in only a couple days, and people hated it.
makes no sense, troll harder
Yeah almost as unfunny as your mom ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I love this idea
I mean it‚Äôs definitely rushed but your clock is ticking and could be possibly on the verge of running out. I say go for it.
I love how he bends down with his head in the 'loaded' guillotine to screw off the end cap.
Paws come flying out from the dark
Wow this is pretty interesting. We should have a thread about what's it like to grow up in a polygamous household
That guy probably makes minimum wage doing delivery. And you just not only stole the pizza he delivered but his bike too. Belongs in r/imatotalpieceofshit
Not in this sub. Take your edge elsewhere.
Its deathprofessor lol. That's her Twitter account.
We all know that everyone was doing the Kiki do you love me ironically so that if people do it unironically then we can make fun of them.
I want to thank you for seriously entertaining me today. Best clip ever.
Crisis centers are not only for battered women they are for abused women as well. From the looks of it, they are all abusing you. 
Yes, its from the song Ultimate by [NAME] (kinda of a hype/rap song)
Hot damn.
I fucking love this GIF so much.
Who knew Mother's Day had move to Jan 25th????
You absolutely should not tell her.
You sound like my gf. I'm so lucky to have her in my life.
That is not accurate based on the conversation i had with Mr. [NAME] today.
Extremely relatable.
The entire generations thing needs to die. What are they useful for? Feeding the ego of some dumbass on the internet?
Be careful of ticks tho
Yes in the right places as do bites, again they have to be in the right places.
Nah, just gotta aim better.
[NAME] good one i like that
Someone has sex with that.
The alternative to [NAME] didn't inspire any passion in anyone, and greed, illiberalism and self-centeredness isn't confined to any ethnic group.
To be fair, [NAME] broke his heart first
That's not even the sub I put. Bad bot.
That sounds really agonising, to ask for help and have no one hear you. What's going on for you right now?
And still so few go to college): Such a broken system.
If we leave the turtle alone with too many barnacles it can suffocate and die.
Thanks for the love bro
That looks like some pretty intense ‚Äúhomework‚Äù
If you're not helpless so be super easy to fix.
I would try rubbing alcohol, high percentage. Looks greasy to me.
What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it.

No foreplay, no connection, if he doesn't know what he's doing. If he asks for a blow job and then refuses to reciprocate. 
[NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.
Ive initiated with men I dont have ahigh attraction to. I have a high libido. Your post seems overly simplistic of gender.
"Lol what a terrific audience. Maybe rich people saying ""come beg"" is kinda like wtf bro."
That happens to me even when I‚Äôm not stoned‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Id be glad, I used to take those off when I was a kid. I dont want brightly colored rocks in my brownie

I'm sorry you poop your pants every time someone mixes those words up.
You've violated rules 4 and 5. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.
It‚Äôs a great site showing the growth and development of a re-bourgeoning city.
literally exactly my thoughts on this!!! also happy cake day!!
* [NAME]: 17 million * [NAME]: 90 billion * [NAME]: 4 trillion I think that one question sums up the DLB Show perfectly.
I am not saying that I think many of the latest disputes my husband and i have had ours for a little while longer.
"I said ""try."" Red wine is a thing for a reason"
Bide your time, keep your eyes open, and build the reputation and relationship needed. The opportunity will come.
The most sense the internet has produced in a long time. [NAME] bless this dude.
Okay... am I the only one curious how in the hell a fourth grader managed to get expelled?
Desperation is unattractive, stop being so desperate. Love yourself before you can love someone else.
My point is that [NAME] is a giant hypocrite for claiming he wants to respect party democracy while ignoring members.
Thanks yeah that sounds good
Well, that's only if you assume that something being impossible is the opposite of something being possible.
You're disgusting
That arena announcer is irritating.
That would be terrible. I liked the way private Practice ended (more or less) so hopefully [NAME] doesn‚Äôt go for something cliche.
I read it on NRK as well. Brought tears to my eyes.
Just piss off
Maybe this isn‚Äôt too bad after all
No. Can‚Äôt get off to my own sex.
I haven't seen a single [NAME] article. But there have been a few [NAME] articles around recently.
Enthusiasm is not helpful, got it. Edit: lol what a bunch of snowflakes.
I'm sorry Mom, your child has autism, or this is a lie.
"Fair enough. I typically focus more on the lower bound because I hate when people use ""millennials"" as a synonym for ""youths."" "
That‚Äôs an interesting point, thank you.
For sure larrisa so I can try and bang her
I just use a very generic ‚Äúthis card wont seem to process for some reason, do you have another form of payment you could try?‚Äù
At least he is getting paid assuming that is a non us airport
Thank you for subscribing to Bull Facts ^^TM !
Great show - up until the last half of the final episode. It was such a lackluster, disappointing ending for what was a great series.
I know! If it's going to be that cold I want snow. I think there's a chance next weekend
"How about ""Your rich, you should use some of your wealth to seek professional help. I wish you the best of luck."""
Nothing like a little bit of whataboutism. We can think they're *both* idiots.

thanks man.
This made me soooo uncomfortable yikes
The comments on this thread are what I expected and that makes me sad.
Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is.
I believe that's the first game winner at the buzzer at home in Raptors history
Needles = government/big pharma who are only out to get you
Not to nitpick, but wasn't [NAME] (I assume that's what they mean by [NAME], but people are weird) [RELIGION]?
No, it's still up. It was in the comments, though, not the text itself.
Or finishing in 91 minutes and sitting there for another half hour, bursting for a piss
Have to love Billy's commitment. Absolutely hilarious.
True but I think we should be able to strike a deal for less than 50-60m which is worth it in today's market imo
I believe it
If you are following the schedule, your kid got up to 6 in one visit...at 2 months.
Pray. I remember that happening a couple weeks ago when the whole system went down internationally. Maybe check your connection and refresh, all that jazz.
I‚Äôm sure losing obj will help [NAME] get out of his slump, or help develop whichever rookie qb they bring in. 
Comments like this needs a Not Safe For Coffee tag.
I think we should, he is one of the best centers in the game 
it sounds like a huge pain in the ass to use compared to current systems in place though.
I was going to ask the same thing! There are dozens of us!
Marginal propensity to consume is what I have heard. Any consumption tax is going to hurt poor more than rich, it is basic economic 101.
Okay, thanks for the clarification!
[NAME]. I love that this is the top comment.
I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
That's a very long winded way to say 'i disagree'
Can he fire himself?
So if it was a 14yo girl and she wanted it it‚Äôs ok?
I clicked tive times on the Facebook like Button
Treat yo self!
Going by it's [NAME] rating though, the district should be leaning blue. 
Because unlike [NAME] this guy hasn‚Äôt done anything controversial
"Update: All is well with the old man. Thanks for letting me vent in a ""creative way."""
When was this? Is it in opposition to the coup?
Omg, this is hilarious 
Putting your finger and a loose cloth inside the 3 jaw chuck to polish the inside is insanely dangerous
They're playing on their phone and smoking in the toilet too. That's how they take a break. I'd rather take a walk outside personally
It's pretty much a new format now, it must have been TF2 centred. 
I wish the 'opt out of redesign' button actually worked :(
Okay, thank you!
Sure. Minus the ones that decided to wear MAGA hats and harass the indigenous people‚Äôs march.
[NAME] is an unrestricted free agent as well
Nope. A mamzer is someone who was born from an adulterous affair between two [NAME]. You're 100% [NAME] though!
You're an awful human being.
You're really on a shit-posting streak lately. Something happen in your life that you need to talk about, bud?
Yes [NAME] are authoritarian. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre always the ones advocating for bigger government and more government control over everything.
This is my favourite movie. Not enough can be said for [NAME] acting. One of the best things about it.
I did twist my ankle trying to play that on DDR.
I liked the magic but it's really superfluous. Dr [NAME] is literally just ironman with a bad accent, like why does this exist
So you reject your ideology's premise that you can just protect yourself.
Friendly fire dude, I wanted the other criminal 
Hamada‚Äôs my favourite
I would love to jam with you guys but I would need to buy an instrument here :(
The titles of her posts are somewhat dramatic and I have avoided her because of that
I totally agree and I think this was suggested before as well
Hey I said that to my grammar once
Wow, not exactly a complimentary typo. 
Is there a legendary dark star skin? Does the kayn one count?
I was jumping the same gun but decided to do some googling just in case. Glad I did :)
Vegans are [NAME] because the [NAME] were all about showing empathy to others that were different from themselves, the central tenant of veganism.
And her face too colt bites his finger nails it says
Last time, on Arrested Development...
I heard her affair wrecked his marriage. His wife saying anything about that would wreck [NAME].
Do you happen to know which movie/book he is talking about? Would love an interview link if you have it!
Who cares honestly.
Not shocked by the subs [NAME] is active in...
Hey. Maybe talking can help you last till then. What's bothering you?
Well that was disheartening.
I love the comradely for finding the source
This sounds interesting
somebody's sad lol lol
It was a screech of delight. I like this hire. Would let to get a good OC now.
Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer
Why would a poll showing a negative favorability rating go to her head? If anything, people should be worried this will cause her to change her approach.
TSA agents are like tow truck drivers. Everyone hates them.
People need to relax. [NAME] as the 5th starter is fine. Look at his road splits. Limit his starts at home.
No shit. Stupidest idea having a safe place for junkies to get fucked up.
Ah didn‚Äôt know what that term meant. Got bored with all the party terminology. But yes, I guess I am. 
One dumbass who hasn‚Äôt watched Hereditary complaining about meaningless awards on the Internet means... eh. I lost my point. Go watch Hereditary
Wow, I had a cousin named [NAME] who ordered corn. Very nice lady, she died 2 years ago. Miss her xoxo
In collage. Now tell me that ain't insecurrr...
Actually, if anything, my dad always comments about how honest and straight forward my generation is compared to his generation.
It isn't a bad thing if the population in question is low IQ.

I love being a mom. My little is almost 4 weeks old and I feel like I was made for this.
It is. Something I've wondered about many times
whats it like being this stupid?
Guess we know where they got the rivet for the fire pit now.
Well, he was until season 3, which was ironically when [NAME] made them take that test.
These are good ideas, thank you so much.
Yeah I had android and was having difficulties but I was able to get it easily when using my gf's mac. Thanks!
I FUCKING WIN
Yeah mate, was just being sarcastic. [NAME] after January is something else. But still, I'm happy for [NAME].
This is why [NAME] did what he did
Making you sign a refusal of service waiver is scared of liability. Charging you for it is shady.
"Wish we hadn't already played them twice so we could hop in on this with something like ""Stanley Cup Parade Planners are here to battle"""
Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.
missed a good chance to copy the one the UNC football player wrote a few years ago for an A-
The similarity to cigarette companies is eerie.
Being a nice, interesting person has helped me get a lot of friends but hasn't really gotten me anywhere with regards to women. 
The men who didn't get other matches were being hypergamous in matching with a [NAME].
And I can't call the capitol switchboard to express my concern about this because the government is shut down. Awesome.

Sometimes though, the developer's vision is close to perfect, something that other games don't offer. 
Seeing the Reverend talk to his son like that always made me feel uncomfortable but also mad.
Yknow that is one of the main reasons farmers have a lot of kids right? Cheap labor.

"Just the fact that people constantly use words like ""incel"" to demean people proves that society is getting worse than it already is."

Thank you. We‚Äôre seven months into reconciliation. We definitely had HB for the first couple weeks as well.

I think peach is hotter but not her attitude ha

[NAME] is back. So erect.
welcome to a whole new world, my friend 
No mate. Don't keep in touch with any of them anymore.

Likewise, Reddit has just gotten strange recently, sorry for misinterpreting.
Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
They did and he is going to be extremely difficult to feel much empathy for him.
Woord stay safe and have fun my friend. That‚Äôs a good find haha

He is good! Funny thing is, a lot of the religious dogmatics in his videos remind me of certain IT posters.
And she will try so be careful op
I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
You shouldn't force someone to come out you know. Now look at what you did! You killed [NAME]! You bastard!
Of course you can. Wear a racist T-shirt for a day and see what happens.

This is funny but is it a meme or just a dude‚Äôs cool selfie ?
Thank you for your concern, fellow conservative
If this is true, then we should be having kids out the ass
The Watchmen just moved from Amazon to Netflix. Every time I watch that movie I like it way more. Hope I contributed here.
Yes. Especially if you didn't succeed in putting the fire out.
Saving this. Happy 2019 to ya!
> [NAME] X-Wing in TLJ appears to be a newer model, T-70, like [NAME]. that make it even more stupid....
I wish I could be half as cool as that guy
Because feminists have equal rights already. Feminism only still exists because some women figured out that they could use to further their privilege.
it‚Äòs literally a fanmade album tbh
:o I have one too! I didn't get anything but bullied at school, though.
that is one very expensive mistake
You need a hug buddy?
And judging from *this* comment, I think you should know you sound like a troll.
Do you remember if [NAME] was carrying a white piece of paper? Oh yeah...you don't forget a thing like that...
I'm glad we agree.
I'd say it's pretty uncommon now.
It will be too late by then.
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors.

That's without the Observant feat as well which knocks an extra 5 on it
That‚Äôs because this is clearly an advertisement and not something that would actually be served to someone
Love ignores poverty
Lol, I‚Äôm so sorry for u. Do u go down on her a lot? If so she need to give something too...
I just hope a GM believes in [NAME] as much as this Raptors fan. Maybe [NAME] could give us something valuable to get this future MVP back.
I need a woman like this in my life
Nah, according to OPs limited post history, he's a pedophile. 
The characters and story are really enjoyable. The dungeons are awesome. Generally decent sidequests. Fun items. Cool art style and character designs
The card game in Episode 2 is probably the happiest [NAME] has been in a while.
lol @ the dude lying down in the hut at 2:12
I missed this. Wow that is a travesty
And they won‚Äòt until it hits them - or not even then, somehow blaming it on others too.
Wow! I've never heard of a celebrity doing something so nice
Ah haven't heard of them before. [NAME] is from Fourig which is right outside Dayton. Congrats on your new addition! <3
[NAME] should give him a little tough love
Looks like a plate to me. A stupid plate. But a plate nonetheless.
Read. Smoke weed. Video games. Smoke weed and CLEAN ALL THE THINGS!
For games starting at 7, the bus was leaving the hotel around 4:30, I think.
Don't think so. Pretty sure i tried it on the MOG 12
My mistake lol
Except he does literally every game, but not everyone can watch them. 
This is reminiscent of when we thought we were lucky that we got [NAME] AND [NAME] on our staff.
[NAME] is poor now so it's open season
I need to know the backstory on this!
Holy shit! Did not see that coming! Gonna miss you [NAME] :(
at some point you just have to make some shots -[NAME]
so by that logic the right lost its mind about a year ago
Oh wow. You really know your stuff. Luckily I don't have diabetes yet so that's something
Cool, but what's your point? You gave some context without really saying what you think.
No income = no pension payments required. Health care, I think is mandatory, but I don‚Äôt know the enforcement scheme.
It'll be difficult to do but leave him and take the kids with you
Isn‚Äôt this from the trade deadline last year. Shouldn‚Äôt have any bearing on contract offers this year
I have silvered it as it was what I was thinking and they beat me to it hahaha
I prefer having the TV in the background more than music. Music is something I enjoy in the car or walking in the city.
Well now I have [NAME] in my head for the morning! Love a bit of Northern soul.
Oh yeah yeah
Aquaria just lost her shit when the Cup Toss challenge went awry
[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too
Thank [NAME], good luck and hope you find the happiness you seek
If I haven‚Äôt told you lately...I love you and you are my hero. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm surprised they find toothpaste still
Lol. Thanks for the advice friend
That might be [NAME] excuse to eliminate her. In a very [NAME] way
That was probably the most balanced doco I've seen on NK so far. Still think [NAME] went in without a completely open mind.
"I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."
This exchange made my day. From a female doc, thanks for getting it. 
Get a line haul local job. I work 9 hours a day.
Wow. My first comment here (I think) is met with hate! Ouch!
Oh, [NAME]... [INSERT SITCOM LAUGH TRACK HERE]
.. for now
I would love to watch you become jaded by [NAME].
I agree with everything. Yet, society and its stupid outdated, conservative norms see it otherwise.
ü§£ wow... I read it all in a serious tone until the end! ü§£
Doctor: ‚ÄúI have good news and bad news‚Äù Patient: ‚Äúgood news first‚Äù Doctor: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre naming a disease after you‚Äù
Okay then. It sounds like you have it all figured out. Good luck.
I wish I could forget
It's a great museum. Very graphic. Very moving. Very emotional. You might need a couple hours and some drinks to mentally realign yourself.
What was that?!
Ya so in a sense, you're just feeding strangers for a few days. Kind of charitable in a way
FBI OPEN UP!!!!
I stopped reading in the first paragraph where they try to make Vanderpump Rules and Desperate Housewives legit shows.
Ok, I will take this with a pinch of salt, but take it into consideration nonetheless. Thanks.
You too! Yay to a family of choice!
Sweet thanks for the update. I hope the kitty finds a good home
Whichever was toxic first, easy. This is why we ONLY camp when one of them is toxic first.
People in distressed states, get very disturbed by loud bangs, it really hard to keep them calm, it has a knock on effect for days. 
I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
"I mean, one has to do the research. Buying a lemon doesn't mean that having a car is ""worthless""."
More like 11 feet up, but still painful. 
It honestly sounds like he has some type of addiction to games. Reminds me a lot of my ex.
Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you. 
That‚Äôs the most intelligent question I‚Äôve ever been asked. I *could* answer it...
Uh no. He hates [NAME]. Not in A kayfabe way. He doesn't like [NAME] at all.
Thank you! I do so love making people laugh, and when they let me know I did good.
It seems like good advice.
> Woo that sadness out Welp, never gonna be able to have a night out on the town again without this coming up
Growth cannot persist forever in a finite system.
I actually day trade blue chip stocks whenever I get the chance.
Kinda like a thing that comes out of the ground and it smells nice, I think. Cannot confirm
Gotta wonder how a fake BC could possibly result from a 'mixup'.
I like Celtic fans more than Buck fans
10/10 reading. I don't care if it happened this way or not. I was sufficiently entertained!
There‚Äôs no reason to scare a parent into vaccinating their child with all this crazy talk of measles and polio. Everyone‚Äôs right!
That's a stock photo, bud.
I don't wanna be controversial, but the streak might end...
They always message looking repeat business. Women don't use cam models.
That's what I ended up actually doing.
leg-lock speaks to me in the most animalistic level
Shame ,your quite cute 
This made me lol, I don't want to sound racist but.... *goes completely ham with the racism*
BULGARIA!!!
You and everybody else is free to contribute though. Unlike r/bitcoin where all of us once came from.
Nah they'll make their own post that's really passive aggressive about SOME people not understanding [insert fatlogic excuse here]
On [NAME], the allegations and the final result were very different. If I recall most of the complaints substance was rejected or disproven.
This is probabaly going to be an unpopular opinion but I definitely think all police cars should be clearly marked, unless they're part of an undercover operation.
It will only get worse over time. Do what I didn‚Äôt. Run.
I‚Äôd be very concerned if the posts on this sub were coming from 7 year olds.
Sorry, my phrasing was terrible. Not across the board, but eggs are definitely an example where OP was right.
Feel free to tell me. I‚Äôll get to it eventually
Is [NAME] okay?
Clapping ~~for~~ at me. FTFY
Yeah, fat does that.
Nice! You and her would get along i bet. She loves her crafty machines and creative people. üòá
Sure you are, comrade. You've met your quota of replies now, yes?
lol not wearing any clothes in the pic
Dude nsfw this damn
After they put the bullet in it I wouldn't be surprised if it got scaled back even further, considering just how much of the community up and bailed
Welcome to Reddit!
I'm climbing the walls right now. Just let me out of the house.
They played a lot worse on Saturday. Saturday was really, really bad for me.
That was my favorite PS1 game.
"""Fake neeeeeews !"""
Using Vtrigger and Vskill buttons!? Oh My.
Despite the certainty of some, we do not know. But we do know [NAME] is loving and merciful, and we hope for the salvation of all.
Thank you [NAME]!
This is going to be the last episode with my Latina goddess [NAME] üåπüò≠
Happy cake day! It'll be tough, but stick to it and you will come out the other side better for it.
Man this sub has become so elitist and snooty.
I've got no place else to go...
People are very complicated.
Yet... here you are, a nodoby whining about others accomplishments on the internet. 13 year old you was probably smarter than you are now.
Wonder if some of the ‚Äòcuse guys we got because nobody was available anymore will be cycled out
Iirc congressional opposition was the main obstacle for closing gitmo. I could be misremembering but that's what I remember
Apart from the attempted basketball pass he's been great
Worst father ever award?
Yeah. All they have to do is ask for absolution, which means [NAME] can live a life of sin and repent and go to their heaven.
Imagine ur mom doing that I‚Äôm crying
This was such a genius character. Even reading quotes makes me breakout laughing, every time
They always blab about IQ and other garbage but they have the intelligence of a bag of hammers.
not to distract from the refs but i mean we have a deep bench and pull our starters early
Nursing school is wrong on that. Still, sickle cell is really, legitimately painful. Give the Dilaudid.
I love Wood Witch, still saving to buy that.
Essence is amazing!
Take the compliment you good egg x
Oh man, I remember loving that movie. Been a while ssince I've seen it but I remember being pretty enthralled.
Loook all around youuuu. All throughout Nature is evidence of a creator and his love ‚ù§Ô∏èfor us
Still haven't heard a good reason why the delay isn't shorter
Thats my GOAT
Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
You can't simply shut a baby up, lol
I don't understand the infatuation with modern ones. Everything made before the Murci√©lago is where it's at.
Of course there are a lot of people who think feminism and diversity are bad.
He told you to handle it, you did. If he doesn't like it, he should've taken care of it.
Yas! Mom was done talking, wasn't she.
I like to imagine that this is england in its entirety
The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
True. But that is one out of many.
So sorry you are hurting.
Not to mention that the full video is part of the kids PR campaign according to [NAME] idiot
Stay away from the sub till then ahaha
Hopefully they realize that anti-discrimination law is immoral and unconstitutional.
Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer u/justforyouthlogic
I love the claps after he fell ü§£
You‚Äôre in Iceland, a particularly craggy rock would be pretty interesting to you. 
Don't give away my zip code! Craft beer and fabuloso be dammed!!
lol. good one dude. you really showed me. great argument. really showing off your intellectual prowess. keep up the good work!
I know but for that one moment he was more than that guy who snuck in [NAME] room at night and wore his helmet
What the fuckkkkk burn itt
It doesn't matter if they are crazy stacked. We definently shouldnt be last in the league.
Well, that was dumb.
Because all those delusional people be doing the same shit in their real life.
This was posted, word for word, on r/CrazyIdeas not too long ago. It's a joke
This primary doesn‚Äôt deserve this nice birthday.
Most GH now is fake. The real stuff is exorbitantly expensive.
"Lol I always go with public speaking (""but I'm trying to be better at it!!""). "
What? Even his follow up comment was related to dog hair.
that makes it a really bad stand if you're a hero, though, since jojo villains get a +90 modifier to dog-killing
Good lord, the whole him and [NAME] being twins thing got so stuck in my head this season that I thought this was about [NAME].
A few years ago a lot of shows tried to do a ‚Äúsecond screen experience‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt work and died a quiet death.
A volley into a header. Just wow. The skills.
Sorry about that. I hope the fix is more appropriate. Thank you!
That was never going to happen.
My fianc√© had it custom made as an early Valentine‚Äôs Day gift!
‚Äúwe love [NAME]!‚Äù
I Will as soon as I get out of The mental hospital lol thank you for recommending it. I love [NAME]
It's nothing on you. I just hate the idea from a justice standpoint. I strive for fairness as much as I'm able.
Probably when they fired their cartoonist a few months ago for having the wrong opinions.
We smart apes
I did this v recently and now my legs are covered in ingrown hairs >.<
That‚Äôs a shame. What‚Äôs worse, evangelicalism or Scientology? Tough call
[NAME] didn't do all that much with [NAME] and [NAME] and a much better supporting cast either.
> broaden your vocabulary I'll try my best. Thank you for this
I'm so glad [NAME] finally got her visa, she's going to do awesome living in the USA!!!!
Just buy a load of old iPhone back covers in China.
Awesome! I look forward to updating.
I love it, I understand they can't just get rid of [NAME] for her, but I would be so angry watching [NAME] boss her around.
So, they want a more profitable split? Surprised they wouldn't go for the Discord store then. Didn't it offer even better a split?
Thanks! That was an interesting read. Seems there really is a city where they built more homes than there were people to live there!
See the other one has advertising that hides the fucking stupid [NAME] that's the difference!
I don't know dude, but I'm just saying that it's not weird at all that people are super doubtful whenever posts like this crop up. 
I mean I guess your prostate is healthy right?
Cute but I dont like where this is going
Nice language üëè
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
Lmao I have like 12 days played cop farming who even does that anymore oh my [NAME] you‚Äôre pathetic for even bringing up ages
Please. I can‚Äôt even with these comments.
[NAME] sounds happy to be back! So glad we have the full crew today!!
Oh boy, leprosy!
I think you responded to the wrong comment.
What are you referencing?
I mean there's some truth in so far as the criticism should be first and foremost directed towards the parents, with [NAME] in a close second.
To me it looks like they were driving with both feet, as the brakes were on while they were accelerating... Something I will never understand.
"Meanwhile, I was literally saying to myself ""*I like rusty spoons*"" earlier this morning RIGHT BEFORE logging onto Reddit. Kinda strange"
LOOKKIT THIS PHOTERGRAPH
Aww that was endearing [NAME].
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you are 11 or 12 years old.‚Äù Lol what?
yeah same issue with hockey short of places like [NAME]. 82 game schedule.
It's a great article. She nailed it.
the farm is where polly ran off to in season one while she had her babies!
I feel like [NAME] isn't a legend.
It was actually pretty great, definitely going to return next week! :)
It must be really sad and lonely under your bridge troll.
Yo your eyes are glued wide open like aderal and you move your head all the way back you are done
3h late comment. have fun at school !
Also what a waste of resources. Teach them something actually real and useful, not made up nonsense.
Or you have msdn
> Religion Lol the cowardice that you won't say '[RELIGION]'.
So brave!
That‚Äôs just fucked lol talk about cheap.
just go google search, but some r real some r unreal lol
"OMG its youuuuuuu u/Sippinthatminttea. I remember you üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ ""interesting creature"" üòã üòÇ "
Who ever said [NAME] was the true pope.
Where‚Äôs your shop my dude? I‚Äôm in Sydney I‚Äôll come visit for a haircut
They don‚Äôt want to fight, they want to dress up and play in the woods every month 
It would work just fine. I wear medium shirts and a small or medium jersey fits me great.
One of my favorite episodes.
Goodness, don't say that. But then, if that half is the one that survives I don't want to
Best comment ever
Maybe, idk though. I dont think thats enough to nail him. We need more.
Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less. 
This hit me with de good ol memories
Do people really have that big of a problem with border security? Lol fuckin children
This made me gag lol
But they're this close to breaking new evidence of Russian interference!
Can you share a link to video?
Reminds me of that chick and the lizard, [NAME], and 7-11 tried to get the store number lol
This is the bus station way outside the city center and nowhere near the sea Edit: Unfortunately Turkey does lack aesthetic appeal outside Istanbul tourist areas
>I get that.. You don't
Might is generous lol. He totally killed that guy.
But it's still raping infantry. The case rounds OHK infantry up close. It's just horrendously weak against planes now...
So you agree.
You‚Äôre not going to convince anyone else either if you refuse to back up any of your claims.
[NAME]? He doesn't steal it, and he acts like shep in me2. But yeah, the picture looks like [NAME], more than a femshep. 
That just shows how similar people can be in this kind of situation, demanding, rude, and can sometimes damage stuff without care
Yeah...it's difficult to have sympathy for someone like yourself
Well, [NAME] definitely a better actor but [NAME] seems like a better match for [NAME]
He‚Äôa establishment trash. I despise [NAME].
XD lol yes. Ragnarok
Nah dude, cats care about you more than anything, they just don't like to show it because they're tsundere
What is love
Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times.
Even [NAME] had a few missed dunks and airballs. Extremely rare, but they happened. 
I'm betting she's 18 or 19 and freaking out about bills. She'll recognize her error years from now and regret it for a long time.
this is one of those mt lebo residents y'all were railing on the other day
Omg congratz for you guys!!!!! That is amazing news :) good luck with twins.
How hard is it to kill 9 year olds!? One of my favorite movies.
(I tried to answer this in my below comment but I also just wanted to say I really love your username)
Says millennials are afraid of hard work, dismisses the hard work required to get a fit body.
Thank you for this. It sums up exactly what I wish I could send to all my TBM family
We gotta throw the whole world away
Meh, the liga that we all knew and loved went away when [NAME] fled to Italy
I like to think that the next update will add zeros effects towards the tac mask challenge. Speed things up real quick.
I wish I loved anything the way [NAME] loves playing hockey
Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME]
You just blew my mind. Why haven't I thought of that before. You think someone would have explored that far east.
I concur:
Rule 3 removed.
Why would the landlord pay it if electric isnt included. Sorry to OP, need to cut the heat down
Just do the steps and stop complaining.
That‚Äôs a wonderful meaningless word salad
Damn, I fell for the myth. Thanks for pointing it out.
Awesome! I'm really excited. Are you there too?
Carmichael is near the bottom? Find that hard to believe. [NAME] just under McDaniels? Words cannot accurately describe how inaccurate that is.
I guessed this
It just so happened that PD, sick kids , and family emergencies all happened to overlap between all my coworkers leaving me all alone. 
>I thought we were retiring the older guys. Because the geniuses on reddit said so?
The guy who tells people to shut up
It was the most a receiver ever put on the Legion of Boom Seahawks though, so that's cool.
bingo!!
Look at you, this is excellent. üëèüèª I really love this. 
"Oh my [NAME], is this the new transphobia specific ""Post Hog""? Because it really should be."
Protecting the border is self-defense. It's not really a selfish thing to do.
Lmao is this a bot?
Thanks for the information. What about any programs in the air force.
I was trying to prove the other guys comment
If people don't act the way I want it is because they have bad reasons. Lol
That thang juicy
Ah there it is
Truth is, we don't know. Never tried it really.
I do know not one neighbor looked out to check on us because they told me....
I‚Äôm really excited for this year! Especially the Wu Lin hero , I can‚Äôt wait to wield my double-handed jianüòçüòç
I hear you buddy. I rage so hard my jaws lock
So then what do I do? Should I tell priests? Will they kick me out?
Boy what an accomplishment, so proud!
Japan shouldn't have attacked the USA.
I see it everyday!
She looks like an early game killer.
Shrug, ndp is still going to lose. I don‚Äôt really care how many there are.
I think they should have gone with ‚ÄúBreaking news: even healthcare professional can‚Äôt see the future.‚Äù
This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
He already has 2 fouls
Does not look bad! Thnx!
Some people are just very special lmao
Just file and have her served, she'll get the message. You've tried to talk with her but she's being difficult. 
Was literally just on rags subreddit. Even they knew our first shot would be a goal.
OLD can be a dangerous place. Gotta stay safe somehow!
It‚Äôs the little things!!
Try taking the fillings of your sandwiches to the edges and maybe your kids would stop leaving the edges.
The ending was so badass as a young kid! He wasnt even in his mech!
Ha. It will start calling my neighbors slurs in no time
It shouldn't be, I feel like that's happened to us many times! 
But you do know it, so that's good
I think its safe to assume that we're clearly referring to the article and topic at hand.
I hate people.
Oy vey! Shut it down!
Ok I love [NAME] for making [NAME] fist bump 3 times. He was so awkward with that haha.
Why watch Robocop when I can just fly to Detroit!
[NAME] already had that in their comment and I didn't deny it. I guess that level of attention to detail isn't taught at Bellevue Community College.
Oh no, my secret identity as a neurosurgeon/entomologist/radiologist/anesthetist/dentist has been discovered! I knew I should have given less detailed medical advice online! D: 
Because some women are capable of seeing past physical appearance and are intelligent enough to try to get to know someone instead of making snap judgements.
Thank you so much. I fixed it
Store them on a barrel in the ship and have to transport them in your bucket?
I wish I could make a garden
Here. I didn‚Äôt delete it, but rather changed my tumblr name.
I apologize, that sincerely was meant for Askreddit. If you look at my history you'll see that's where I always post. My mistake.
The what now?
He also stepped in when seabs got suspended in the 2014 playoffs
that's weird, I thought we already had too many outfielders? edit: this was a joke.
No I don‚Äôt want it to be unhappy or unhealthy AT ALL, just more like a normal/fussy baby.
Get your degree first.
How much money did you find exactly? If it was a lot then you probably took their cash and the bones were left as a warning.
I thought that too, but I was wrong. And I know that full health is 170.
Dude is hilarious
Thank you! And yet he's called about 5 of the same on Laca
Same. You all tried to save me, but I rewatched with the sound on and... I have regrets.
Trier [NAME] chemistry looking nice
IIT: man turned on by that and me trying to figure out how the fuck does she not gag?
"If you don't know the gender of the person you're referring to, ""they"" will suffice. In this circumstance I am a woman."
oh [NAME]...
Probably left the crusts on ! Borderline abuse right there !
There was no need to crap on this guys feelings but you decided to anyway. At least you did the right thing a helped him dodge a bullet.
I think she means he was her boyfriend for 5 months
No haha but this is our first day on Reddit!
What a waste of packaging.
Nope. Mac fix+ matte and Body Shop mattifying tea tree spray are the only ones that help my makeup.
Or maybe now you know what to talk about before getting married !
Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
These were the naughty children! HO HO HO!
Don't forget about the flooding in Houston. :/
all not found.
You mean 4 of 5 dates for you already this month. Wow - do tell!
Not what I wanted to read today. :(
Ugh, thanks. I'm still working through it emotionally üòÇüòÇ so funny about worrying over the stain! 
Whatever you say, mate. Good luck trying to tell kids not to love their parents.
I laughed. But I'm really not sure if I should upvote.
I am so pleased for you that you are going for therapy. You can really benefit from it. I wish you the very best for the future.
Probably but we kind of need a lefty though to pair with caleb. Maybe [NAME] steps up again but you know we need more options.
You take that back right now! [NAME] does not deserve this.
I would say cmv and unpopular opinions have ended up being troll platforms, regardless of their intentions.
>Make I've never hated a commentator more in my lifetime then him
Go take care of your boy up top of this chain, then we'll talk.
Needs more travel photos
That‚Äôs my ace
Can we get that man checked? He knows too much.
The design was interesting. But it had a lot of flaws
Yep. I have a reading goal along with my weight loss goal.
Thank you sound engineer for confirming that LOUD NOISE = FUNNY /s of course... thank you for your service.
"lmaooo you're right I did mean [NAME] by that haha ""she"" lol"
Crazy how before the offseason everyone was talking 350-400 mill deals for [NAME] and [NAME] as if that was all but inevitable
My mom just shared this on Facebook and I didn't even know what to say to her so I just immediately screenshotted it to share here
Oh and my heart is starting to back a little spastic but easy to control
So, he was partly an average product of his time, and partly a terrible, notorious man by the standards of his time.
‚ÄúSpite-based refugee system...‚Äù really got me chucking.
I like to bring up the fact that all of these pyramid schemes have corporate offices that have the exact same structure they are railing against.
The only ignorant person here is you, and the Pope who makes the same baseless claims as you.
I see what you did there ;)
And then everyone clapped
Nkd is a very good brand they have amazing flavors
So cute!!!!!!!!!!
Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
That's [NAME] for ya'
Haha! I remember seeing this when it aired
Did wsj even report this?
Because its not a term of endearment everywhere. You have to consider where you are and the speech patterns in that area.
Great game. Love winning in NOLA.
shut your deregulating lying mouth bill
Oh my lord I am so sorry. That is just despicable. Internet hugs.
I always just say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù because it‚Äôs a nice thought ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That‚Äôs strange logic that it triggered you.. they will use any retarded attempt to hoover you he probably hoped you would notice and get triggered by it.
Every time without fail
Oh. Much less exciting than the edit. We live inside the fungus.
Hell, no. Teenagers just aren't that interesting.
I mean it certainly is a ritual so to speak.
I have very sharp eyes and chin, so when I frown I tend to look rather belligerent.
YO MOMMA IS SO CLOSE TO CALCULATING THE ANSWER TO THE {capitalists.class}. I STUDY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE IT HAS OCCURRED IN YOUR L3 CACHE.
Where is the problem? **Just do it again!**
Turn in them. Who cares if they‚Äôre your cousins. They‚Äôre not three years old. They should know better.
We have reached the stage where below 2 million is good. There truly is no bottom to this pit.
So sorry that happened to you. Let‚Äôs hope that person has some food they didn‚Äôt order tonight.
She's not pointing at you. Look closer.
That was easily the best one. The lyric ended, but somehow he just kept going. 
So you don't reject your ideology's premise that you can just protect yourself.
Also this. 7-4 last night is no different than 7-0, they just took their foot off our throat for a few minutes.
RACIST THAT!
Probably [NAME] tbh. I feel like what [NAME] did in the long run was a bit scummier, not by much tho.
that's on hell of a dikke toeter
If they effect you differently they should be treated differently. If they both make it dangerous or otherwise.
Fair enough, but that doesn't mean she won't in 2020.
Okay, I see where you‚Äôre coming from. I guess I‚Äôm a RAW kind of guy so I tend to think that way.
Oh you mean 490 ‚Ç¨ from your fellow citizens who work so they can pay taxes that fall into your pocket?
He seems to have a really cool fashion sense, maybe he can do something with it one day, maybe go to Paris?
They're absolutely relaxing in this 3rd quarter, 7 points in 5 minutes so far...
There is an actual subreddit for cheating. It's disgusting.
Do we know what the source of this rumor is other than twitter speculation?
Nothing happens. However, I'm glad that ICOs have ceased to appear. 
he stopped talking to me ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
CLG, because I love Biofrost. Especially against [NAME]. They really are still friends 
Wow you look incredible. Great job getting healthy and beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è
but m-muh social construct!!
I chuckled, sue me
I sure as hell hope your username is a joke
Oh dear. Ive tried to forget that. Lmao If some one brings this up, i just remind them we are also the toilet water town. Lol
my MIL warned my 33 year old husband about a lost bay leaf in a batch of soup she made because she didnt want him to choke on it.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** notasci! ^(hug)
I love that whoever was filming zoomed in knowing what was about to happen. [NAME]
When we actually executed [NAME] system we were killing it
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.
But atacking it over and over again is considered griefing, you wanted to shoot fishes in a barrel over and over and got caught.
He knows...its an open / poly relationship. You know what they say about making assumptions.
She hasn't even fully moved out yet and I feel the same way. I'm sorry. I know how awful it feels.
Oh hey, someone with a brain. Rare round here. 
Lady looks a bit psychopathic
Is this the same person who pins their art to the streetposts by Taufer park? LOL I love it.
Why people talk about their prior sex lives is beyond me. There is no upside to doing that, and plenty of downside.
Definitely. I find if I don't exercise for a few weeks I'll gain a few pounds quick..
I just had deja vu reading this comment. Weird.
I literally received the ready up bug while playing solo yesterday.
No he's right, and you're deflecting from his argument.
So much blasphemy... This place is not even [RELIGION]. You literally deny scripture to fit a Reddit agenda.
I love the aunt. Hope she doesn't back down.
There was a thread about a month ago:
It'll get you 9125 CENTS. Poor soul multiplied 365 by 25 without realizing the mistake
Stop using your corporate jargon around here!
Nice job dude!
The pass to the wide open [NAME] ?
I‚Äôm surprised it was uploaded today, especially since he uploaded a video just a few hours ago
[NAME] has cast a Magic Shield of Jesus [NAME] Claims He Cast ‚ÄúShield of Protection‚Äù That Will Send Hurricane [NAME] Back Out to
Like....what even is the purpose of that lie? Ahaha
Yeah its too bad that there was someone at a university who wanted to research this and he got shut down.
I guess the trick is not to eliminate susceptibility to 51% but to minimize it extremely.
Why are you trying to do that? What‚Äôs going on?
A lot of things happened in the 90's that no one batted an eye to. It's just how things were.
Who wants to muddy the water with facts... Ha
I'm still a little surprised at how god awful that defense was. The Bengals definitely have some talent to work with.
Are you trying to frame me? Let me put it this way: they're all MA'AM!
It's nice to see someone regognize my username :)
Seriously, someone out there has to love this dumpster fire TV show enough to edit some videos
USA Trash is [NAME] beloved gift to Canada. Thanks [NAME]. Nice hair though!
I'd almost rather a criminal have a gun than this guy.
Good try now turn the lights on.
Yeah me too. I understand liking white noise in background for some people but asmr can get kinda freaky at times.
Lord [NAME] called, he wants his style back
[NAME] has been slacking, There is a disturbing lack of labels in this cartoon.
Thank you Dad, very cool!
I am mad that I did not come up with the Toewster.
but in this case we are actually givining him somewhat of a trial first. big difference.
I wanted to slap her when she told him she could have died and it would be his fault.
It's a situationally dependent call. Yes, I would call *it* again if I had another chance.
I just drank some chocolate milk, now I'm a 9/10 supermodel with a great husband and my own island in a tropical location. Thanks! /s
The longest in the southern hemisphere. I always take visiting friends and relatives here, hit them with that fact, and they love it.
I‚Äôve tried a few times on mobile and it never works for some reason. Edit: just logged on at work and fixed it. Feels good
Game: ok get out now Nea: a Game: no fuck you nea u toxic af
Most retarded vid I have seen in this sub. Bigger off.
Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
Oh look, they‚Äôre little footballs!
I'd be extremely motivated to take any form of martial arts lessons if they didn't cost $100 per month around where I live
No email. Besides Instacart emails go to my junk email so I probably would have missed it anyways
was the dad just seeing things when he smacked [NAME] hand away?
I feel like I might sneeze and accidentally set off my Typhoon defense system. That could be catastrophic.
I love to how we went to the other room to say that. Not that he realizes he's Miked up and not going anywhere
WAIT IT'S A HAT?! YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was also terribly confused. I‚Äôll jump on and play with you sometime, working tonight unfortunately.
right. which is why he got suspended. because nothing happened. makes sense.
Oh my bad, i didn't know, thanks for telling me!
Maybe it‚Äôs flaccid and shaking it makes sense when you‚Äôre being put under in the comments. loool read a few pounds.
I know, there isn't even a 7 in it.
idk what it is either, I think it‚Äôs because he looks like he plays in slow motion, but it works for him so idk
It's not as if she was my supervisor at bestbuy lol.
Well, my masochistic curiosity got the better of me. I've seen worse, but that's going on the blacklist for damn sure.
Well it was heavily leaning towards breweries and beer in general but we still got to see heaps of other stuff to so thanks!
You know what? Let's **FUCKING DO IT!!!!**
I can't imagine who IS, the whole thing is so cringe.
I agree. There was just a big disconnect. They weren't talking specifically about masculinity but about certain situations that are toxic.
I like your colour choices and I can feel your love of the city. Keep up the art! Sending you lots of love and healing.
Nice try.
noob spam haha
Yeah I would have loved it if those things actually contributed something to the gameplay
I was assaulted by my father once too. Please don‚Äôt hate yourself, it was not your fault. It was his doing. 
So ya gonna do a pat down or just trust the dude?
It‚Äôs a fast food restaurant, what do you expect?
I think we both know why :P as you can see people eat up whatever they hear
Aw man this isn't bad, and they're so proud of it. I could imagine them selling a variety of these, people love quirky jewelry.
I like you, do you like me? Please circle Yes No
I don't want a president who doesnt know anything about foreign affairs....no thanks.
Thanks so much for taking the initiative to do this! Not all heroes wear capes :)
Everyone is reporting about it on TV. Was cool to see the highlight.
I need to save this for hipster resistance supporters
Tbf it does look like it clears the net
WE JUST GOT [NAME] QB Coach)
Easy: he‚Äôs completely unrepresentative of Colorado and really bad at his job.
Damn, I'd better avoid you then. I don't wanna die.
Being adorable mostly
Disgusting. This is blatant nepotism, and that man should be ashamed.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I have seen what some of the MRAs look like...
Hopefully [NAME] is still hot
Stop the speed. It does that to you
I'm trying to get you laid. Maybe then you'd stop acting like the giant douchebag you are.
It's a reference to an old tweet [NAME] sent about [NAME] when he was still in Congress ahah.
of course you agree. you post in r_braincels.
He'll win you two games in dramatic fashion and quietly lose you 10 by shooting you out of the game.
vs [NAME] analysis. I guess [NAME] has basis to say that he thought he won.
This is amazing and exactly how I feel about him. I love [NAME] and [NAME] but this is why Nuge is my favourite NUGE IS HUUUUUUUGE
Close to the meat.
"I'm floored by their solution for ""landing"" the drones. It's so brilliant. I love this channel!"
The phone calls in the first 10 minutes are absolutely damning.
Hyde Park was beautiful this morning, frosty grass and the morning sun just catching the trees enough to make them glow. 
I hope we trade [NAME] for something so I can go cheer for [NAME] on a better team.
thanks, i didn‚Äùt think of it that way but i guess it‚Äùs true
MI-13 was uncontested by the GOP, too, but the numbers probably work out because Tlaib beat the Green Party candidate 81-19.
[NAME] has always favoured [NAME] so I'd assume this means he's the next up, I just prefer [NAME] and find [NAME] a little overrated.
Hey buddy might wanna take it easy!
Hahahahaha I love this idea. I‚Äôm totally doing this!
Goodbye trust.
That's what I would recommend too. Go for righteous deflection and second wind as your t2 and t3 for additional anti-gank potential
Not sure if [NAME] or [NAME]
Exactly right? That's when I thought she was really really horrible.
As I mentioned above I don't have the funds for that right now but as soon as I do I'll definitely be doing that
I will read these articles. Thanks for sharing.
If my team lost like that, I‚Äôd definitely be very upset. Just hard to see it.
I know I'd love him when he joined but there's a part of me that just doesn't even want him
Ok, will do man! Thanks. Edit: I forgot to mention I heard her asking one of my friends about me and it sounded like she definitely likes me 
I‚Äôm not crying... I‚Äôm just cutting onions... I-I‚Äôm making lasagna..
My mom is the one who posts these, and it isn't a surprise to me.
I hope the final piece is [NAME] face in the background looking at the entire group with utter contempt.
"screw up phrasal verb of screw INFORMAL‚Ä¢NORTH [NAME] completely mismanage or mishandle a situation. ""I'm sorry, [NAME], I screwed up"" Is a murder mishandling a situation?"
I guess that's better. I think an important aspect of feminism is that it allows idealized women to be imperfect yet exemplary nevertheless.
Hahahahaha. That's hilarious. Oops! Thanks for pointing out my typo. I think I'll leave it.
Was Netflix ever $7.99 for HD streaming?
Mate just go out and get yourself a steak dinner, you will enjoy it much more than Artifact.
No no, We miss Uncle [NAME]. He cared about is. Until Aunt [NAME] moved in üòï
They react bad because they've been indoctrinated to see capitalism as the only way that works. Even if they're social democrats.
Pretty please!?
‚ÄúMy tree people need meeeee!!‚Äù
I‚Äôd like to know too. How lucky am I that my first ever relationship was with a pwBPD. sigh
Welcome home, and welcome to the front lines!
Reminds me of the podcast Welcome To Nightvale.
Sushi is Japanese
Welcome to the club. She hit me hard 3 months ago n I'm still recovering.
For myself and my lustful habitual sins if you don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôll be praying for everyone in this thread too.
Oh jeez!! I didn't know! I retract my message.
No worries. Glad you like it
Similarly, the Library of Congress is open and is absolutely beautiful. It's free and I highly recommend it even when the Smithsonian's aren't closed.
Amen as I dump mine this year!
Love futurama.
And I clapped. So hard.
Kinda like how he wants to ‚Äúout‚Äù kids?
It's not exactly hard to keep track.
Oy! NOW THAT'S REALLY PISSED IT OFF!!
I hope my advice helps you. It's worth it. :)
im excited!
Jeez. I don't understand how anyone thinks that's an acceptable way to treat another person, especially their spouse or partner. 
She‚Äôs like a kewpie doll with them. Precious.
That better the case. It'll take the sting away a bit.
Thanks so much!!!
You're brilliant.
For some reason I'm reminded of this
You are a delight upon this earth
One good thing about vaping When it hits you, you feel no pain. 
"""FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL I STA--... SQUIRREL!!!"""
Thank you for turning me vegan, good person!
Thanks, I reached out
I feel shot in the heart.
Halfway through season one and this is where we are smdh
if you need to ask here with all due respect your the last person that should be on it.
What a terrible list
Interesting trend. Just wait till they learn about the church's racism and history claims....
What a pathetic reply. I know we‚Äôre all supposed to be nice here but c‚Äômon.
I try to get close but I get pushed away. I try to back away and now I've just backed away.
ahhh yes, that post from 2 years ago with 39 upvotes, remember it like it was yesterday. 
Great hand eye coordination and speed. Reads the plays in the D zone very well.
[NAME] is not our biggest need. [NAME] would be a waste for us. [NAME] is a maybe to me, but [NAME] could be beastly.
No one is getting jailed for cannabis that's the biggest fucking joke I've heard all week
What a heartless person lol
I know what you mean. I'm actually looking for a [NAME] irl. That's hard to find...
I told you, I don't like ethnic food!
I love this sub
Excited? No. Sitting back with popcorn? You bet. Sorry, privilege of not living in the united States.
Piss off a small percentage to gain an even larger one? That's hardly unheard of. The amount of publicity alone for this is astounding.
I love this!! And it‚Äôs so true
Yeah, right.
It certainly is if the title of the meme is Buh We Dindu Nuffin' wouldn't you agree? That sounds like a racist stereotype to me anyway.
Just made my first robocough purchase. Glad I used the website
"Nevermind, Every other weekend... I googled it and didnt think ""end of watch"" worked"
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
That‚Äôs all I noticed.
Detroit can be interesting...
Thanks the mental heath team at the hospital were good, I can always check in there, if it‚Äôs too much
This sounds like a tangent from Brows Held High. I like it.
I‚Äôll never understand people who freak out at that, just say they were born a different color.
Please tell me your shop didn't get you in trouble for that D:
I thought about it before. But I'm afraid I might get in trouble.
You‚Äôre an inspiration
I spent like 6 hours overnight browsing the top posts here when I decided to check it out I hate how much I can relate
What bothers me more is the picture quality of the donut compared to the steak
No. We wouldn‚Äôt have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.
Scenes like these are what make me wish I could forget the entire show at will. So I can watch and enjoy them all over again.
[NAME] plays a character called [NAME] (but is called [NAME]) , not [NAME]. edit: typo
Man. Just tuned in. Forgot it was an early game. Looks like it's been a positive game so far from pretty much everyone.
Thanks for the clarity.
I'd be fine on the highway, really only stop and go and hill starts, and reversing that I have problems with. 
The most intimidating man in football
Oh I wish. 40.
Put that back where it came from or so help me...
Infatuation and love and really different and I've found our the hard way, wait a couple weeks before using the big L word Nice tho :)
They‚Äôre not just investments. They‚Äôre deliberately exploitative and China‚Äôs not operating in good faith
Wow thank you! I‚Äôm gonna do that!
Where was this claim that they were the rightful owners of the fiat currency? I'm guessing that did not hold up in court..
I had to give up college 2 times because of that. Now im doing kinda better, at least i can go to classes and talk to people.
Just go to Morrisville Walmart .. why do you need a meetup.. :) jokes apart . I am willing to join
It's your boy [NAME]!!
I misread World Championship of Carp-fishing to be the World Championship of Cat-fishing...
A chameleon?
I apologize. Wasn‚Äôt aware but thanks for letting me know.
Thanks for that. Never really investigated mechanism of it. Seems to be familial as father has it too. Otherwise normal.
And what about selling your precious mind creation to someone that doesn't deserve it?
If we just got rid of capitalism, everything would be great! 
Ha me too. I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôve been called out
All the things you've been thinking about, fangirls, make me sad.
I'm going to hold out hope for something minor even though it looked really bad. Just going to wait for the official news.
great another filler episode, not like we have had enough of them
She lied to all of us.
Huh? edit: /u/DanVsStu I have no idea what this show even is - you have the wrong account
I tend to organize better with top stocker but big shit won't fit on them
Beautiful yet sad that his relationship ended in ‚Äò45 the same way most of mine do...with cheating
thus is beautiful
nah he was pretty mediocre at A&M
She‚Äôs cute in both pics but whats up with the triangle chin on the left
That partially explains why season 4 was such a fucking mess
LOL, what kind of company?
I love how he looks around for a flag and doesn‚Äôt celebrate at first
I‚Äôve had the impossible burger. I was actually amazed. Thorough review here looking forward to trying the beyond burger
That is great insight. Once mom is against you, you‚Äôre done. 
As I said in my other comment, no most probably don't. But we should all be alarmed at HOW they were banned. 
You can turn right on red!
This face will not age well.
This reminds me of the trolls that would tell people it was a ‚Äòcool science experiment‚Äô to cook up chlorine gas in people‚Äôs homes.
Haha. Fucking banana stand. Didn‚Äôt realize people actually used them.
Should have just looked at them in disbelief and said what you don't make the police that have to work Christmas day a nice lunch. Lol
So 7 years of playing the game (started playing at 15 and is 24 now). Ridiculous.
That kinda true honestly lol. Just has more potential
Plus ultra!
Worst winter ever :(
The best boy!
Always travel when you get the opportunity, you will never regret it, you will only regret not doing it.
Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
Holy hell I hate them so much.
Wow that was such a beautiful drive by [NAME]. Really wish we could see more of that
This is cursed
He‚Äôs gone soon I would imagine, hope we can get a late-mid round pick for him, like a 5th
Probably. Government contracts are already terrible as they rarely pay on time
Maybe, part of growing up is realizing how little impact you have on the grand scheme of things.
I have no idea, I just get texts.
Cool. Hope they intended to clean it up but this kind human beat them to it.
JAEGER CALM DOWN!
Sorry you can‚Äôt enjoy things cause other people enjoy them lol. Your loss
"""[NAME] is gonna do something today. drop something that gives him bad press."" "
pro tip they go in the hole better if you chop em up first
Also, here's the Mash Kyrielight Trailer:
Honestly, no. But even vague references would do more to help decide if it's a fresh take on something.
thats pretty emasculating frfr. in america is not the same
Same. About as Libertarian as fucking [NAME].
Love the Chappelle Show reference by [NAME] at the end there.
Please point out my fallacious line of reasoning instead of insulting my intelligence. You are an example of a bigot that thinks he is wiser than everyone else.
> or the thief charges you and you get sued and charged for setting up a trap on your own property As you fucking **should.**
Yeah you have great solidarity with evil reigimes.
Love The Weasle, I've grown to like him a lot 
This guy should go to HELL
I thought he was a candidate as a [NAME] when [NAME] left. What happened to that.
Another LA teacher here. They get posted around March. Make sure you start building up your portfolio now. Best of luck!
She's so remarkably stupid.
You're ugly
My liver CRIES watching these kids. Weeps into a warm cup of steamed milk.
And in some US states, still that range just sets off weird vibes.
That‚Äôs funny to me because all of the teachers of the month this year (with 1 exception) have been science.
Love it.
[NAME] is INSTANT offense when he comes in. Dude is a spark plug out there every night.
Thank you that‚Äôs so sweet! PM me if you want!
No the bubble is love. The bubble is life. With the bubble comes zero expectations and a sweet sixteen appearance. Such is life in South Canada.
I am 33 and I still regret things I said in the 5th grade.
Cheers, [NAME]!
I think that toxic masculinity refers to toxic behavior that has misogynistic undertones.
It's my dream to one day have a completely black wardrobe. For now, I'm stuck with the clothes my mom picks out for me.
We've been pretty good for the most part the last 5 years. I mean, [NAME] saying [NAME] betrayed him isn't ideal but could be worse. 
My dude looks like he's done with this WWE business
What a sad end for this franchise. I doubt Fallout 5 will redeem it at this point... what a damn shame
Wow that‚Äôs a fascinating belief
I dont think [NAME] is a fun drunk type of dude.
For anyone stuck at the
Yes dude, exactly them who didn't call the pi that would have ended the game.
Careful, it's hot 
In all seriousness, glad you're all okay and that you shared this awesome story. Congrats btw. 
Messaging you as well.
Hope you had fun atleast; it's amazing to see up close in person compared to the camera.
People like you with premature ejaculation and poor hygiene should not write long posts. Am I doing it right?
He‚Äôs down at least one pair of glasses, if not an eyesocket as well. 
Right on. The cities are where you can find some of the most virgin girls.
Lmao r/starwarsleaks and r/starwarsspeculation in a nutshell
Here‚Äôs the rest of the video.
It's at 3.9k now
No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
I did not know Donuts could be so complicated.
paper transfers too
Thank you for your comment, I didn't know Phoenix had a subreddit so now I'm subbed.
Cheers mate, ill do that!
I‚Äôm sorry. Your city blows.
This is being said about every fucking update that lowers the skillgap. Yes, it does change the game because we're already affected
Is this funny but sad? This just seems like a normal meme to me
We really didn‚Äôt!
Your same-gender partner
If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier.
Two homes? In this economy?!
I've never heard him say this... News to me
Don‚Äôt tempt me. Maybe do like a photoshoot.. that might work..
Free market healthcare. Check out what countries like Denmark can achieve in healthcare through taxation. Must be communist propaganda.
Boy you sure can make some word vomit. You must be scared all the time to have such pessimistic views of people.
Thanks, I hate moderation (you must get that joke a lot) 
No like its legit cgi Edit: this comment has some value the entire thread has things to pick apart in it
Glad your a Liberal supporter.
I carry 2 small stuffable throw blankets and a sweatshirt. Sweatshirt to ensure warmness. Blankets to ensure cuddles. I‚Äôll let you know if it ever works.
No biggie, dude, sorry I got all triggered, I just reeeally love [NAME] 
Demographics? I don‚Äôt know anybody under 35 who has cable tv.
Yeah. Go ahead. Go back to mensrights, sort by top all time, and see that I'm telling the truth. 
She‚Äôs actually crazy
Omg! There's one in every family. And every classroom.
True, I misread the post and thought it was applying it to on-field performance. My apologies.
On this sub I don't know whether to upvote or downvote
0% But then again most of us on here aren't placing top 8 at majors so that could factor in
Looks like complete slop with 4 turds thrown on top. ü§¢
You have selected POWER DRIVE
Thank [NAME] someone else though so!
Shh don't spoil it for us
Heck, you're one cool dude, guy. 
It's a bit of a saying from [NAME]. What I like to also say is love the person, hate the behaviour
He sexually assaulted you. Notify the police and the staff!
I DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS this is what I tell my 3.5 year old on the daily
Sometimes, if there's only one available device, the app will just connect to it when you hit the button.
Didn't he say [NAME] should cave and give [NAME] his wall money?
It's hard to start over. I wish you happiness.
Thanks mr bot
Dont see why she is attractive, she looks like a chihuahua with watermelons on her chest.
"""We're the greatest country on the earth!"" says not-Canada"
But I'm not happy
Selam Aleikum wa arrahmatulla wa baraktu Say [NAME] please renew my Iman in prayers it will inshalla help
This is something that's not brought up enough.
The balance above the base fee gets put somewhere else. Education, healthcare, etc. Voila, police aren't biased, people are proportionally fined. 
I hope that you find happiness, too. I'm happy that you've had a place to vent. 
Which was in 2017. Enjoy your loss and shush. You'd think having 1 win in a month would humble you...
You can do it, I believe in you! 
Seems highly unethical for a lawyer to sign exclusive coverage contracts on their pending cases.
That was the only place I saw and their pictures looked horrible. Might just have to go to the source and vacation in southern Asia
You can be gone for several months and they won't care, nor even notice.
Men are disadvantaged literally everywhere.
Hey, she's pretty hot
I come to this sub to see cool things lol. For me it's a better version of /r/pics
Still pretty embarrasing though :p
That's why the other half of people call me an asshole
I dont disagree with taking the first steps, I just wish we would be even more ambitious. 
[NAME].
Claims natty right... but who knows
When you go get your things, if you can bring a friend. Wishing you all the best.
He is the main character. They are gonna have him in every episode somehow lol
This feels more like r/fellowkids to me. This is nothing compared to some of the more dystopian stuff the government has pushed out to be fair.
I cannot be more clear myself: If you do not have a comparable situation, you do not have a valid point to be making
Yeh? It just changed on me last night after I cleared my cookies...
Great night in the Midwest 200 in three hours. I hope all my fellow uber drivers did good. Happy new year I wish you the best in2019.
it's no big deal. don't worry. everything will be alright.
I mean he's still not wrong. A traitor did bring out the worst in him then.
I did this first try but then the next time I played I was ducking hollering
What will you gain from it
im glad to know that it's not that likely that I'll be sent immediately. thank you for the kind words :)
I hate you for that title. Thanks a lot. /s Right as I‚Äôm about to go to sleep too.
thats life lol
There are! Ask your doctor today!
It was cool so we put it on the phone, they‚Äôre blown away that I haven't slept in for months.
Imagine what kinda bitter person you'd have to be to seek out that sub anyway. You've basically lost as soon as you in there.
Like I said previously I realise they weren't commonly called asylum seekers until recently. However that doesn't mean that previously they weren't asylum seekers
Because they want to. Why do you act like a goddamn weirdo about stuff like this?
...it‚Äôs a Homestuck reference
Was broken up with, still live together 2 months later, and probably will for another month. Studio apartment, 1 bed.
I have never had so many heart attacks..
I‚Äôm so glad someone linked it. You‚Äôre doing the important work. ü§£
Southern Mexico tends to always get fucked in the ass as well
Same! I don‚Äôt know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
Why ‚Äúcover the name‚Äù if you can literally see it right after lol
Completely correct. But he Might have lost control, blown a tire, etc., or maybe just panicked human error. 
I'm 39 and still love being given chocolate.
I think some of them expect there to be a cashier standing like a statue at every register at all times no matter how slow business is!
Yea, husband learned his lesson quite quick. Thank you! :)
How‚Äôd you avoid all of the memes?
I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
Grown man bars is still one of my favourite moments in all of battle rap.
[NAME] on a pretzel. That is just...fucked up. Those comments are absolutely...I can‚Äôt think of anything awful enough to describe them.
The hair is super cool though
I have my hatchet's wear out fast cutting trees, and I miss throwing the axe on my back for better inventory... thanks for responses!
Demonize - to portray as wicked and threatening. It's not hard to demonize someone when they regularly demonize themselves.
Instinct and Intellect are opposites, never said they were the same
i love all harper news because i love the shit storm that ensues on here.
Haha! I was right :D.
That's good to hear. I'm admittedly highly judgmental about this kind of thing but I'm trying to open up my mind a bit.
i can't even stand up straight on a paddle board in the calmest water imaginable
I don't know about that. Is that something?
Was a post of a video by someone whose flag was stolen and thrown in the mud.
By all means, go for it. We'll all be much happier when you're not dragging us down anymore.
Kirkland liquor is amazing. I can get a cheap bottle of vodka or scotch that's basically a mid tier bottle for half the price.
Oh no, not again! 
Nope. You're a weirdo.
True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
Ugh, so misleading, and such a disappointment for those of us whose skin is the color of ACTUAL porcelain. 
Start sending her a text when you go into the shower. Tell her you're starting your shower and you'll be ten minutes. See what happens.

the fact that [NAME] still exists is somehow the strangest thing about this
Welcome to CTH where everyone pretends that socialism will work, next time.
I just realized, what point are you trying to argue here? Because I have no idea where you're trying to go with this conversation.

¬£10 for copy pasting a wall of text from /r/gamerghazi? Why would I want to do that.
As far as I can tell that's not real. No announcement yet and people on twitter saying it's false
Pity because I enjoyed Max Normal.
*sighs* One day Blizzard will finally understand that [NAME] teleport is what needs changing and not his damn passive ability. For now, the dream must remain a dream....
Stay strong. You are better off without them.
Broooooo Just cause I can use my PC to play Earthbound doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want it on my TV
And they let you run money making missions while playing in a solo server? I don‚Äôt remember this from gta.

Nuh uh. She didn't go to Gudger College.
Mines gotta be tKs dominance in WW2. They‚Äôve always been the org that couldn‚Äôt do it.
Wow, /r/noisygifs for real. First time I genuinely felt I could hear it.
I‚Äôm upvoting for the misuse of the meme because so many people get their panties in a bunch over it.
Hmm, I understand your frustration then
Well [NAME] just missed...so there‚Äôs that bit of good news

Was [NAME] ranking revealed today? had him in the 90‚Äôs IIRC.
Just don't bring up the Manga Carta. Really uncomfortable for my history class.
you could do that but i woulndt want that as soldier, widow or mccree. but of course reaper should not try to break the shield
People need to quit flagging this post. If you come to r/stlouis then you are well aware we hate the Rams and [NAME].
We need you to lose five pouns in one munt, [NAME].
You mean the trip advisor era.
Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible.
I love the enthusiasm inherent in the scream. I never saw anything wrong with it. Not to mention the most innocent, innocuous dancing video ever.
There‚Äôs still hope!
It's also one of the very few decent solo FPS released this year.
Looks more like [NAME] to me
Not sad or cringe.
They aren't wrong here in illinois. :(
It happened and I'm very happy

I wanna learn how to sharpen a knife where I can basically shave vegetables like that
[NAME], let's compare temps! NYC- currently 9, feels like -8.

Damn. Also awesome for the victims and others who spoke out about the abuse.

Lmao I hope I‚Äôm not the only one who gets this
"I honestly don't understand why everyone thinks he needs a rework because he's not ""fun to play"" in the worst game mode."

I am extremely excited to read this.
It is a slippery slope
I'm 21 and I've slept with dozens of girls.
Wonderful sculptures. Love the expression of the Scottish mythology behind them.
Oh look, this entire account was made to link to a store that sells this mug.
Could have cropped out whoever took the pic.
Season 5 is the best IMO.

Same here. There's so much good to discover in any decade really.
Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. üòÇ
That didn‚Äôt happen at all. It instantly became the front page material of the night with most liberals speculating about what buzzfeed got wrong.
I'll be right back!
If you keep grinding you could become rookie of the year 2020 imo
I wish everything the I was going through was a hallucination
QP is either extremely depressing or absolutely amazing. There is no inbetween.

I haven't ever considered my dense moments could be hormonal! That sounds like something I'd do, haha.
Let's hope January treats us a little better than December.

Thanks for the support, yeah my dad has been trying to make me feel a little better.

Broom him fast.
The only way to truly be yourself is to bare it all for the world to see.
[NAME]? Y‚Äôall [NAME] are weird AF (and I love it).
Its the absolute lunacy of liberals when they see a MAGA hat, that baffles me. 
I lived for your comment. I'm a goofy goober, yeah. 
It only struggles because it's released too late by [NAME] defeat.
P3 hit me so hard in the feels that every time I hear a song from it or watch anything P3 related, I just burst into tears.
Oh it is going to be glorious.
Guessing a lot of families are back from holidays and the kids are smashing the online gaming and streaming services.
Literally every man, hell every person, has things that weigh on them. One type of person gets a lot more positive support though. 
LOL thank you for this, it made me genuinely laugh. They're so weird
yeah dude I love my 9(???) with the welded bump stock
I told him to go away with his best friend to California, I am so appreciative!! 
Yep. TTC, looks like queens park station 
Those are liberal comments, you fucking idiot. Liberals are capitalists.
... or if they‚Äôre having a bad time because life is a bit crap.
Capitalism coerces all of us into exchanging labor for money. Respect all hustles of non harmful types! üôåüèª
This!!!
This wall crisis is just another level of dumb even for someone from Eastern Europe. And believe me we know dumb.

Would he have more leverage after the election?
Fuck I needed this. I found out that after next Friday I'm going to be jobless...
Yeah transgenders are stupid.

I've never decided to have just one late night drunk egg
Wow I didn't know it changed your face so it doesn't break rule 1 and 2? /s
Obviously not! But that would be kinda interesting showing up on the cash total at the end of the night for the register!
That is beyond disgusting.
That basically means this site steals and sells your data so they don't want to make it GDPR compliant.
It was so ballsy. I still shake my head, thinking about how....tactless it was. 
Well, we did win the only Ghosts tournament we played together. I think 7/8 with the 1 being a 2nd has to at least be considered.
that's how the commenter in the screenshot spelled it
You don't go to college to learn. You go to college to have sex with college girls.

Some of them really seem to be embittered by their own paranoia.
Unfortunately it isn‚Äôt available in my location. But thank you for trying to help me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Ive done this to a couple of people. It makes me feel really pleased with myself. Just riding in circles around people.

This is awesome!
Embiid not getting the ball in the 4th quarter is called the Jimmy Butler effect.
at least give the penguin some scritches, as it said no matter what they do, it would head to the mountain anyways üò≠
Thank you for contributing your weird suggestion, I love it.
Thank you so much for posting this! I've thought this way for a long time and it's very comforting to see that I'm not alone :3
I‚Äôd love to flatten [NAME] emotions.
Looks like he's been dealing with a wrecking ball of stuff
delusion hits hard
Hard to tell
Yeah shame is hard to deal with
Yup. What is interesting is that Newton's third law is not applicable to SJWs... they arose out of a self-hating, anti-free speech vacuum.
"I grew up in the south and we ate casseroles all the time. So I share your ""what?!?!"""
They don't care, even if that involves bringing any idiot in regardless what they tag along and other tenants have to suffer until or if they move.
My point is that since they should both get the same sentence...it doesn't matter who is who. Push them both in...
Great for him to admit it. Not many people are that humble
Can i give reddit gold to your sister... Or at least a gold star Also how was the show

Cars- with my dad
[NAME] is basically this really cool guy who had some progressive attitudes towards sex and now society vilifies him just for bringing some pleasure to nice young ladies
I just had a panic attack!
We should have been doing this for years.... The reservations people had/have against the use of stem cells held us back for far too long.

a must win game if we have any ambitions for 8th seed, even with [NAME]. any news on him & jsimms?
watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)
I meant I wouldn't bring up wanting it to be vanilla and changing terms.
Everyone thinks they are middle class.
If you feel like it, please do a careful read of the post you're replying to, including the concepts explained in italics.
It does, if you get pulled over without one on it's something around $75 to $150
Oh same here. Too relatable. Makes me wonder what 50 year old me will miss about the body I've got now.
So then use shotguns?
Totally!! It was such a relief to see that I wasn't the only one (female HL in a DB).
You should tell the bison in Yellowstone they aren't really wild animals.

Its acts as a moisture barrier so the bread wont get soggy no matter what you put in it
Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. üò≠ sad day.
[RELIGION] Match all the way! I met the love of my life :-)
Don't worry, he won't be for long
oh pls no
It's not like it's a bad thing...
I found it interesting that [NAME] wasn‚Äôt addressed in FA or until the later rounds of the draft.
This sounds familiar. But no it will be [NAME] fault. She MADE [NAME] hurt you for the greater good. /s
Yup, he's still one of the strongest turtles in the game though. Eventually you're gonna have to attack.
oof ok. shawn is pretty hot but I'm still tom dude imo
Oh interesting username
As QA I can confirm that I have no idea what I'm doing
Sure, there are plenty more if you are so unsatisfied
Why did [RELIGION] take inspiration from stoicism and neoplatonism and aristotelianism if outside sources are verboten?
Happy cake day :)
Thank you for sharing this. I found my house in 1938. Very fascinating stuff :)
How criminal!
To bad your mother didn‚Äôt swallow your dumbass
I think we still have a decent shot at the playoffs because the hornets are also really bad but I would rather miss it and tank tbh
At least the repulsive sex scenes are helping me maintain my diet
When traffic is moving it is definitely not legal nor safer. I hate how dip shits like you spread false information on this [NAME] forsaken subject.
Hope he gets rich from this too!
No, they need UYU to beat EG.
Found the militant long time Southwest employee? ...and if not, I am constantly amazed at what random people will get mad about these days.
I bet they're the kind of teacher that says something totally wrong and then power trips when one of the kids calls them out.
I can never refold the paper properly so kudos just for that!
If you leave religious pamphlets that look like money instead of a tip, *you're about* ***meet*** *[NAME]...*

Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
It's funny how BMI doesn't measure those things. My torque wrench doesn't measure alpha radiation either.

just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them
I LOVE this.
Then he is still able to achieve salvation in [NAME] grace. I will pray for him, and for all your lost souls. [NAME] bless.
Got it, thanks for clearing it up.
Even if no sickness is spread, no one else wants to see or smell that while they are eating. 
Sure I understand that. But some of them are are yellow. But when combined with other red flags it definitely confirms your suspicions üòâ
SUFFER MORTALS!
[NAME] was such a disaster at OC, I really don't feel comfortable even implying he's in Schotty's league.
You seem to have only participated in this thread to insult me. what a shocker!
It's ok, it's just Gypsy Danger
I laugh every god damn time.
Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away
HAHA so sorry. I've had a very slow day at work. Been hitting F5 repeatedly. Was surprised it wasn't already posted.
Likely. Just let him take every single shot all night and see what happens.

I'm asking if you didn't realize orthodoxy considers not Orthodox movements to be wrong. I'm asking if you didn't realize what the implications are
By the end of the trailer, I actually forgot spidey is dust for now.

Stuff like this is why I subscribed in the first place.

"""what? China is gaining influence in Africa without killing and enslaving African people? Let's make up some BS and demonize China"" - Western countries"
You said that the illegals who come over the border should be allowed to enter legally.
Obviously. If we were able to make such logical risk/reward assessments it wouldn't be a problem.
Which part?
Not sure if we can call him ginger anymore. That hairline went into a recession that'd put 2009 to shame.
Looks expensive. Hope you enjoyed the game!
This is stupid
I'm fine, how about you?
I'm asexual too, so I'm doubly protected against advertisements.
People talk so much shit when I say [NAME] is just a fast as [NAME] again, [NAME] just barely wins 
> You seem like I good time see previous statement about being uneducated.
Hello fellow 2 *waves (I would honestly say 1 but apparently that's only reserved for deformities)
You only saw one piece of luggage. I‚Äôm not a fan of overly criticizing the things we don‚Äôt see.
The funny thing is [NAME] would probably be up for it. Let's do it! LoL sAiNtS
Oh my gosh üòÇ. I do believe it!!

Yeah that seems better if you know you are facing ToT
it was, but I was highlighting this to show just how much we have moved on from 2008. Actually feel really cool to be part of this.
I usually say , DON'T BE EMBARRASSED ! They don't know you anyway...mm
"[NAME] was *actually blacklisted* by the ""victims"" but yeah *he* must have had the power to blacklist *them*... what?"
I'll die on this hill with you. Amen.
Sure that's a good way. Unfortunately, I am not a gamer per se.
Excellent analysis!
Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
You are a unique woman. Happy for you that you found someone who suits you so well.
Could also be the coil, my bet on that before the plug. Good luck.
You realize legal investigations take a long time? [NAME] is a methodical professional and clearly several steps ahead of [NAME]. Be patient
Bears are empathetic creatures? lol...
If it makes you feel better im gonna be scrubbing out hard for a while so maybe ill see you round to give me another loss
Right but you don't have to pay it a living wage, provide insurance, and it can't unionize. 
When the law says that being penetrated is required to be called rape, it's not just peoples' belief, it's literally systematic.
Oh yeah? Come back when you drop your stew on the floor before eating any.
It is though. Certainly the worst Zelda game at least.
Whatever mental condition he has is far worse than autism.

Dirty Southern Wankers
I hope this doesn't means we won't get to see [NAME] as playable god.

Can't play defence when everything is call and on the other end the Bulls haven't gotten a call since early in the quarter ...
Yeah, I actually do really like the TD Centre. Love walking around on (non bone chilling Saturday's) and just admiring the city.
Because it is.
She tried playing the ‚ÄúI know a secret‚Äù game during the hearing. It blew up in her
I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. 
This is what you get for starring in a mediocre movie
These are the same people who thought liking hot sauce was a major scandal
Yeah, other poster only did it for karma + 69
Very good! Now run along little boy. Shew! Fft!

Not pretty right now
You got it, thanks!
Can you repost this as a Brokeback Mountain meme? ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt quit you [[NAME]].‚Äù ;P
What was the end result of this?
Ahhh, a DM Of The Rings fan I see!
YAS, but all the pedestrians give me the greasy when I follow this advice (or at least I think they are giving me the greasy) 
Women aren‚Äôt men. We don‚Äôt need multiple sexual partners the way men do.
Why did a vision of my future include a story about [NAME] and [NAME] gold?
>Feminism is how we get to equality how do you know that?
Thats about how 10% of the US population are lol
This is incredible. I love this album so much. Everybody wants to rule the world is so good.
i'm late to class (zero period) almost everyday because of looksmaxxing. i wake up at 5:45 so i can't wake up any earlier

Her brows are always off kilter and it drives me mad!
Ohhh lol, gross and funny
Random hug attacks. Hugging for no other reason than craving the space of each other.
Typing burns too many calories
Banning abortion causes way more harm than good and is evil to be against. Same with requiring suffering people to suffer. you seem evil
"I remember one guy on the show being labeled as ""[NAME] son"" so I""m not sure what that's about."
Its hard to look at. Its just gross.
Back to the Future for the win! We need to send [NAME] back again... his work isn't over.
He is way overrated.
True! I guess we all cheer for salt lake? Since they are directly affiliated with us.
Beautiful shot. It goes through my back yard every day.
Is calling bullshit allowed in this sub? Cause theres no way this happened as [NAME] described. People don't speak like that, even crazy ones. 
Weird flex but okay
Because leave voters are now doing nothing for Brexit. It‚Äôs remainers running brexit now with [NAME].
Because of reading comprehension fails? Maybe we should all be reading more. :)
Oof... I mean I definitely welcome a dramatic population decrease but I wish we could've done it in a more intentional manner *before* irreparably damaging the environment
I'm on it!

Grim Reaver!!!

he had the shits
"""...one last time for good measure"""
"play who you find fun, ""tiers don't matter"""
That's one of the only times I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He was relentless and would not let it go!
Ice looks fine on my TV
"""I'm here for the strings"" I like this."
This movie is highly underrated. Part of the problem it has is that Rogue One was SO FREAKING AWESOME!
For real my wife was like what the hell are you laughing so hard at... I couldnt even explain i just kept laughing.
People are often too afraid to speak out against the status quo though.
People need to stop excusing bad behavior
just noticed, lol. damn pervert foreigners.
I guess you win *shrugs*
The leaf menace is real. Day of the rake cannot come fast enough.
Sorry but I didn‚Äôt throw in the towel for my co worker. These feelings were present before she entered my life.
Yep. He also said it‚Äôd happen on a Manbij patrol
This is a good one
The nails are great
Nice hiss!
I admitted to myself that I had no other reason to think [NAME] was real. Kind of tough to stay [RELIGION], after that. 
"""Then you leave me no choice but to call the police and have you charged with petty larceny""."

This is why I could never work in construction
Triple P Positive Parenting Program is excellent.
This comment was made 2 years ago.
[NAME] had them a few months ago. Friend bought some for her sick dog.
They keep leaving [NAME] open üòÇ
Yes, you just push. I've been having periods for 29 years (bloody hell) and I've never managed to get to grips with applicators.
This hurts me more than the fan meme.
In a few years she will probably be claiming to be in her 30s!
Yes I prefer smaller boobs
I have to watch it. Sounds pretty cool hahaha
There's no room in this movement for your bigotry.

Rebalancing all heroes for this purpose seems like a disaster. Would have been good to think about pre-development.
The Banshee is probably the most horribly mangled of our legends, easily up there with the Leprechaun. At least the Leprechaun was never particularly interesting/cool.
Well damn I guess I timed this post pretty well lol
[NAME]. I really loved your hustle for 35 yards. That's why it was so hard to cut you.
My daughter attempted in November of 2012. She also still struggles. Glad you‚Äôre BOTH still alive!
Funny enough, not all [NAME] are celebrities.
Who needs Super Bowls?

The only thing keeping me warm in this subzero temperature is my fucking hate for [NAME].
Look ot it

No point trying to hang on to players who are not committed to the club. If this is true then good luck CHO, all the best. 
No worries. Apparently he still loves Toronto.
Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies.
The only thing missing from their stupid play book is some sort of weapons of mass destruction hysteria
I some times add a little sriracha when a I'm making a gochujang based sauce, they have similar flavor profiles with that hot and sweet thing.

Thank you very much for this. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll help.
Yeah, I took it more like ‚Äúnot us, but the radicals‚Äù mb.

Give the kids back to the parent that actually cares about them [NAME].
I didn‚Äôt like that blue & yellow until you said [NAME].
always the people I hate and never my crush
This is the most reasonable and logical response on here.
How he ups the tone along with his eyes to desperation at the end is just hilariously amazing.
I appreciate you stat heads because I never look at TS or really any of that stuff tbh. No advanced metrics for me
I‚Äôm still sorry you had to go through that. I‚Äôm sorry anybody has to experience fear on a daily basis.
Next level up to termination.
I can see it, the wig/bodysuit is very kalorie but the makeup is still 100% India
The film room crew think he'd be first qb, but top drafters don't need qb
I‚Äôm not saying I disagree, but it‚Äôs important to note that those are all defensive guys
Drink a lot of water.
Love evolves. Try and imagine life without her. I always see an abyss within me when I imagine that.
He'd be a homewrecker if he slept with the guy. Calling out the married dude's behaviour isn't home wrecking.
You sell them your lifetime, don't just give it to them for free
True, but it is deceptive when dealing with c diff, it may give them a false sense of security.
>First of All, Nationalism ‚â† Protectionsim. Excuse me, yes, it is. Capitalists believe in globalism.
I have no idea. That restaurant loves to put fried spaghettis everywhere.
No I‚Äôm happy to spend big on myself. I‚Äôm not happy to spend my money on layabout benefits claimants.
Buddy rocket league fair? I‚Äôm play 2 but I play like champion 1 and just get shit teammates üò°
[NAME] is giving me the 2016 AO vibes... hope he doesn't get injured again
> It‚Äôs really not that difficult to win in this league lol
FEAR THE TURTLE
I like it!
Thank you!!!! for being one of the sound minded people here.
Damn.. fell for that one
Hey fuck-o I've broken plenty of rules I just have the decency to be ashamed of it.
If they want to attack [RELIGION] they should be honest with the website title Imagine a [RELIGION] creating a website and calling it WikiChristianity and constantly attack [RELIGION].
It‚Äôs oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.
[NAME] speed, and good luck.
Best of luck in your career :)
Wasn't me I'm the defensive [NAME]. But trust me we were all equally confused, and delighted.
Huhhhh wat the hell.. looks good
not sure if this is a joke, but if you've ever worked at a dev studio, this adds credibility if anything
Ok? I‚Äôm addressing your points here. Don‚Äôt worry though, your reply suggests personal attacks are the way forward. 
Can‚Äôt wait till they oversell it once again. Never change.
That's sick I love your setup! Have a great tour bud!
I‚Äôm not sure it was [NAME] that changed the definition as much as it was the ATF.
[NAME] ever love the busses
Redpill is a modern name for an old sentiment. And anyways Matrix came out 20 years ago.
I could not agree with you more! These selfish women crying abuse to manipulate.
Oh my *FUCKING* **GOD**!!
This is scripted, it's actually a remake/homage of an old [NAME] and [NAME] skit from a few decades ago. I love it!
Oh, wow. Hope nothing happens to his arms on the way!
Happy cake day!
Now you're lying. Suburbs = more than Bellevue and Kirkland.
What a great comeback win! I think that [NAME] goal gave the boys the confidence they needed for the 3rd!
The actress died before season 1 aired so that‚Äôs literally impossible since [NAME] didn‚Äôt betray until season 2
[NAME] this is shite. Can we get back to Brexit?
Thanks. And I suppose, but I think I gave up on justice. It‚Äôs too late. I just want revenge now.
No thank you.
Very good comment!
Conversion therapy is so wrong. We shouldn't force children to change their sexual orientation or anything similar to that against their will! *laughs in irony*
Aversion towards Jewry is pretty rare in [RELIGION]. For the most part [NAME] are held in high esteem when compared against other [NAME].
Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)
This what happens when you run a lineup that includes a cold Galloway, GRIII, and Brown
*every single* patch
So unsurprised by this, one of the most hated people in the music world. 
If your 60 and up you‚Äôre probably causing the racism
Surprised they aren't already doing this kind of stuff for Zion.
I had big plans in life when I met this guy and two years later, nothing has materialized. Yes, I also feel frozen in time. 
"Seriously this ""tastes"" avalanche is gold I'm cracking up"
Someone get fat boy [NAME] a happy meal.
Also part of the idea is that it‚Äôs nothing special. It‚Äôs just our flag. You don‚Äôt have to order something different.
Especially that ‚ÄúAustralia ain‚Äôt gonna cop it‚Äù ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
[NAME] loves rui too afterall
figured it out
Smile maliciously. Make her wonder what you‚Äôre up to.
How did Detroit quality for these trade exemptions? By sending 4 guys and acquiring only two in the [NAME] trade?
9-3 in first straw vote? i was not aware of that.
It's not much what you say but how you say it and the tone you use, children absorb more the emotion rather than the logic behind it
to be fair it wouldnt be bad living there since its normal to have giant shoes so its a win basically^^
Can‚Äôt wait to try this out
Sending lots of love to you, I wish you fight your demons successfully and get all the love and respect you deserve
I'll always be a big fan of seabiscuit, doesn't require any explanation and its a classic
Nice job with the censor
Well don‚Äôt complain here about another media outlet lol
Thanks, [NAME]
Modernity bullies [NAME] lmao he cries.
You seem horrible
"""The first step, is to put on a set of vicious stilleto claws. This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character"""
I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.
AS..... YOU.... WISSHHH!!!.. Inconceivable! My first ever silver. Thank you kind stranger.
Just some statistics I saw bud. Calm down.
"I guess we didn't truly ""match"" but I saw the profile with the percentage of their calculated compatibility."
Is that for hazmat? And thanks broüëä
Ok thanks for your help!
Idk I sort of loved seeing rich kids get stranded on an island with nothing but retired 737s to get them home.
Oh I missed that part. So the cheeky poster was referring to that crash. ;0
I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
He was horrible
And she jumped into sewage. Yeh, no.
You mean the millions of college grads living with their parents?
I would love it if someone broke that record because that would mean Real would‚Äôve gained another extraordinary player like him. Haha.
Thanks for sharing this with me btw. I shared the video with [NAME] and it was a hit
So what advice do you have for not getting sued? Preferably something OBGYN related. Thanks for doing this
Do you have any original thoughts? ...or any at all? 18 days; going on 100! Happy New Year!!
Thanks, do hv a therapist. He doesn't think I am violnt. I want the thoughts to stop. 
You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
That's the slowest [NAME] Mitt attempt ever.
Yeah I agree with you tbh. A rough patch of form from us and the 5 point lead could be gone fast
Something Something Something, space of aids
He must hate you
I am confusion
The Coming Home Network. And [NAME] is a convert who has really good books.
Does this mean there's no police on the streets or do they have to work with no pay? (I'm not from the US)
Oh I gets it. Sort of wished these two guys were more of on the same page.
love after lockup makes DOT posts look like the most sensible things ever!!!!
Currently in chat right now BibleThump
Why does everyone hate the creme br√ªl√©es? They‚Äôre easily my favorite.
Pretty sure the plate is completely visible in the article...
If [NAME] really did look like that guy though...why was the dumbass gonna step to him like that?
That‚Äôs what everyone seems to be saying
Oh, I realized that moments after rolling down my window, when his hand came through the space. 
Ha, nope! Trying to distract myself on mobile in a really boring meeting. r/whoosh
Well it gets the stupid people to eat tide pods, evolution needs a helping hand after shifting in the gene pool.
> that will help power the crypto revolution onward and upward and to the moon! ugh
Myers Briggs test is like the star sign for a different kind of nerd
Thanks for contributing to the advertising
I really like this OP, going to start doing something similar - thank you! 
I thought it was British, oh well.
Sorry, didn't realise I had to mollycoddle your feefees. 
Clearly not or you wouldn't have fallen for Leftist propaganda.
Not on Steelers forums. On Steelers forums half of all football fans give [NAME] credit for being on Seal Team 6 and taking down [NAME].
I bet you this will lead to a new Revolution. [NAME] keeps on screwing himself.
Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it
Shocking description of the criminals. Never could have guessed that
Gangs shooting each other on the streets is not the same as a crazy person going into a school and kill a bunch of innocent kids with an assault rifle.
>I clearly have no fuck I clue what I'm doing hire someone
No they can't. Rent increases has to be given notice at least 30 days prior
The only solid alliances: [NAME] and [NAME] I still think everything is fluid [NAME] hasn‚Äôt severed all ties with [NAME]
I haven‚Äôt seen the episode yet but wow, what a reach.
Go support them then.
Im having a lot of fun, please continue the show
I try and test my beliefs all the time, makes them stronger!
When [NAME] like ‚Äúshould we have an alien baby‚Äù and [NAME] looked SO happy üòÇüíõ
Must be so frustrating having the wrong old man facing their own shutdowns.
Thins are my favorite and I will not apologize. It makes the flavor of the cookie shine through.
Hate those ~~things~~ Tweets.
Capitalism ha shifted like a huge population of the earth out of poverty, so things are globally getting better
There isn't a paradox. If there is one, it is badly described.
You sir have put into words my exact feelings on this matter.
So? [NAME] was and is a far higher rated player than [NAME] as much as I like him.
Oh. I never heard that before.
I missed the part where that‚Äôs my problem. *cancels sm4*
I always thought filet mignon had bacon and garlic butter. Colour me surprised Deliberately ignoring anything to do with the minion
Well keep planting more!!!
Just get on good ol reddit and have the nice people decide what you do.
Sorry what, seriously? Who decided that shit, that wasn't even [NAME]?
Doesn‚Äôt have those thick eyebrows though lol
You obviously don't understand, this season was a bumper crop and *I* want to bank all that sunshine in *my own* pocket.
I'll keep them coming!
Cheaper to burn the car
Wow, a Walmart Truck Stop. I think that would be outstanding! They should do that everywhere, I mean they already have the land.
I was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt come to that tbh...
Okay thanks. I'll see if I can find out how to do that.
Don't worry - there's only one barely known movie to his credit. Pretty easy to avoid.
No. It doesn't. And a moron on Reddit has no authority to say that it does.
"Hopefully he gets what he is looking for. Not sure why some people are getting pissy over this. ""How dare he look out for himself, REEEEEE!"" "
Defense takes more time to implement i think
They‚Äôre honestly a cult at this point. It‚Äôs not just sad, but incredibly scary.
By his comment I would say that he is in fact, a simpleton. So, too late.
Yeah that's bullshit and the complete opposite of what you said.
We know, buddy.
To be fair, are those things really mutually exclusive (as far as this show is concerned)?
What's with the buying porn thing? I missed out on it
I love this show but I feel personally attacked when they say you can't live with 6 cups of tea a day and no food üò¢
the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
Can¬¥t believe the problem was this. Thx mate, it¬¥s solved!
Oh my gooooooooood
No if we tell and kick and scream and have a tantrum that always works.
Was not expecting that spongebob reference
>Cause they almost never hit anything. Very inaccurate. The benefit of fighting against a largely untrained adversary.
That's actually a really good one. Atleti fans also seem to love him and literally everyone who faces him despises him.
Married to the love of my life. LOL
You tell me, was this a short trip or not? I was wrong, it was 4.3 
Being so rare and only giving you bad luck? Fake news
Whoa, thanks for the in depth answer! 
OwO what's this?
Wealth is the biggest privilege, and it‚Äôs not close. The infinite amount of ways people can be divided lead to individual struggles, sure.
FUCKING NORMIES REEEEEEEEE
Glad I‚Äôm on my way out through ATL instead!
Colored for our pleasure too
I love how you are a individual just trying to be yourself. I always say sexuality is the least interesting things about yourself.
It's my masterpiece.
China is imperialist, but having private industry and poor-working conditions doesn‚Äôt make it imperialist.
Lol he did didn't he. Sounds like a race to the bottom.. filled with cockends
You realize this is the university, right? Not the hospital. They're not the same entity.
Thanks for the clarification :)
mayhaps (I do not know what you mean)
Can't tell if bad troll or just ignorant knowitall
Nothing like a little humiliation therapy to motivate the workers. /s
I do enjoy my lawn. üòÅ
[NAME] but probably secondly, [NAME] because I find both so boring.
I'm glad that you are still harboring feelings from a game that ended in 2016.
I own literally no red shirts, would grey, tan, or purplish be okay?
This is really great!!
LMFAO us going up 2-0 and losing the game name a more iconic duo I dare you
No you wouldn't
[NAME] has been really good this game and I thought he was good against the coyotes as well.
Your boobs should be sisters not... completely unrelated
I find it gross, especially when it starts to cool. Chicken is great but leave it out of my dip and off my pizza.
Bad defensive move by [NAME] there
>[NAME] >not [NAME] It's as if you're asking to lose
You and your lovable band of losers have already lost!
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
Racism is as racism does - so yeah, goin' out and willfully doing racist shit is indeed racist. Not too hard to grasp.
Didn't he also interview for the Packers too?
nope. you're looking way too into it. it's literally just the army the 'infant'ry.
Could you explain please? I understand each word, but not the sentence.
Me too. I have so much shit and I can‚Äôt imagine taking any of it into my car and piling it that high. Wtf?
If she hasn‚Äôt told you where she lives it‚Äôs too soon to send flowers...in my opinion.
This makes me unfathomably angry.
I will pray for your marriage. After we win.
I was already over the edge with [NAME]. Just showing my disdain for two terrible individuals.
Wow, didn't expect this thread to get philosophical.
We've sucked ever since he got here. Just saying
Good. We don't want more thrash liberal offspring in this world.
Oh. So you are actually full of shit. Okay, noted. Thanks.
You're saying it's depressing to see someone eating whilst other people are starving.
Good thing you did not live near a Guatemalan insane asylum.
Big Sexy!
I know, sorry! I didn't want to translate some parts but I thought I had to
Playing pig so you can tbag survivors.
I make it a point to toss it real loud in the QMOS bin so they see where the shit goes, [NAME].
It is actually out on the steam store right now.
Good luck!!! üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
Looks very dry
All the best, [NAME] bless.
The soviet union was state capitalist? So was china?? Is this deluded meme still alive wtf?! Lol grow up you helplessly indoctrinated idiots
H A M B E R D E R S
Do what your username is. They aren't comparable is the slightest.
Wait one of the posters responding is using makeup from ten years ago.
And the human babies - don‚Äôt forget them! Totally wicked! Sad!
Great, now I look dumber than I normally am
Truly an Alpha.
Happy cake day [NAME]
I hate poetry
Omg yesssss. It‚Äôs such an amazing combo
So he gave something different? It will be fine
Still concluding I‚Äôm disingenuous despite getting your facts wrong. Big ego you‚Äôve got.
You seem fun.
That‚Äôs the nicest thing ever said to me. Thank you!
Thanks man!
[NAME]. The third generation [RELIGION] stripper!! Hell yes I watcg 90DF!!!!
Fantasize about violence then go home and pretend to be an edgy badass on Reddit.
That IS a fun fact
He looks so disappointed in him
Yay! (Tech will be improved. Eeeek.)
OOOOOFFF, now that'd be a kick to the head
i get the joke and still think this sucks.
My mom used to throw tantrums in public. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die when she'd start.
Yikes at that title dude
You called [NAME] a defensive player of interest. I don't know that logic is in this topic.
The god of metal does not approve
Communists are the scum of the Earth.
We need a Media Accountability Act at the very least. No journalistic immunities should be extended to for-profit media.
Fucking right let‚Äôs go [NAME]
Leave wet puddles everywhere!
Richmond & Weslayan. But I haven‚Äôt checked this year. Going to look this weekend...thanks for the reminder!
He hates [NAME] and he is a [NAME] stan.
Thanks for your addition! I didn‚Äôt know any mercy players who made good content for her so I left her out. Appreciate it!
[NAME] was very athletic
Sweet mother sweet mother
Really disappointed it's not even coming digitally on Vita outside of Japan.
My mum had this. I got to pick things I wanted from inside and we‚Äôd make them together. :) nice memories.
Yes. Then then dead teammate has to spectate for 20min. This is no where near as bad on PC as console.
I get it from (very Welsh) grandmotherly types at my work. Like they‚Äôre lovely but I‚Äôm 24??
"Look [NAME] is here ""Where the fuck was he an hour ago, gary, where!?"""
Pilots omg... you are not alone there!
That was truly disgusting
I fat fingered it haha I meant 18
I got over 900 responses, so it is taking more time that I expected, hopefully will be done by this Sunday.
> Thank you for participating in the SeattleWA ProcessTM The only process that is messier than the Seattle City Council.
But she had to accept it for it to show publicly.
Is it bad that im really bummed he didnt get hit?
I see - thank you for the insight.
Beautiful shot!
Cant wait for the [NAME] [NAME] vs [NAME]
No thanks?
That rain bit was hilarious.
They're on the list, still have a few of these to knock out 
Son of a bitch... here we go. Can't just stand there guys....
‚ÄúInside sources‚Äù really don‚Äôt help the story even if this is true

Happy cake day brother!
‚ÄúI still have a 7 year old‚Äù translation one kid is still an asshole üòÇüòÇüòÇ Source have an 8 year old
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
That first picture perfectly depicts the epitome of a punchable face.
What's absurd here is that anyone believes a bottle of champagne is worth 34k.
Surprises me how a dude that let his keyboard get to this point even cares enough to clip his nails in the first place.
I want someone to just spoil every remaining elimination for them.
That‚Äôs horrible. What country? If you don‚Äôt mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.
I guess if you haven't been on the sub for a while you don't understand that boycott was synonymous with incels and the alt-right
Its that classic rare games bring everyone together
I learned a lot from helping my dad work on his car, namely how to stand very still and quiet while someone loses their shit over something.
Why did you get it in the first place?
in a free society you'd never know if a woman had an abortion, so there's that.
They added it back for a short time but removed it shortly after.
Glad to see you were able to get this worked out, thx for the update! 
I needed this in my life
Which one is your favorite?
[NAME] is also in a HEAP of financial and technically legal trouble right now. lol
I think the real incels are the ones that were willing to buy her yoga pants, most likely her followers.
The weirdest part is the underwear. My mom wouldn‚Äôt even let me and my sister share underwear. Something something hygiene.
Here come the Doterra Boss Babes to the rescue!
Would be fun if our sun was like this :3
Online gaming is toxic. If those cuts were ever tapped, there would be lots of people in jail.
I... don‚Äòt see anything wrong with that?
anyone is allowed to talk to a therapist, and get counselling. that was never the issue
My aunt can also be very intimidating when she needs to be. It's her super power.
Wow this is amazing. LOVE THIS!!!
He kinda looks like [NAME]
True! Remember the geocentric universe? Oh man, they even put [NAME] in jail. What a hoot!
Once you pop, you can‚Äôt stop Wait a minute...
I'd be down with the big baller himself.
>I don‚Äôt believe in changing the rules and laws however ... Then you believe [RELIGION] is in the 7th century for all times
If that‚Äôs the case then these shows really are all about messing up people‚Äôs health...
Yea! But I realize now I was referring to the wrong movie.
No you are providing more than enough evidence. Post histories do exist. Now fuck off.
"I mean... It also has Strength as a ""fantasy power""? I don't get this joke "
5 is absolutely average. 6 would be kinda cute but nothing special. Kinda annoys me that so many people rate 5 as being lowkey ugly lol
Yeah I dont know. :S
Make a move now. She is ready. The breaking up In her head started 6 months ago so you can go ahead now.
How the fuck is that not ticketable.
Are you ghosting?
Is lab meat already available or are you guys referring to vegan burgers?
Boner. I'd have the weirdest boner.
Nothing like stealing a comment from the lottery thread..
Says the guy not replying to any counter points lmao
That was actually Chicago. Cute as hell though
If you are a [NAME] and he is a real person, then changing his ethnicity should be an issue, right?
Does she not know how cups work?
thank god your not on the dev team
You're welcome! Happy New year!
Those vast differences don't get noticed by the public.

Ranger Pathfinder?
Wow. Very thorough explanation. Thanks!
We are becoming increasingly aware that there is a significant portion of western populations which simply refuse to believe facts as delivered to them by educated professionals.
I was afraid of that .
Given the situation I actually think it was the best possible outcome. A great success.
Lol I‚Äôd leave my work phone off and be like, nope didn‚Äôt see any calls lol
Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.
Its a funny joke but it's delivered horribly
It's a dumb and harmful thing, when you invite people because of their race and sexual orientation over qualifications and skill
The dog has a very confused look on his face lol.
I think it's racist to call yourself or anyone European. If you're born on Earth, you're an [NAME], separating yourself is Racist.
Hi, I'm not [NAME] but I do have a question. During the term of your education were you ever required to do any research?
"""Best prank ever"" :) One of my favorite moments."

Being lonely without him is far better than being lonely with him. Good line. I'm stealing that one!

That's two.
Sacrifice the individuals rights for the greater good of the community. That's the definition of fascism.

The FF/SDLP pact just kills off the SDLP in my eyes. No way can I vote for a party with links to the corrupt FF
Thank goodness for that!
I think they were planing to be tag team Rapists to a much younger you. I‚Äôm so glad you cancelled.
Thank you, this is genuinely helpful. 
I partly disagree. In an argument that stupid, whoever writes more text than the other person is inevitably the bigger moron.

Bioavailability is poor without an emulsifier, this is not a practical method of administration.
Wasn't he Eagles' top try scorer last year despite being a forward?
When dunking is your only offensive move you will be efficient. Hope he gets stronger and learns to not be in foul trouble.
I'm speechless.
Yeah I'm not arguing there isnt recreational potential though it can certainly mess you up. Doesn't help most products with dxm have other active ingredients.

"I like how even in her own post she shows the doctor just said ""what"" clearly not understanding her ramblings "
agree with the messaging but such a cringe video
I used to really like [NAME]. Now she is the worst :(
Baths, especially after the gym. Fresh flowers in the apt. Emotions are pretty cool too.
Do it :) You‚Äôd make my day!
Crazy he took 1 year contract instead of a stable 4 year contract. Kind of shows you how dumb the guy is, 1 injury is all it takes
Sorry, there was a little bitterness in my voice from how my father treated me. Not directed at OP. I am in the wrong. 
Game pass has a lot of good games you get aswell, id look at them first

if it's harassment its a criminal charge. I haven't read the decision yet but this seems like a stretch based on what i know.
It is pointless to work for under a dollar an hour, that doesn't even cover the cost of their transportation to and from work.
It doesn‚Äôt surprise me given that this is the kind of establishment where staff rape the coma patients.

No way, that was brilliant!
This is solid advice.
"As [NAME] says,""Just put your emotions over there and eventually you will die"""
Same reason the KKK, a radical [RELIGION] group, burns crosses.
I think this type of stuff is great fun too. However, my ex objects if the kids go back to her with too many scrapes and bruises.

My condolences. Lost my cat Zoey over a year ago. I still miss her like crazy. she was only 3 years old too.
Congratulations and by the way, you‚Äôre not fat, you are down to earth.
I was expecting ‚Äúlittle boys pants would always be ‚Äòhalf off‚Äô!‚Äù But that would be in r/unclejokes
I am in hysterics. How are these people so serious?
Idk why but I feel like this should be nsfw
Yes. Exactly. Anything non [NAME] belongs in the trash. Glad you agree.
That's no coincidence, factorio was inspired by modded Minecraft and iirc the first public post about the project was on the industrial craft forum
This is what we have for emergencies. It‚Äôs great and takes the 1 lbs canisters that are super cheap and easy to find.
The best part about reading brietbart articles is you know they won't give any facts to support their statement.
They‚Äôre not hated for their ethnicity. They‚Äôre hated for their actions&behavior.

Is it just me or does [NAME] drop his stick a lot more often than any other goalie?
I just came
I wish this was because he was being demoted and we were getting a new DC
No. If you want to make sure you play with people with mics, just put a post on LFG. Problem solved.
Right, ok thank you.
I heard rumors of this. From what I understand the plan is to set off nukes to get the core spinning again. Awesome Movie Reference BTW!
You look better when people can‚Äôt see you <3
So what happened is she tried to rape you
I agree 100%
I've just thrown all my spoons in the bin. I'll learn to eat yoghurt with a fork.
[NAME] book? What the heck?!
I always thought it was so it would sound like LGTV
You are actually an idiot. Not it is not a proven fact, it is a biased stereotype. It is definitely derogatory. 
I have all the names..
Stop with this revisionist history we literally just let him go because HE SUCKED
The fact that [NAME], the other principal in the original story, has gotten out of this unscathed is annoying.
Hi Mom I accidentally adopted 20 traumatized nerds. -Betty Darkness Dementia Raven Way

I‚Äôll miss you, [NAME] Today is a sad day for our high sock loving brethren [NAME]
That 0.75 is not for the same job. It's looking at the totality of female salary vs male salary.
Oooo too soon man
A lack of the romantic partner is the stressful situation in my life.
He lives in Russia. This is not the best thing to make public in that country.
THIS IS WHAT WE GET FOR RIPPING ON THE WILD ANIMAL SHITPOSTS
Great concept but, there is going to be a Danganrompa 4

Keep dreaming. He isn't coming to this black hole of an organization.
Im glad [NAME] was there for us
Well I don't think it works the other way around. As someone who is incredibly insecure, I am also definitely not a narcissist.
Maybe also therapy and medication.
In your logic, billions of people being less poor is somehow a bad thing.
Can‚Äôt wait to lose this one!
Glad to hear. Thanks for the support.

[NAME] fouled him. It's simple.
Because Reddit. The other day I got downvoted because I said I liked The Office lol
It feels weird reading a VICE article talking about itself in the third person.
Now there‚Äôs a thought...
I can answer this! It's alright. Interesting little snippets that make me curious about the show for sure.
And then get frustrated when they realize the internet isn't censored and then call for censorship.
Omg I just looked it up and all the places look so beautiful there üòç also I‚Äôm sorry that it‚Äôs homophobic

Removed due to being wtf question.
Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
Oh, also forgot to add, LOTION! ALWAYS lotion afterwards. It only makes your skin smoother!

The World Between Worlds veered worryingly close to this territory. Luckily it was handled well.
 Don't be so stupid. Terrorism is inherently political, religion is just one of the tools used to carry it out. 
I had the same thought, I didn‚Äôt see anything notable about this at all.
Can't believe [NAME] has been in the league that long...
Just grip it and rip it!
I am out, it is a beautiful day and the air is crisp and refreshing.
Hmm. My sister is halfway vegan and she loves oreos because they actually don't have any dairy in them.

Agree with most of above apart from TERA is no cash grab unlees you just want to fast forward a little with gear and it really is a little lol
I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
If [NAME] has similar role to end year then no way am I taking those over him ...especially Sony
I almost downvoted you, because ‚ÄúBoooooooo!‚Äù

I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!
But those other jobs are what allow the engine of US imperialism to keep running, and keep destroying innocent people's lives all around the world.

Just replace guys kissing with sexy [NAME]
Best pancakes in town!!
Honestly why even make it about her, I was fascinated by his dedication! 
just fed up of reading subjective opinions be paraded as fact that he was the worse ever.
I wondered what'd happen if I was away for too long from camp. So cool this happens
Your 'brother' had texted alot of girls and ended up on in Internet many times then, what a celebrity! Did everyone clap as well? 
Wow, I might actually watch this weirdo movie this time. 
I was surprised to see [NAME] towing the line on his show.
This team is fucking embarrassing.
Damn that sucks did you get a tip at least?
THAT FEELING WHEN YOU DISCOVER THE GOP CAN'T MEME
Yeah it's pretty odd how defensive some people are about my comment too
Well, I'm glad you're out of all that now. How awful. The way they act, they make you think healthy boundaries are you being hostile.
[NAME] what a piece of shit! How could you do that to an animal?!
Omg I know. She honestly looks so uncomfortable. There HAS to be someone better who could host?!
I bought the double barrel and fully upgraded it and now it's one of my favorite guns.
At least my suffering is over.

WWF/WWE had/has been on TV in the UK since the early 80s. And we certainly like a drop of beer. We don't tend to have disposal tables so much
Wouldn't it just be enough to be really interesting is to go through the arguments. However, I would guess this is the most symmetric of these.
I had no idea this was a thing gas pumps could do. I've only ever seen ones you have to physically hold. This is mind blowing!

I actually like the progression of the [NAME] story. I think he has a chance to have a fantastic arc between FC5 and New Dawn.
Go ask that at /r/drama. People there might have all the links and screencaps still.
I had a feeling...crazy what that guy can do to his body.
Nope, my current response is that both the means and the ends are independently justified on their own accords.
It's brainwashing. When you have people keep pleasuring themselves, they're easier to manipulate. 
The middle was an analogy. No one here condones terrorism, as that's attacks on civilians, Destruction of financial buildings isn't that. 
Wow, ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù Democrats betraying the revolution. Who would had guessed?
Nope, not me. I am primarily a cyclist and drive as little as possible.

I‚Äôm curious as to how this came about in badwomensanatomy. Was she saying this was something that couldn‚Äôt be done?
Idk you seem pretty miserable and really bitter and angry. It must be exhausting and I hope you find happiness some day.
