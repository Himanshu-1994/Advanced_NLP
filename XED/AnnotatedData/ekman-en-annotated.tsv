Are you vulnerable to him in any way ?	1,2
As a so called one percenter motorcycle club , [PERSON] are notoriously violent .	1,2
As I step into the rat catcher , the first thing I notice , besides the smell of rancid beer and stale piss , is the tension .	1
As if he isn't going to be hurt enough , she has to twist a knife in him too .	1
As it happens , you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it .	1
As you say , a foolish article .	1
At bottom she's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in .	1
At my age , corrected by an illiterate .	1
At the moment , no .	1
At this rate , we'll have to head home inside hours .	1
Aw , [PERSON] , now what ?	1
Away from all the words , the monuments , the whole rotten show .	1
Awkward ass .	1
Bad dog !	1
Bastards !	1
Bear in mind she's a foreigner , so prepare for hysterics , even a fainting spell .	1
Because I do not like my mother .	1
Because of this attempted prison break , [PERSON] would have to serve additional time .	1,5,6
Because we are food for worms , lads .	1
Because we need to look just like them if we want to pass unnoticed .	1,2
Because you like power .	1
Because you talked me into this , that's why , you idiot !	1
Before proceeding further , I'll remind the visitors in the gallery that they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such .	1
Besides , I really do repent . Really .	1
Better have something to give me this time , officer .	1
Better you than your mother .	1
Bitch .	1
Black powder and worse ...	1
Bodies strung out , bodies with the skins ripped off , the hearts torn from the cadavers .	1,5
[PERSON] was my prisoner .	1,5
[PERSON] , listen to him .	1,2,5
Both those guys on the trailer are in it .	1,2
Bought in to fool people into thinking they were aliens , yeah .	1
Boys , sweep them out of the gutter .	1
[PERSON] , you don't like this job any more than I do , do you ?	1
Burn them all away .	1
But a little more of your stupid behavior and even the respectability of my house won't shield you .	1
But for now , there is sufficient cowardice , sloth and mendacity down there on Earth to last forever .	1
But he became such a damn pest that I left [LOCATION] .	1
But he's talking about the illegal part of it .	1
But I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all .	1
But I had locked the briefcase of the [PERSON] in the morning following to her death .	1
But I told you never to fight a street fighter fight .	1,5
But if [PERSON]'s an angel , why ain't he in Heaven ?	1,2,5,6
But if we work hard together and if fortune smiles on us , we'll be able to make you into a human being .	1
But the gun shoots death and purifies the earth of the filth of brutals .	1
But the hair is rotten here .	1
But then you have to live with it .	1,5
But when I'm lining up a deal , I don't want any dancehall woman listening in !	1
But you haven't had much respect for them .	1
But you needn't go on account of this idiot .	1
But you're lying .	1
But your love does not match your lust for power .	1
But , God , people can be rude .	1
But , I , after spending years I found not a shred of evidence that we have alien visitors in our skies .	1
But , in a democracy , we do not shoot unarmed suspects on sight for a murder in which their participation is still unproven .	1
But , [PERSON] , he dresses like the man that cremated Uncle [PERSON] .	1
But , of course , she's lying .	1
by getting blackout drunk .	1
By making a lot of idiotic loans ?	1
By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	1
Can you imagine her traveling around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank ?	1
Can't pay his bills .	1
Careful now , I have feelings like a real human being .	1
[PERSON] , this is intolerable !	1
Certainly making a fool of yourself .	1
Champion of dumb animals , ladies in distress , lost kids and lost causes .	1
[PERSON] , she tore the fuckin' place apart .	1
Christ . What a dump .	1
[PERSON] , I can't make it so soon ...	1,5
Coco sounds like she caught the old man cheating again .	1

Come on ! No , no , I don't want to go to the women's gymnasium .	1,2,5
Come on ! What's it mean , anyway ?	1
Come on ...	1
Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan .	1
Contempt for the law , that's what you've got .	1
Cos whatever you got up there , I'm gonna find it out .	1
Course they gave him a big hunk of money for a settlement . Don't nobody know how much it was .	1
Cowards !	1
Crazy out of your skull .	1
Creeps .	1

Did he in you ?	1
Did you come to see me for the same reason as the man with sweat on his face ?	1
Did you spend every cent you ever made ?	1
Disappear .	1
Disgusting .	1
Do I have to bother with that shit ?	1
Do some more rolling and tossing and thinking about it .	1
Do something please !	1,2
Do we have to sit with them ?	1,2
Do what ?	1,6
Do you always lie ?	1
Do you know what they say about girls who play ?	1
Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals ?	1
Do you think we'd better let it go at that ?	1
Do your friends put money in your pocket , [PERSON] ?	1
Does the clown work for [PERSON] too ?	1
Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you ?	1
Don't be a fool , woman .	1
Don't be a fool .	1
Don't be so impolite in the future	1
Don't come back here  - that's a bit like saying :  Do not read this note  . 	1
Don't do anything foolish .	1
Don't even , no . Don't look at me !	1
Don't ever try to come in between , you smart - eyed slob .	1
Don't get too used to those long lunches .	1
Don't give me all that sally army stuff .	1
Don't I know you from somewhere ?	1
Don't lie to me , you pepper gut .	1
Don't mind my saying so , but why don't you do something about your hair ?	1
Don't talk rot , [PERSON] .	1
Don't touch me unless you love me .	1
Don't touch me !	1
Don't you call my husband ...	1
Don't you consider this a public responsibility to respond now ?	1,6
Don't you find that kind of disturbing ?	1,2
Don't you have any principles ?	1
Don't you have any respect for yourself ?	1
Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children stolen ?	1
[PERSON] , you of all people should understand by now that to me , they're the same thing .	1
Dopehead mothers . Garbage blood .	1
Dressing is common courtesy , [PERSON] .	1
Easterner speaks with forked tongue .	1
Eighteen years on the force , six on Narcotics , four on Safe and Loft and the guy's never fired a gun .	1,5,6
Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman .	1
Enough to spread you out like a crazy woman's quilt .	1
Er , you were arrested for being carried by a motor vehicle taken without consent , and resisting arrest .	1
Erm ... I was just coming to that .	1
Escort him out of the building .	1
Essex , when will you realize how vital it is not to make enemies at court ?	1
Even before [PERSON] you refuse to reveal your true appearance !	1
Even if this room gets filled with lies like these and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place .	1
Even so drunk , your brain is the greatest this side the [LOCATION] .	1
even though it continues to dominate the market for sex ads .	1
Ever since they lost our luggage you have been sourcastic with me , and irritable , and insensitive and intolerant !	1

For being the biggest dickhead I ever went out with .	1
For far too long .	1
For four years , and now it's over . For four years , I've invited the guests and bought the favors and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests .	1,5
For the hospital , for the seriously sick .	1
For three months , we've been listening to that sad sack spout his unhinged tirades , day in and day out , because we were promised % of the ransom .	1
For you to become a murderer ?	1,5,6
Found hair in your comb .	1

Act natural .	2
Admiral know what that is ?	2,6
After this , I doubt we shall be allowed to live at all .	2
Ain't no way in the world I'm goin' up that path .	2
[PERSON] , I am in danger .	2
All guns to fire at the turn .	2
All I ask of you is be careful .	2
All I could think of was that they were going to kill me .	2
All killed ?	2
All right , for those people on the street , if there's any trouble , collapse on the house . Those inside , stay inside .	2,6
All right , I'll tell him .	2

Almighty Sir ... do not drop us in the claws of the eternal death ...	2
Am I a criminal for that ?	2
Am I really good enough ?	2
Am I sure ?	2,6
An enemy had saved my life by the violent murder of one of my best friends .	2
And as I was relating this to him , our missiles started shutting down one by one .	2
And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife .	2,6
And her blood is a deadly venom .	2
And I felt real scared , [LOCATION] .	2
And I haven't seen her since .	2,5
And I panicked , and I lied .	2,5
And I was thinking ' Why haven't they arrested us ? ' 	2,6
And if he doesn't get it , he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900 , men out of work .	2
And it starts creating the specter of a threat .	2
And [PERSON] was trying to kill him .	2
And lock your doors while you're driving , Because there is no telling what kind of hustlers Can come up to your car .	2
And now the kidnappers are playing them against each other , trying to get the $ million .	2
And now we need a law enforcement unit able to meet the enemy on his own ground and carrying enough firepower to get the job done .	2
And now your grandmother is here and the ceremony starts at noon .	2,5
And nowhere is more dangerous than their local bar , the rat catcher .	2
And that scares the shit out of me , kid .	2
And that's another reason why you don't speak about it .	2
And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	2
And that's the way it was .	2
And the island is surrounded by warships .	2
And the more dangerous you are , the shorter the options on your future .	2

Any trouble , call on the phone .	2
Anybody could be wrong .	2
Anyone in your vicinity is in danger .	2
Anything serious ?	2

Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what .	2,6

Around about midnight , the ghosts and banshees get together for nightly jamborees .	2
As bad as it was having her missing , it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your - year - old child .	2,5
As long as they're not dead ...	2
Ask him how we'll get outta here .	2
Asses burnt to a cinder .	2
At night the executioner can't tell one from another	2

Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution ...	2

But he knew I was lying .	2
But how will your father feel if he never sees you again ?	2
But I can't volunteer anything .	2,5,6
But I got ta warn you , she can be a little vicious with the garlic !	2
But I'm not out of danger yet .	2
But I'm not sure anything else makes sense right now .	2
But if I don't hear from you in a week , me and [PERSON] are going to disappear .	2
But in fact the level was dangerously low .	2
But it can't be a date  date . 	2
But it's bleeding ?	2
But it's nothing I wanted my daughter or anybody down at the Bureau to make a big deal about , either .	2,5
But it's now the military industrial intelligence complex that are moving bureaucratically towards establishing dominion and control over the entire democratic process in the country .	2
But it's our necks you're risking now , and I say no .	2
But my problem is , there's a terrible crime committed today and I haven't told the police .	2
But people just respected him , respected his , uh ...	2
But the crisis is now , sir .	2
But the neighbours will know we've adopted .	2,6
But the rescue has to happen immediately .	2
But the water was dangerously low ?	2
But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator .	2
But then , uh ... . You look to me like a gal with a big appetite for everything .	2
But there is a great deal of evidence that they are concerned with our hostility .	2,6
But there's something you may not know about us .	2
But there's the challenge .	2
But they turned the lights down this time and didn't say this is a drill .	2
But they'll accuse you of helping me escape	2,6
But they're all dead .	2
But this is a family emergency , we do need you at home ,	2
But to speak of this , to anyone , would bring dire consequences .	2,5
But until we figure it out , it may be a good idea for you to stay at home .	2
But what happens if ...	2
But what's that thing in my back pocket .	2
But when men who aren't actually there have intercourse with you , it is time to see a good psychiatrist .	2
But you said it was safe .	2
But , Mr. [PERSON] , what about ... ?	2
But , sir , when the job's done , who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did ?	2
But , what if it doesn't work ?	2
But , you see , if this thing here controls you , it's gonna burn you and everythin' else around you up . That's right .	2
By the destruction of any nuclear weapons sent into space .	2
By the way ...	2

A captain's job is a lonely one .	5
A command is a lonely job . It isn't easy to make decisions .	5
A depressing characteristic .	5
A desecration of what used to be the finest .	5,6

About [PERSON] , you told me that your husband [PERSON] deserted you .	5
About [LOCATION] , I don't think this is really the best time .	5
Acknowledging defeat is never easy .	5
Afraid not . dollars , please .	5
After all she done ?	5,6
After all , I had caused the girl considerable discomfort .	5
After that , things kind of went downhill .	5,6
Ah , yes ! ' I had a migraine , your Majesty .	5,6
Ah , you should have stuffed her in the car with the friend .	5,6
All I ever do is try to make you happy .	5
All I ever do is try to please you	5
All I got is what you see here .	5
All I heard was trash talk .	5
All I wan na do is clean it up , get it right .	5
All I'm askin' for is a chance .	5
All I've got are a lot of bad habits and a lot of bad debts .	5
All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	5
All my powers have gone .	5
All that bread and livin' in a dump like this . Smashed cars , busted - out buses ... but all good stashes .	5
All that fighting in there wore me out .	5
All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that .	5
All the poor young girls .	5
All those mothers had to make do with what nature gave them .	5
Almost .	5
Am I so strange to you ?	5
An acquaintance of mine stole classified documents from the NSA and took off to [LOCATION] .	5
An animal had gnawed off its own foot to escape from a trap .	5
And denied .	5
And for that , I can never forgive myself .	5
And he was so sorry for locking me up .	5
And he will be missed .	5
And I cried the whole time .	5
And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus .	5
And I don't want to ....	5
And I'm thinking that , well ... maybe the mill's taking you away from me and [PERSON] .	5
And I'm tweaking . I'm outta money .	5
And I've loved something that doesn't really exist .	5
And in a fit of anger , I told her that our being together , our rekindled romance , was a big mistake .	5
And isaac started flying up To the sad broken star .	5
And just what exactly are your intentions , young man ?	5,6
And no one will believe me .	5
And she got in a car accident .	5
And so I turned away my head and wept .	5
And Spider Man died kind of slow .	5
And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment , which we do not and which we will prove .	5,6
And that's all I can give you .	5
And then came the war .	5
And then I - I don't know what happened .	5
And then this morning - I lost 'em . - We lost them .	5,6
And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown .	5
And then , of course , there was the unexpected and , I must say , regrettable suicide of [PERSON] .	5
And they're having more fun .	5
And to my surprise to my deep surprise , it's harder to say goodbye than I thought .	5
And we didn't know how to help her deal with it .	5
And what most people don't see ... is just how hard it is to do the right thing .	5
And you've been resenting me .	5
Another funeral for the pilot , not as spiffy as [PERSON]'s .	5
Any more than I could on that night I saw [PERSON] for the last time .	5
Anyway the orders promoting him to Detective , First Grade , have already been cut .	5
Anyway you can't go to the hospital .	5,6
Anyways , no good no more , Kid .	5
Are you all alone in there ?	5
Are you crying ?	5
Arguing's pretty much in my blood .	5
As for me , I'm just a slave .	5
As it is , this is not the life I want for our children , for myself and for you .	5
As long as there was [PERSON] , there was a chance we might be happy .	5
As long as you're here , let me show you the books ... so you can see how bad a businessman I am .	5
At my age , you got ta think about retiring .	5
[PERSON] was worried too . 	5
Aw . What happened ?	5,6
Bad for you , worse for me .	5
Barney , I am sorry .	5
Because I am certain that in his thoughts he is completely alone .	5
Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ?	5
Because it was my misery .	5
Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime .	5
Because when you talked about murder on the tapes ... I assumed it was just hallucination .	5
Been dead over hours .	5
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough ...	5
Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ?	5
Behind this eloquent exterior , I've got a yellow streak miles wide .	5
Being real is a joke in your world ?	5
[LOCATION] laughed at my theory .	5
Besides , this desert climate's not too good on a girl's complexion .	5
big town ? I beg your pardon ?	5,6
Birth of some issues right there .	5,6
Bless me , Father , for I have sinned .	5
Bloomy , were you asleep ?	5
[PERSON] is dead .	5
Boy , am I tired !	5
Boys forget what their country means by just reading  Land of the Free  in history books .	5
Breaking my heart with your impossible love !	5
But don't look so gloomy .	5
But even so , it is quite awful when nobody in loves , is not ?	5
But he's an angry guy . Picks up something , kills her .	5
But he's dead .	5
But I am guilty .	5
But I can't play them with you .	5
But I don't care about any of that now .	5
But I paid a heavy price .	5
But I shouldn't have left like that . I'm sorry .	5
But I thought we were gonna be partners .	5
But I want to be alone .	5
But I was crying because I. ...	5
But I will not attempt one here and now .	5,6
But I'm gonna miss you , baby .	5
But I'm missin' it , man .	5
But in that case , We are no more guilty than the rest of the world .	5
But it was that that looked .	5,6
But it's sad .	5
But [LOCATION]'s a horrid place .	5
But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you .	5
But now , I don't suppose I shall ever see it again .	5
But problems don't just go , [PERSON] , you know ?	5
But really , was there any choice ?	5
But [PERSON] is gone .	5
But that is not true .	5
But that's another story , and a very unpleasant one , too .	5
But the man I'm in love with doesn't .	5
But the war had changed him .	5
But there's an insurance log that monitors how much money is in the bank at any given time .	5
But there's nothing for me to do after 3:00 .	5
But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	5,6
But when I told the police , I do not think they believed me .	5
But when the sick one is yourself , you can not run away .	5
But when you worry , darkness does something to you .	5
But you can't .	5
But you can not help her .	5
But you had to wait till now , now when [PERSON]'s dying ... to show me that I could never mean any more to you ... than this Watling woman does to [PERSON] .	5
But you have to make a change to your life , put in some effort .	5,6
But you look like you're more upset than that .	5
But you seem to go to [LOCATION] rather more than you come to [LOCATION] .	5,6
But you were never there for me , Dad .	5
But you would have gone ...	5
But you'll never find another [PERSON] .	5
But you're not enjoying yourself .	5
But , you see , it's really his wife that's keeping them apart .	5
But . .	5,6
But ...	5
By having all the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly .	5
By the way , [PERSON] , about your car ...	5
Bye .	5
Can not afford a dowry to each of his daughters .	5
Can we ever believe again ?	5
Can you , can you , can you , meet me , please .	5
Can -- I was gonna ask you if I could give it to you ?	5
Can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them ?	5
Can't be done , not with this equipment .	5
Can't he stay ? Tomorrow's not a school day .	5
Can't watch it .	5
Can't you see how upset I am about my poor uncle's death ?	5
Captain , was [PERSON] wasted ?	5
[PERSON] hits the ceiling and throws me out .	5
[PERSON] would've fought back .	5,6
Casualty report ?	5
Catholic school . A little minor league ball , long enough to find out I couldn't hit a curve .	5
Certain camps where the men aren't paid enough or fed enough or protected against disease enough .	5,6
Charlie , have you thought how horrible it must have been ?	5
Child , crying :	5
Children , I have bad news for you .	5
Clearly , we didn't trust each other with them .	5
Climbing on a heap of black and metal sheets and pilings ...  ... he hardly recognized the once proud and famous [LOCATION] .  	5
College degree , lovable personality ... and I spend most of my time in prison .	5
Come on , lighten up .	5
Come on , man .	5,6
Completely out of our hands . - I don't accept that . - It's out of your hands .	5
Comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in [LOCATION] .	5
Cos I think that people die sometimes when they don't wan na live no more .	5
Could we just go over one or two more ...	5
Daddy , I want Mommy !	5
Daddy , there are balloons floating away .	5
Daisy's leaving you .	5
Dear Mr. [PERSON] .   This is about a deputy prosecuting attorney who is taking bribes .  	5,6
[PERSON] , your mother and I have brought you to this spot to share this last private ... This moment of ... Grief and pain .	5
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle .	5
Death was from suffocation .	5
[PERSON] will never stand for it .	5
Did I say something wrong ?	5
Did you have a warrant ?	5
Disappointing .	5,6
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to could be so weak .	5
Do not .	5,6
Do you have a boyfriend ?	5,6
Do you know how many people are dying ?	5,6
Do you think nobody can tell ?	5
Do you want to know everything ?	5
Doc , I don't want to fly any more .	5
Doctor , can a sane man possibly perform offensive or foolish acts ?	5
Does this mean you don't like me anymore ?	5
[PERSON] tried to straighten her out .	5
Don't bother about me .	5
Don't cry , honey .	5
Don't cry .	5
Don't drink alone .	5
Don't forget me , [PERSON] .	5
Don't give us hunches .	5,6
Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now .	5
Don't leave without saying goodbye .	5
Don't look so depressed .	5
Don't make me feel like this .	5
Don't you think she's paid her dues ?	5
Don't you want me with you ?	5
During the night , I was woken by [PERSON] crying .	5
[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	5
[PERSON] was killed .	5
[PERSON] , how long has it been since I said I love you ?	5
[PERSON] drowned the day before his fourth birthday .	5
Especially when there are no days and nights in it , but just days that turn black when the sun goes down .	5
Even though we have each other . It can be a very lonely existence .	5
Even when we rehearsed it , I felt something sad and tender .	5
Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you .	5
Every time I think about it , I get sad and depressed , and I'm having flashbacks .	5
Everybody except me .	5
Everybody's mother's got to die sometime .	5
Everybody's waiting .	5
Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship .	5
Everyone sees this thing except me .	5
Everyone was in mourning .	5
Everything is cold and finished .	5
Everything is part of the great lie .	5
Faced with that ... regardless of my personal feelings for the boy , my sense of duty told me that his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer .	5
Fail !	5,6
Fantasia will be forgotten .	5
Fate and too many painkillers .	5
Father [PERSON] told me that you had to keep your hands to yourself .	5,6
Father , I'm at the end of my rope .	5
Feel better ?	5
[PERSON] , I have the most terrible news for you .	5
Fifty of them froze to death in one night .	5
Fine , fine . Say , [PERSON] , something kind of important has come up ...	5
First [PERSON] , now [PERSON] .	5
Five Wounds , for short .	5
[LOCATION] is not gonna have a baby .	5
For an hour . An hour ?	5,6
For me , the fun went out of it after [PERSON] died . It was never any good , really , after that .	5
For these and all my sins of my past life , I am heartily sorry .	5
For us , business is lousy .	5
Forget me .	5
Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	5
Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned .	5
Forgive me .	5
Forgive me ...	5
From then on I was hopelessly lost .	5
From top to bottom we are riddled with cruelty .	5
Fuckin' wearin' me out .	5
Gentlemen , it is difficult to admit to an error .	5
[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	5
[PERSON] , there's no point in going on .	5
Get rid of your gum .	5,6
[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	5
God , forgive me .	5
Gone .	5
gonna be some hard times coming down .	5
Good - bye , [PERSON] .	5
Goodbye , boys .	5
Goodbye , [PERSON] .	5
Goodbye , Mom .	5
Grandfather , I think it's a good day to die .	5
[PERSON] , she's dead .	5
Hans waved me off .	0,5

He ain't gonna make it .	2,5
He also does not support me .	2,5
He can't be your friend .	5,6
He can't get a clear shot !	5,6

He don't care about you and he don't care about me neither .	5
He got a little sick .	5
He got run over by a car .	5
He had to go back to work .	5
He had to say goodbye to one of us and that's too bad .	5
He killed when he was born ... without knowin' it .	2,5
He let go of my hand . And I was lost .	2,5
He leveraged himself up to his eyeballs . The investments didn't work out ... He got himself in serious debt .	1,5
He looks terrible .	5
He lost all his patients , he didn't wan na go to the office .	5
He must be going out of his mind .	5
He must have killed a man .	2,5
He never wanted me .	5
He probably doesn't remember me .	5
He said he forgot .	5,6
He said no pilots .	5,6
He said : Just leave the money in the top drawer .  	5
He shot himself .	1,2,5
He should be here with his family .	5
He shouldn't be a cop .	5,6
He shouldn't have to decide here .	5
He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope ... and gives the slow death of slavery .	5
He talks about the great lie  . 	5
He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times , and how , on the night of the murder , she not only smashed his radio but hit him .	0,1,2,5
He thinks it's a wonderful evening and then she takes a handful of pills and overdoses .	0,5
He told me they're getting cold feet .	0,1,5
He tried to remember that power he used to have over women back in his dangerous days .	5
He used to use his hands .	5
He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at .	5,6
He was gonna die ?	2,5,6
He was my brother .	5
He was [PERSON]'s beau , and he loved her , not me .	5
He wasn't much good , though .	5
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	1,5
He wouldn't have , unless he were discouraged and angry .	5
He'd undergone a lot of strain .	5
He'll never get started .	5
He's a little bit grumpy right now .	5
He's a poor boy .	5
He's a real choirboy .	5
He's after me .	2,5
He's all tired out , though , the poor little guy .	5
He's capable of giving this administration an enormous amount of grief .	0,1,5
He's dead and buried , [PERSON] .	5
He's dead , isn't he ?	2,5
He's dying .	5
He's getting farther away every second .	5

He's in plenty of hot water .	5
He's in trouble . Boy ?	5

He's the town joke , and I'm stuck with him .	0,5

Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me , in my present reduced circumstances .	0,1,5
Here on holiday but seems to be having a bit of car trouble ?	3,5,6
Here , at least , I'm a little star .	5
Hey , come on .	3,5,6
Hey , please , just hear me .	5
Hey , wasn't it gruesome , that girl who was shot in the street today ?	5
Hey , you told me the only way you survive is because you're a team .	0,1,5
Hey ! So I know I haven't been the best dad in the world .	5
Hi , [PERSON] . I'm sorry I didn't get to send you a card yet about your wife .	5
Hi , maria . - ( sighs )	5
Hi ! Hi Princess ! This isn't really the best time right now .	3,5
Hi . Come on , dad , let's play ! Come on , dad , please , let's play .	3,5
His life means nothing .	1,5
His name was [PERSON] .	5
Honestly ...	5
Honey , I haven't had a chance to really talk to her ...	5
How awful .	5
How can I make you believe me ?	5
How can I take time when I know what's going on ?	5
How can I ?	5
How can we be sure she'll help us free the Childlike Empress ?	5
How can you be so cruel and unfeeling ?	5
How can you be so mean ?	1,5
How can you forget yourselves this way ?	5
How can you think that I could do a thing like that ?	1,5,6
How could he say a thing like that ?	0,1,5,6
How could I have forgotten about [PERSON] ?	5
How could you speak of love to me , say the things you did , and you about to be married .	5
How dare you , you ... How long has she been in this condition ?	0,1,2,5,6
How did we end up talking about your death from my drug test ? I don't understand .	5
How did you find me ?	5,6
How do you know what I want ?	5,6
How do you mean that ? And now you will laugh .	5,6
100 % truthful , Ace ? - Yeah .	6
% ? !	6
$ , for a taxi !	6
A beautiful woman like you ?	6
A bus ?	6
A cook ?	6
A few years ago , you was a truck driver .	6
A good thing my reactions are so fast	6
A good - looking girl like you ?	6
A heroic thought , Barley .	6
A horse - ranch Indian , a drunken gunfighter , a sex maniac ... and an uncle !	6
A hundred thousand dollars ?	6
A quarter of a million dollars ?	6
A rather odd reaction .	6
A Webley automatic ...	6
About what happened . When ?	6
Abracadabra !	6
Acid ?	6
[PERSON] ? - Yeah !	6
Actually , we don't know a soul here .	6
[PERSON] , what's happenin' here ?	6
Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	6
Ah , the ring !	6
Ah , was from there .	6
Ah . You believed in it and you fought for it .	6
Ah ... I see it pays to advertise on television .	6
Ain't she seen a man before ?	6
Ain't that the girl [PERSON] went lookin' for ?	6
[PERSON] , you got here fast .	6
[PERSON] , don't you remember ?	6
[PERSON] , you remind me of someone I used to know .	6
[PERSON] , do you know what you're saying ?	6
All ?	6
All of a sudden , there's a lot of noise .	6
All of them ?	6
All of you !	6
All that gossip !	6
All that money , [PERSON] ?	6
Allow me to get that bag for you .	6
Am I interrupting something ?	6
An engineer ?	6
An odd coincidence , both of you turning up here .	6
And did you believe this nonsense ?	6
And everybody say hello to kit - [PERSON] !	6
And he who spies and flies away lives to spy another day .	6
And he wouldn't let you help him ?	6
And I got so drunk I puked spaghetti everywhere .	6
And I really didn't think you wanted to be looped in on my schedule .	6
And I was thinking more of sushi ?	6
And I was with some boys in the neighborhood , and we saw this and went ,  Oh , My God ! 	6
And if I kissed it ... and made a wish ... it'd come true .	6
And just how did he go about that ?	6
And [PERSON]'s sent you about a ton of tea . Well , a couple of pounds .	6
And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	6
And people do the strangest things , too .	6
And so I clicked it and ... There was the pictures of my daughter .	6
And the kid you're taking off ... you give him , .	6
And they told me that you weren't that smart .	6
And were you not told the same thing by his wife ?	6
And what do you think those old geezers really miss in [LOCATION] ?	6
And what happens Tuesday ?	6
And you believe that ?	6
And you found out ?	6
And you know what ? They offered us a job .	6
And you shouldn't neglect your gums .	6
And you were right there !	6
And you're it .	6
Any guy who says he can fence $ 50,000 , is crazy .	6
Anyone'd think you didn't want to get better .	6
Apparently [PERSON] smells like [LOCATION] too .	6
Are they all hollow shells ? !	6
Are they both mad ?	6
Are we here at the mechanic ?	6
Are we killers now ?	6
Are you abandoning the search ?	6
Are you coming with me ?	6
Are you crazy , [PERSON] ?	6
Are you guys brothers !	6
Are you hurt bad , mate ?	6

Isn't [PERSON]'s death enough ?	2
Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk ?	2
Isn't that terrible !	2
Isn't the reverse possible ?	2
It ain't safe to go that way ...	2
It all began one night when the lights went out. ,	2
It can only blow up in our faces .	2

It may endanger the very peace and stability of [LOCATION] .	2
It means , um ... if you say anything about this , - your ass is grass . - Okay .	0,2
It might get infected .	2
It must be serious .	2
It put the rope to the neck !	0,2

It's a big mistake .	2
It's a cruel disease .	2
It's a damn nightmare .	2
It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners .	0,2
It's a matter of life and death !	0,2
It's a matter of life and death .	2
It's a monster !	2
It's a passion that continues to grow , ... The more the King is drowning .	2
It's a shark !	2
It's a train robbery .	2
It's a trap .	2
It's a wonder we make a profit at all .	2
It's all been like a crazy nightmare .	2
It's all coming apart , Al.	2,5
It's all right , don't shoot !	2
It's already on the : news .	2
It's awfully quaint , isn't it ?	2
It's bad there .	2
It's bad .	2
It's black smoke .	2
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country .	2
It's dangerous .	2
It's difficult holding her .	2
It's going to be a disaster .	2,5
It's gonna be a massacre .	2
It's gonna be a treacherous hike .	2
It's gonna take some getting used to , isn't it ?	2
It's her !	2,3,6
It's horrible .	2
It's just that ... the breeding is no longer working .	2
It's just when you say these things are closing in on me , it's like a nightmare .	2
It's just -- it's hard sometimes .	2,5
It's kind of the hardest part of all these 'cause he doesn't -- He don't know why we're here .	2
It's like that time in [LOCATION] when he made me walk ... stripped down to only my long - handles and my hat .	2
It's like they're after me , right ?	2
It's looking for us .	2
It's not an easy thing to do .	2,5
It's not enough .	2,5
It's not going to be a problem , is it , [PERSON] ?	2
It's not going to be easy .	2
It's not like that .	2
It's not mine , man .	2
It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out .	2
It's not safe .	2
It's not what you think . I - I - I would never ... Please , [PERSON] .	2,5
It's only temporary , you know ?	2
It's serious trouble . So many dead and wounded .	2,5
It's something I couldn't discuss with anyone .	2
It's three years since my last confession .	2
It's ticking like a bomb .	2
It's too dangerous , it's utterly unpredictable .	2
It's too late to start anything now .	2
It's too late , isn't it ?	2
It's too late .	2
It's too risky .	2
It's too young for a heart attack .	2
It's urgent !	2
It's you .	2
It's your gun , sir ?	2
[PERSON] , I warn you .	2
[PERSON] could be killed .	2,6

I'm still in my office , I'll wait for you .	3
I'm strong , snappy , loving .	3
I'm sure glad we've run into you .	3
I'm sure I can do it .	3
I'm sure that in all [LOCATION] there's no empathicalist as charming as you .	3
I'm sure that's thanks to you as well .	3
I'm sure you'll be glad to know that law and order has come to [LOCATION] .	3
I'm taking a bath .	3
I'm taking over the bridge .	3
I'm telling you , it's gonna be all right .	3
I'm the funny one .	3
I'm thinking about my own ass .	3
I'm thinking about showing him and getting pregnant . Of course if I get pregnant I can't go to FATI .	3
I'm very fond of my wife and kid .	3
I'm very happy to know you , sir .	3
I'm very pleased to meet you , sister [PERSON] .	3
I'm willing to keep the conversation going , - but in the meantime ...	3
I'm with you .	3
I'm worth the risk , you'll see .	3
I've a great program to try out .	3
I've always admired the way he went into the snow for his mates .	3
I've always been in love with you .	3
I've been building a reputation for years .	3
I've been building a reputation for 25 , years .	3
I've been missing you a lot lately .	3,5
I've been sleeping with women .	3
I've come to get you - it's my party .	3
I've escaped !	3
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels .	3
I've got a plan .	3
I've got cookies !	3
I've got some good wine .	3
I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	3
I've got something down here .	3
I've got tons of exotic destinations , faraway places , custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway .	3
I've got you the assignment of your dreams !	3
I've had a lot of fun , [PERSON] , I saw some shows , went to nightclubs .	3
I've had enough , thanks .	3
I've looked all over for shoes like that .	3,6
I've never been happier in my life .	3
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	3
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are .	3
I've told you that he is what other men are not .	3
If [PERSON]'s a good boy , he gets the jackpot .	3
If he likes running his fingers through my hair , well , why not ?	3
If he made it , so can I !	3
If I see you in the stands , it make me feel better .	3
If I use my last wish ...	3
If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that .	3
If it's so beautiful down there , why ...	3
If there was a bum within miles , I was completely attracted to him .	1,3,5
If we can force them to come in and face us , we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape .	1,3
If you did your cheekbones better , you could look like [PERSON] .	3
If you didn't try new things , there'd be no progress .	3,6
If you need to take a break , you can .	3
If you start to hesitate , call me .	3
If you worked for the imperial court your future would be boundless	3
If your mother were alive , she'd be so happy .	3
In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club .	3
In case I want to read it more than once .	3
In fact , I admire the style of you .	3
In fact , I'm just about to haul nuggies .	3
In my dreams I saw a light over [LOCATION] and I knew there was hope .	3
In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless , graceful harmony .	3
In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit .	3
In the final analysis , all we're trying to do is create a happy world .	3
In the garden of a convent in [LOCATION] , there's a beautiful statue .	3
In the last two years of his life , he gave away most of his fortune ... in large , anonymous donations , to your charity .	3,6
In the summertime , at sunset , the whole beach looks incredible .	3
In this business , one should joke a little .	3
Is her lover . He comes over .	3,6
Is it not fortunate , for instance , that I own the newspapers in my country ?	3
Is it ... and look who's there !	3,6
Is that a fine - lookin' woman or what ?	3
Is this a beautiful castle ?	3
Isabelle !	3

Isn't that wonderful ?	3

Isn't this fun ?	3
Isn't this just fabulous ?	3
I'll never get this . We're doomed !	2,5
I'll never have a girl like that 	5
I'll never see you again .	5
I'll start weeping with self - pity any minute .	5
I'm a sex trafficking survivor .	3,5
I'm a sick man .	5
I'm a three - time loser , [PERSON] .	5
I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn .	5

I'm afraid I've disappointed you .	5
I'm afraid it's all my fault .	5
I'm afraid Scraps will have to be shot .	5
I'm afraid the press has been alerted to your mother's presence here ... - ... and her arrest . - Oh , great .	1,5
I'm afraid we lost our patient .	5
I'm afraid we must go , dear .	5
I'm an old man who will live until I die .	5

I'm falling ...	5
I'm flying under false colours , Miss [PERSON] .	1,5
I'm getting numb all over .	2,5,6
I'm going home . I - I'm not well .	2,5
I'm going now to the church for confession .	2,5
I'm going to have to leave the country if I ever want a breath of air .	5
I'm going to jump .	5
I'm going to need you to put your hands up .	0,5

I'm hungry .	5
I'm hurt and ...	5
I'm in bad shape .	5
I'm in rehab ?	2,5,6
I'm involved with someone else .	5
I'm just an old farm boy .	5
I'm just as old as I look .	5
I'm just not up to my usual self .	5
I'm just so scared .	2,5
I'm just starting to feel like ... Pretty alone .	5
I'm just tired .	0,1,5
I'm just ... so frustrated .	0,1,5
I'm leaving you , my dear .	5
I'm leaving .	5
I'm not at my best over the phone .	5
I'm not doing it alone .	2,5,6
I'm not feeling well . This won't take long .	5
I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	5
I'm not lying .	0,5
I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	0,2,5
I'm not playing at being provost marshal . And I never heard of luck that didn't run out .	0,5
I'm not ready to retire yet .	5
I'm not really . It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog .	5
I'm not sure how much good all this talking's doing .	5
I'm not usually this fragile .	5
I'm not very good at that .	5
I'm obsolescing like this old straw - bottomed cruiser of ours .	5
I'm out of my mind ?	5
I'm really not sure .	5,6
I'm really sorry , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
I'm really sorry .	5
I'm sentimental about old people .	5
I'm sick and tired of this delay .	5
I'm sick .	5

I'm sorry I snapped at you .	5
I'm sorry if I spoiled a print .	5
I'm sorry that I could not divulge the truth to you of all men .	5
I'm sorry they don't like me .	5
I'm sorry this had to happen , [PERSON] .	5
I'm sorry to disturb you .	5
I'm sorry to have bothered you .	5
I'm sorry to hear about your little loss .	5
I'm sorry to hear that , Lady Fingers .	5
I'm sorry to hear that , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
I'm sorry to hear that .	5
I'm sorry we got here too late to see you dance .	1,5
I'm sorry , gentlemen ...	5
I'm sorry , Grandfather . I've got to get some air .	1,5

I'm sorry . I'm just frustrated .	1,5
I'm sorry . I'm sorry .	5
I'm supposed to be taking care of you .	0,5
I'm sure you don't mean that .	5
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	5
I'm talking too much .	5
I'm telling you , I thought I was the best .	5
I'm terribly sorry .	5
I'm the last installment and that troubles me .	5
I'm tired of being only three inches high .	5
I'm tired .	5
I'm too old to be traded in .	5
I'm too tired .	5
I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn .	5
I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	5
I'm unhappy .	5
I'm very sorry about that , Miss.[LOCATION] . .	5
I'm very upset , [PERSON] .	0,5
I'm ... I'm sorry .	5
I've been aboard the [PERSON] too long .	1,5
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again .	5
I've been having weather problems .	5
I've been in all night .	5
I've been sick , [PERSON] .	5
I've been stuck here for 20 , years .	5
I've been taking these pills for my cold and they knock me out .	5
I've been trying to find you , but ...	5
I've even ... Maybe you won't admit it , but you love me . - [PERSON] .	5
I've got a headache , [PERSON] .	5
I've got a scar .	5
I've got bad news for you , GJ .	5
I've got to go to [LOCATION] , first plane .	5
I've had a very trying evening .	5
I've had the flu .	5
I've lied and used people all my life because I thought everybody did .	5
I've lost , pounds on the horses .	5
I've missed so much !	5
I've never been dumped before , that ... didn't feel awesome .	5
I've never before known anyone who was really brave .	5
I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today .	0,1,5
I've never tried to kill myself successfully .	5
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years .	5
If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	5
If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do .	5,6
If I could only close my eyes for a few hours .	5
If I spoke , you barely answered .	5
If I told you what we've been through ...	5
If I'd only figured it out before maybe we wouldn't have been trapped down here .	5
If men and nations had this goodness that I speak of , I would be willing to share all this ... My records , everything .	5
If only I'd done a better job .	5
If she was young and beautiful , I forgive you .	5
If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do .	5
If there were more time ...	5
If we could be like this forever it would be great	5
If we had known , we would have greeted you with flowers .	5
If you die , your type will be extinct	5
If you don't eat and sleep , you have to expect accidents like that .	5
If you would've had four fours , you would've won .	5
Imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles .	5
In fact , we're so bad that we're disbanding .	5
In jail for years and they suddenly found it was another chap .	5
In the end , we would be masters of a wrecked and hungry planet .	5
In the last century , the islanders were starving .	5
In your world if The Neverending Story is fading no child will ever know about Junior .	5
Is it all gone ?	5
Is it that you think it'll be better for ... for all of us if you go away ?	5
Is not no one , who could take care of him ?	5
Is that it ?	5,6
Is there no justice in the world ?	0,1,5,6
Isn't that what's wrong with the world today ?	5
It adds a few miles to our trip , but somehow I've become a little sentimental .	5
It affects her every day .	5
It ain't all that easy , son ....	5
It breaks my heart .	5
It could work if the government would spend more money .	5
It didn't feel to me like you were interested in talking just now .	5
It does matter .	5
It doesn't happen often these days .	5
It doesn't have to be like this .	5
It doesn't make sense .	5
It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	0,5
It drags at your heart till ... you can't do anything but look back .	5
It ended very badly .	5
It forces me to beg as a beggar .	5
It gives me a terrible pain .	5
It hasn't been all that pleasant for you , has it Mr. [PERSON] ?	5
It hasn't been easy , has it ?	5
It hurts a little .	5
It hurts me when people laugh at you .	5
It hurts , but he doesn't show it .	5
It hurts , hurts , hurts .	5
It is not a pivotal project in your career .	5
It is not the one .	5
It is probable that the last dose is fatal .	5
It is too expensive to maintain , [PERSON] !	5,6
It isn't like it used to be .	5
It isn't that . It's what [PERSON] said .	5,6
It made me Mink about all of us being together again and how we used to be .	5
It makes me sad .	5
It makes my heart sad .	5
It must be a mistake , he was clever ...	5,6
It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful .	5,6
It seems I try to do the impossible .	5
It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	5
It sometimes never goes away . How you talk .	5
It takes away the pain .	5
It was awful !	5
It was blocking him from coming out .	5
It was certainly a heart attack !	5,6
It's all here .	6
It's an investment ?	6
It's as if ordinary human beings , living ordinary lives , had suddenly vanished from the [LOCATION] , and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people .	6
It's back !	6
It's been over a week you've been gone .	6
It's been ... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work .	3,6
It's beyond me how the more money a corporation loses , the more it makes , because of the carryovers with the write - offs .	6
It's funny , she didn't mention a husband .	6
It's getting real bright out here .	6
It's hard to believe about [PERSON] .	6
It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex for 200 , years .	6
It's hard to believe , isn't it ?	6
It's impossible !	6
It's impossible . [PERSON] ...	5,6
It's impossible . Now time is up , [LOCATION]'s doing it's audit .	0,5,6
It's incredible stupidity ...	0,5,6
It's just beginner's luck .	0,5,6
It's just me .	6
It's like they're running an errand , and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand .	6
It's [PERSON] ! [PERSON] from [LOCATION] .	3,6
It's me , [PERSON] .	6
It's more than my job's worth !	0,6
It's not all a lie , [PERSON] .	0,5,6
It's portable , long - range , very expensive .	6
It's somehow able to bend light .	6
It's the first time he's told me the truth !	6
It's unbelievable .	6
It's working .	3,6
[PERSON] , aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry ?	6
[PERSON] , what happened ?	6
[PERSON] fucking christ . - $ ? - Yes , sir .	0,6
[PERSON] , this is a fairly young guy .	6
Jesus !	6
Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch .	6
[PERSON] , are we leaving ?	6
[PERSON] ... ?	6
Joséphine ?	6
Judge , it's our theory that Mr. [PERSON] is being framed in this case .	6
Judges need to be educated , the public needs to be educated , the Department of Justice needs to be educated on exactly what's going on here .	5,6
[PERSON] does not get on that helicopter with the Royals . Instead she goes over to [PERSON]'s house and tries to kill him ?	6
Junior when are you going to learn the difference between a rock and a nose ?	0,6
Just one ?	6
Just what is this relationship between you and our friend ?	6
Just when I think you're dead , you always come back .	6
Ka - rumph ! We were smashed to port .	0,6
[PERSON] didn't even look at me .	6
knots through the harbour ?	6
[PERSON] , he shouldn't be up here .	0,6
l pumped your stomach . Oh , God .	2,6
Lacy , watch out !	2,6
Ladies , I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros .	3,6
Leader , party just got bigger .	6
LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED , UNDRESS , SHOWER , BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED	2,6
Leon , why are you so good to us ?	6
Let me give you this watch .	3,6
Let me have secrets .	6
Let me in ! Let me in !	6
Let's just time [PERSON] as he comes charging to the rescue ! - What's going on here ?	6
Let's not get carried away here .	6
Let's put this on your wrist . What is that ? Ok , this is a digital heart monitor .	2,6
Lieutenant , what the hell is that thing ?	0,6
Like [PERSON] lost control ?	6
Like one time , I was with this guy and he came into my bedroom and he was naked , except he still had his socks on .	6
Like what ?	6
Like your shoes , it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did .	6
Listen to this , there were some hard drives in the copy store that belonged to Sandstorm's fixer .	6
Listen , today is my birthday and the girls give me a party .	6
Look at all that underwear .	6
Look at all these happy families .	6
Look at you , baby girl ! Hey , you ready to blow this joint or what ?	3,6
Look at your eyes !	6

Look !	3,6
Look . Look ! Look !	6
Looks a lot like your house , doesn't it ?	6
Looks like he's in great shape , don't he ?	6
Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh . - Dress it . Quickly .	0,6
Looks like we got a slumber party on the third floor .	6
Looks like we're going that way .	6
Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] !	6
[PERSON] , don't you have your own secretary ?	6
lt was [PERSON] . - How do you - l tailed him .	6
Lucito , huh ?	6

Madame is canceling the engagement ?	6
Madame , if you don't think about food , what do you think about ?	6
Magic ?	6
Majesty I can present ... my young daughter , the new Countess of [PERSON] ?	6
Make your wish .	3,6
Man , he is a lot bigger .	6
Man , I always thought it was the mezcal talking , but after seeing this , I think he was right .	6
Many of you aren't wearing battle gear .	5,6
[PERSON] , nice to meet you .	3,6
[PERSON] -[PERSON] , how do you do ?	6
Mark : There's a big wind coming !	6
[PERSON] has disappeared .	0,2,5,6
Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour .	6
[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	6
Maybe he'd better start carrying his own matches . Oh ?	6
Maybe I expected him to be Daddy and he wasn't .	6
Maybe I should just go back to the clinic ?	6
Maybe it's me and [PERSON] .	6
Maybe she has a sister .	6
Maybe that's where they're keeping the kids .	6
Maybe they're buddies after all .	6
Maybe you sleep together once in a while .	6
Me not work ?	6
[PERSON] , are you OK ?	2,5,6
[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	6
Miss what ?	6
Miss [PERSON] is going with you ?	6

Mr who ?	6
Mr. [PERSON] ? It's been so long . I almost didn't recognize you .	6
Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	6
Mr. [PERSON]'s changed with the times .	6
Mr. [PERSON] , do you think really that I could be a star ?	6
Mr. [PERSON] knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question .	5,6

I devour ... Every time I think of you .	3

I wish I could spend more than two hours with you .	5
I would like to proudly present the newest member of the [PERSON] family , [PERSON] !	3,6
I would want no one else .	3
I , on the other hand , had beaten them at their own system and subsequently [PERSON] rather effortlessly , floating up from mere marketing through the corridors of policy and on to the board and along the way promoting [PERSON]	3
I'd be delighted .	3
I'd love to .	3
I'll be fine .	3,5
I'll be in the hotel lobby : sharp .	3

If I hadn't seen you on the news , I wouldn't have known who his partner was .	6
If this is an escape route , why didn't you escape long ago ?	6
Is there anybody here ?	6
ISI is sending someone important to meet the CIA .	6
It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	3
It had to be filled with love .	3
It may be the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours .	3
It might help .	3
It provides us that delicious house over there .	6
It still has the keys , Mr. [PERSON] ? - Oui .	6
It's a road trip and a party rolled into one .	3
It's all right . I'll have to bring our sledge . Hurry .	3

Smile .	3
So I guess growing up in the wetback section of [LOCATION] wasn't that bad .	3
So is it true that if you commit a sin out of fear it is not necessarily a sin after all ?	2
So now they're best friends ?	6
So you really think they're keeping the missiles on a ship ?	6

The best , smartest , most interesting women in the world ?	6
The blood of [LOCATION] knows all truth .	3
The brooding eyes ...	2
The chance to be an active player in the defence of their country .	3
The Cold War is over , Mrs. Acting President .	3
The devil is always waiting in the shadows .  	2
The hostage negotiator's on his way , sir .	2
The Hundjager I killed was Verrat .	3
The important thing is that you stand up there and take your cuts , OK ?	3
The Kid will have to play him .	2
The King accepts our proposal with great enthusiasm .	3
He likes to kick the shit out of white trash like you , boy .	1
He looks like a drunk .	1
He never spoke .	1
He polluted their guts with language that shouldn't be inside of no man !	1
He pumps his face full of Novocaine , and then , with his scalpel begins to slice away his features one by one .	1
He ran over [LOCATION] like you'd run over a dog and never bothered to stop his car .	1
He said that to scare us .	1,2
He says that he's looking at a giant asshole from [LOCATION] .	1
He stole them turnips .	1
He swallowed his key .	1
He swears he has no idea where [PERSON] is , but his phone records tell a different story .	1
He sweats gasoline that man !	1
He that is himself a confessed traitor .	1
He thought it was sinful .	1
He tries to prove he's a real man and he's not .	1
He walks into the house without even knocking .	1
He was a loser too .	1
He was my friend , you dumb bitch !	1
He was ... fine .	1
He wasn't much of a man .	1
He would present his incontestable alibi and it would be in safety forever .	1
He's a contemptible little pervert who's ...	1
He's a gutless wonder .	1
He's a male chauvinist .	1
He's a punk , Rocky .	1
He's a sneaky little shit just like you , right ?	1
He's as bad as his uncle .	1
He's come for the king . - You snake !	1
He's great if you happen to like a tall , blond , Prussian , Nordic , Aryan , Nazi type .	1
He's not making a whole lot of sense .	1
He's on every channel .	1
He's peeing on me .	1
He's ready for a fall .	1,2,3
He's so damn mean , he can't get along with anybody .	1
He's such a liar .	1
He's worse than [PERSON] Tex.	1
Headless corpses .	1
Hear me , vain and foolish mortal woman .	1
Hello again .	1
Her cunt .	1
Here's my answer , you dirty ...	1
Hey , ass - wipe , All the emo freaks belong on the bleachers . Go !	1
Hey , [PERSON] , while you're down there trying to figure out the female race ... you might as well take a bath .	1
Hey , don't piss on any firewood !	1
Hey , freak - face , we found your pals .	1,3
Him !	1
His skin . Like a bone or a tendon .	1
Hit him with your purse , ya pussy .	1
Hmm . - ( imitates monkey gibbering )	1
Hold the fishbowl .	1
How about paying for something you drop by accident ?	1
How about that mess .	1
How can such a civilization survive ... which permits their women to put things like that on their heads ?	1
How can you ask me that now ? I'm sorry .	1
How can you be so inhuman ?	1
How can you drink that shit ?	1
How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in [LOCATION] with a glass of cappuccino coffee ?	1
How can you stand there dripping all over their lobby with no heel , no luggage , and say it's my fault we have no room ?	1
How did I get mixed up with a bum like him ?	1
How did I get such a smart - ass kid ?	1
How did you get to be a captain ?	1
How do you expect him to pay us ?	1
How long do you expect the world to believe those aren't your soldiers ?	1
How long do you think we'll have to stay in this hellhole ?	1
How many deals do you think get cut in the men's room ?	1
How much longer ?	1
How much of that junk are we gonna bring up ?	1
How stupid .	1
How this could become part of the legacy of The Village Voice is depressing to me .	1
How you hate the villain .	1
How's it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins ?	1
Howdy's got worms .	1,5
Humans are dumb .	1
Hurry up , suckers , you're dragging !	1
I ain't aiming for you to go to [PERSON] ' and gobble like a hog !	1
I always said the Union National was a phoney bank .	1
I am going to report you to the police .	1
I am going to throw up .	1
I am not the man you thought I was .	1,5
I am sick and tired of this contemptible young man !	1
I am sure you will find her in the fraternity house .	1
I am very busy ... please !	1
I believe whoever killed Detective [PERSON] had recently been in a slaughterhouse .	1
I bet he has fleas .	1
I bet [PERSON] was porking her ... And taking the money to keep her in style .	1
I bet you don't even like girls , do you ?	1
I call it to your attention that only one of you has reported here this morning properly dressed .	1
I can hardly wait for you to grow up .	1
I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look .	1
I can steal it , Mr. [PERSON] ?	1
I can't believe that you believe that .	1
I can't take any more of this .	1,2
I can't tell the boy from a doorpost .	1
I can't think of anything more sappy .	1
I can not accept you as [PERSON]'s son .	1,5,6
I certainly don't consciously realise it , and I think that's pretty rotten of you to say that .	1
I couId vomit .	1,6
I could do wonders with your dismembered body .	1
I didn't believe in the prophecies .	1
I didn't come here for grief counseling . I came for my inheritance .	1,5
I didn't like this boy to begin with , but no man that wasn't sincere could stage a fight like this against all odds .	1
I do hate you !	1
I do hope it won't affect your ego !	1
I do not drink with thieves and pirates .	1
I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	1
I do not like this side of you .	1
I do not think that's important , right ?	1
I do not want to hear one more insubordinate word ... from anyone in this platoon .	1
I don't approve of people rushing around carrying loaded revolvers .	1
I don't care how you do it , but you find that desert rat .	1
I don't care in the least what he does .	1
I don't care what she looks like . I don't like the company she keeps .	1
I don't care .	1
I don't feel very good .	1,2,5
I don't get your generation's humour .	1,5,6
I don't know what the bastard expect of me .	1
I don't know what's up , what shit you've been through to put you in that state .	1,5
I don't like it , [PERSON] .	1
I don't like no one .	1
I don't like the way you're treating [PERSON] and Mammy .	1
I don't like this .	1,2
I don't like to take mortgages from widows .	1
I don't like your type in my streets .	1
I don't make deals with peasants !	1
I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !	1
I don't need you to tell me what our priorities are , [PERSON] .	1
I don't pay you good money to have you jerk me around .	1
I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months ... but the thought that I should split my bank account with you ... that you should take half of my life's savings ... that is really too much for me , sir .	1
I don't think a lot of us stopped and thought , This could be our sister or our brother .  	1,5
I don't think I want body - to - body contact .	1
I don't think she's intelligent either .	1
I don't think this bullshit's funny .	1
I don't trust her .	1
I don't want any of that slop .	1
I don't want this no more .	1
I don't want to see them .	1
I feel all rotten inside .	1
I find it really insulting that you assume it has to be a guy .	1
I forgot about it .	1,5
I get seasick . I absolutely hate boats .	1
I got a hunch [PERSON] ain't got his mind on his business .	1
I got a lousy temper and an awful accent . I sound toffee - nosed .	1
I got stupid .	1,5
I got ta jet . Really ?	1
I got ta stop that fool .	1
I guess it's not in here . - I guess not .	1
I had a dream that it wasn't right .	1,5
I had got addicted to watching porn .	1,5
I had to torpedo him .	1,5
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought by anyone by the name of [PERSON] .	1
I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances .	1
I hardly recognize him with his mouth closed .	1
I hate bankers .	1
I hate public transport .	1
I hate that cheap little bastard .	1
I hate when you use the word  superfluous  .	1
I hate you , [PERSON] .	1
I hated you ...	1
I have asked you here to meet the woman selected to represent the most discriminating publication in the world , Quality .	1
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society .	1
I hear she comes real cheap .	1
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp .	1
I just can't keep doing this .	1,2,5
I just can't seem to throw anything out .	1,5
I just don't fit behind a desk , I I'm not cut out for it , I feel dry - docked .	1,5
I just got this crew broke in , so don't go screwing 'em up with your old - fashioned ways .	1
I just hate to hear you blaspheme .	1
I knew I couldn't trust you .	1
I knew you were gonna say that .	1
I know all about you , back from your first fight with Apollo Creed .	1
I know all those stories .	1
I know exactly where I am .	1
I know now that you're a man who employs business methods ... which in [LOCATION] would be punished by death .	1
I know you always say you're not like him . But here you are , scrubbing up for the next surgery instead of fighting for the man that you love .	1
I know you drink on the quiet , and I know how much you drink .	1
I know you women got ta pretend to be offended .	1
I lied .	1,5
I love tits as much as any guy ... . . but why would I pay some hag money for some supernatural chicanery ... . . coupled with sagging , wrinkled boobs ?	1
I made a deal with a cop once .	1
I made some dumb mistakes ...	1,5
I mean , aside from all of this junk .	1
I mean , didn't you feel like A complete piece of gutless , spineless , Primordial slime ?	1
I mean , I know writing speeches is writing ... but it's not what I really wan na do .	1
I might have been a lot of things , but I never was a tramp .	1
I need a minute .	1
I never saw a more gross neglected duty in my life .	1
I only hate you and despise you .	1
I regret the things that I done .	1,5
I regret your aggressiveness , [PERSON] .	1
I see you're as adept at breaking into houses as you are into cars , [PERSON] .	1,6
I served next to your jellied spine for two decades .	1
I should feed a strange mouth ?	1
I shouldn't be this drunk .	1
I still insist he's paranoid .	1
I still killed three women .	1,5
I still need it when I'm afraid , like a baby who needs a light on in the dark .	1,2,5
I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little hopes and dreams ?	1
I sure couldn't tell you .	1
I sure pity the people that have to breathe in the daytime .	1
I swear I didn't know .	1,2,5,6
I swear that man moves like dead lice were falling off him .	1
I think he's right . - I don't want to hear it !	1
I think I could turn and live with animals .	1
I think Mr [PERSON] is disturbed because he can't take you to the party and dance all over your feet .	1
I thought it read like a cheap , dime - store novel .	1
I told him his wife was a dyke .	1
I told you no liquor in the office .	1
I treat her like what she is to me , nothing .	1
I wan na know whose idea it was to have children .	1
I want her out of here , Doctor .	1
I want them booked on felony charges , destruction of private property , and assault .	1
I want you to have a heart attack and die so we never have to do this again .	1
I want you to know that I hate your fucking guts .	1
I wanted to apologize for the other night And I was wondering if I can have an opportunity To see you again today and -- and just talk .	1,5
I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife .	1
I was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .	1,5
I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free [LOCATION] ... from an unclean tyrant .	1
I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you !	1
I will show you freaky ...	1
I wish it were anybody's child but yours !	1
I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face .	1
I wonder how she likes it now , being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl .	1
I work with a junkie ?	1,6
I wouldn't dream of using such a tool .	1,2
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp !	1
I wouldn't trust you with gold . That's why this is only worth a penny .	1
I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him .	1
I'll be forced to shoot you again .	1
I'll be sick ...	1
I'll be stuck here doing your work while you run all over the city fighting crime or something .	1
I'll be the man .	1
I'll blacken this punk so he'll ...	1
I'll disinherit him .	1
I'll never eat fish again .	1
I'll shoot the son of a bitch in the balls !	1
I'll swear that into my own grave .	1
I'll teach you to make meaningless small talk to everyone ...	1
I'm ashamed of you , [PERSON] .	1
I'm ashamed of you .	1
I'm ashamed to put a picture of [PERSON] in a room like this .	1
I'm behaving like years old .	1
I'm getting leery of this guy .	1
I'm going to puke	1
I'm gonna be sick .	1
I'm gonna get that bastard .	1
I'm gonna take him back to the orphanage .	1
I'm gonna tell .	1
I'm gonna vomit .	1
I'm headed for hell anyway	1
I'm in the shithouse .	1
I'm listening to you eat .	1
I'm not coming .	1
I'm not going to the chair 'cause that ape got trigger - happy !	1
I'm not interested in some monkey riding the horse .	1
I'm not proud of that .	1
I'm not some gun for hire .	1
I'm not takin' a shower with him .	1
I'm not the same pathetic , trusting fool that I was a couple of days ago .	1
I'm old enough to be your mother , almost .	1
I'm pleased to meet you , ugly wop son of a bitch .	1
I'm really tempted to take you along with me ... but I'm just afraid that I'd awaken some morning ... and find you'd made a necklace with my teeth .	1
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him .	1
I'm so bored with this face .	1
I'm stuck with guys down here that are too dumb to roll rocks down a steep hill .	1
I'm such a pain in the ass these days I deserve myself .	1
I'm sure you feel the same about me , so let's stay out of each other's way .	1
I'm telling you , this cocksucker's trouble .	1
I'm tired of this baby crap !	1
I'm uncomfortable with whatever this is .	1
I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	1
I've been looking for you all over , hoping you were dead .	1
I've been to that scumbag town .	1
I've had a thousand chances to kill you , dirty , sell out cop .	1
I've isolated her forever .	1
I've lost another man and that bastard thinks it's funny .	1
I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer .	1
I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch .	1
Idiot !	1
Idle boasting , I assure you .	1
If a man shall be drunk on duty , he shall receive the same fate .	1
If [PERSON] comes back , I'll give him a bust right in the mouth .	1
If ever a funeral laid an egg , that one did .	1
If he can't find enough facts to break you with , I'll give him a couple .	1
If I catch any of you guys in my stuff , I'll kill you .	1
If I didn't love these boys so much , I think I'd kill them myself .	1
If I have to compete with someone , you might let me start on even terms .	1
If I thought I made you feel like that , I'd kill myself .	1
If it's so nutritious , how come I don't see you eating it ?	1
If that slob was a penologist , I'm a jet airplane pilot .	1
If there's any decency in you ...	1
If there's any justice , let him get mugged by the man who took my watch !	1
If they don't they may learn to appreciate it , but it will never become part of their soul .	1
If this guy has any information , why hasn't he contacted you already ?	1,6
If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen .	1
If you can find a job , if it pays more than $ 50 , a week ... and if you don't get involved with another maniac .	1
If you discount the angina , the migraines and the gastritis , there's nothing wrong with me .	1
If you don't let go , I'll ...	1
If you don't tell me all you know , you become an accessory before the fact of murder .	1
If you ever talk to me like that again ... I'll make sure you never win another election in your life .	1
If you had any chivalry in you , or were nice ...	1
If you lay one finger on that poor , sweet , helpless girl ... you'll despise yourself forever .	1
If you thought as much about being honest as you do about being smart ...	1
If you're dirty , you're going .	1
Ignore that beast , [PERSON] . You joined the church Because you had no talents , no skills ,	1
Imagine getting gussied up like this to watch a lot of Supreme Court judges chew .	1
In case it slipped your mind , it's gunnery stations at .	1
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy all over the place .	1
Indeed throughout the entire interview ... he insisted they call him [PERSON] which is his right name and refused to answer to the name of [PERSON] .  	1
Instant gratification takes too long .	1
Irritating little sod .	1
Is murder a right reserved for that hated nation That has taken everything else from me ...	1
Is not it so ?	1
Is that intelligent banking ?	1
Is that the only word your mind can understand ?	1
Is that what they taught you at Yale Law School ?	1
Is there something special about this group that interests you ? No .	1
Is this one of your shenanigans ?	1
Is this the admiral's harem ?	1
No ! No ! No !	1,2
No . [PERSON] is definitely not ' with me  ' . 	1
No . That's another lie , isn't it ?	1,5
Nobody eats that shit .	1
Nobody knows what goes on inside a police car , right , [PERSON] ?	1
Nobody likes a whiner .	1
Nobody makes a fool out of my wife .	1
Not one word of what he's saying is being printed in that state !	1
Nothing at [LOCATION] .	1
Nothing but talk .	1
Nothing doing .	1
Nothing Mr. [PERSON] has to say means shit to you , does it , [PERSON] ?	1
Now he takes an utter stranger into the family .	1

Now , look . You're a vaguely amusing and not unattractive guy , but I'm not even remotely interested .	1
Now , you got any more smart talk ?	1
Now ...	1
Obscenely decaying flesh .	1
Of course I'm sweating , you moron .	1
Oh yeah , that's you .	1
Oh , I'm sorry .	1,5

Oh , your parents should be ashamed of themselves	1,5
OK , the same day , I'm reading the Post and there's this item on [PERSON] , the radio guy who does those gross jokes about [LOCATION] and the Betty Ford Center .	1
On the other hand , they do have some rather nasty habits .	1
Once that secret mentions the visit of the president at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space .	1
One of the many troubles with you , Harry , is , you never know where your movie scripts leave off and life begins .	1
One of you better tell the lieutenant that the waterhole I come by this morning is all muddied up .	1
One should be able to take care of one's possessions .	1
One that will scream in the middle of the night and you'll have to stumble downstairs in the dark and change his soiled diapers .	1,5
Only a gourd - head would ask a stupid question like that .	1
Only whores smoke in public .	1
Open that door again , you'll run a 3 - legged race to the undertaker .	1
Or a liar .	1
Or are you lying ?	1
or even scrap 	1
Or it might've just fallen overboard dropped there by some drunken old rummy .	1
Or it's just [PERSON] that smells like street shit over there .	1
Or you can go straight back to your home on the streets .	1
Our assessment is , Your Honor , is that they are responsible , at least in part , for both the creation of these ads and for the development of these ads . they're actually instructions to pimps on how to post an ad that works .	1,2
Our friend  [PERSON] . 	1

That kid's a monster !	1
That makes no sense .	1
That old bastard's killed more guys than the electric chair .	1
That old man is a sick character .	1
That ought to teach those [LOCATION] to stay away from my house .	1
That seems to me like a darn short prayer for a sinner like Dude .	1
That sounds worse than it was .	1,6
That stupid little bastard .	1
That you don't want to live here , or in [LOCATION] , or [LOCATION] , or any other place where people have to live on top of each other , and they don't have enough room to walk , or breath , or smile .	1

How do you know ?	2,6
How is that going to look at home ?	2
How many ? = All of us . - Sorry , not enough room .	2,6
How much do you think he heard ?	2
How much longer do you think your country will last ?	2
How much time has the world got ?	2
How the hell are you going to give it to me in public ?	2
How's Miss [PERSON] bearing up ?	2
Hurry , hurry !	2
I ... just afraid to lose you .	2
I admit I was nervous .	2
I ain't through talkin' with you yet !	2
I also know about the stakeouts , the tailings , the video cassettes .	2,6
I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze .	2
I always knew there was something strange about their crowd . What are you talking about ?	2
I am afraid of murder .	2
I am afraid that there is no coincidence here .	2
I am also concerned about the misinformation about nuclear waste .	2
I am aware of that , but to be seen together could be disastrous for us both .	2
I am not prepared for wells to run dry !	2
I am so sorry . Hi , buddy !	2
I can not believe it .	2,5,6
I can see panicked citizens taking to the streets if this gets out .	2
I can tell you now I was a little worried when I heard you weren't going to be here yourself .	2
I can't agree to the terms without the approval of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs .	2
I can't breathe in here .	2
I can't breathe !	2
I can't do this .	2,5
I can't fight you both .	2
I can't go through it ... You hear me ?	2,5,6
I can't go to the grand jury without him .	2,5
I can't keep this from the president any longer .	2,5
I can't save [PERSON] .	2
I can't see myself .	2
I can't start acting like a father now .	2,5
I can't take responsibility for this .	2
I can't tell you about it .	2
I can't think straight !	2
I can't trust nobody .	2
I can not fight .	2
I changed my mind .	2
I contacted the police , I contacted the FBI .	2
I could not get it off , [PERSON] .	2
I couldn't be certain your apartment was safe .	2
I couldn't hate you , so my hatred turned into an insane fear .	2
I couldn't ...	2,5
I declare , [PERSON] , sometimes I think you got psychic powers .	2,6
I didn't know anybody was going to be killed .	2
I didn't know what I was doing .	2
I didn't know what to do .	2
I didn't mean to kill him .	2
I didn't mean to offend you . I was just being me , you know ?	2,5
I didn't mean to oversell .	2
I didn't see him , but he hit me .	2
I didn't want to mess it up .	2,5
I do not know what to do .	2
I do not want unnecessary scandal . You have not to preoccupy yourself with that .	2
I do , patrón .	2
I don't expect nothing . I'm nonchalant .	2
I don't have any combat training , I don't think ...	2
I don't have much time .	2,5
I don't know about that .	2
I don't know about you guys ... but I got ta get outta here .	2,5
I don't know anything about being a commander .	2
I don't know anything about it .	2
I don't know how I got home that night . The most difficult part was trying to ... act normal when I paid off the babysitter .	2,6
I don't know what I may tell you .	2
I don't know what I'd do if I lost her .	2,5
I don't know what the hell to do .	2
I don't know what [PERSON] is ... now .	2
I don't know why I'm in such a hurry to get into trouble again .	2
I don't know , maybe we're all just spooked .	2
I don't know ... Maybe the batteries are dead .	2
I don't like this , any of it .	2
I don't think we can hold out that long before they find her .	2
I don't think you should drive .	2
I don't think you understand the situation . These guys are religious zealots .	2
I don't think you'll be able to stand it long .	2
I don't understand what's going on today .	2,5,6
I don't want any trouble .	2
I don't want her hurt at all .	2,3
I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .	2
I don't want to die !	2,5
I don't want to die .	2
I don't want to get shot .	2
I don't want to lose you .	2
I don't want to miss this flight . I have a special rate .	2
I don't want us to end up enemies .	2
I don't want you to be angry with me for having predicted it . What ?	2
I ended up in the hospital .	2
I fear really fear for the future .	2
I fear that what life remains to me ...	2
I fear the wrath of God .	2
I feel like I messed it up .	2,5
I feel some concern for his safety .	2
I got enough problems with my old man .	2,5
I got up and started to speak and the long powerful arm of [PERSON] reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the neck .	2
I got ta get back . Move it back !	2
I guess since I'm here , I got no choice , huh ?	2,5
I guess there's this part of me that hopes he doesn't even make it ...	2
I guess .	2
I had fights ... . . and every one of 'em I was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal .	2,5
I had made the first real enemy of my life .	2
I had the most frightening experience .	2
I hate to do this , but I think we better get him to a hospital .	2
I have a kid . I have a kid . - Hmm ?	2,5
I have a terrible feeling he cut off my head .	2
I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did .	2,5
I have no defence against forgery !	2
I have risen to a difficult task .	2
I have something inevitable to tell you .	2,5
I have to get out of here . or what's left of my family is going to die .	2
I have to warn the Soviets in the clearest possible terms that they risk taking us to the brink of an armed confrontation with incalculable consequences for all mankind .	2
I haven't been , uh , entirely honest With you , and , uh ...	2
I haven't done anything wrong .	2
I haven't even told my wife yet . You haven't ?	2
I hear we can expect a bumpy ride tonight .	2
I hear you , [PERSON] .	2
I heard he was connected with the government during the war , a spy .	2
I heard some shooting , Sheriff .	2
I heard you ran into some trouble today .	2
I hope every member of this body feels as I do .	2
I hope I'm not obscure .	2
I hope it doesn't get any worse .	2
I hope [PERSON] isn't watching .	2
I hope not .	2
I hope so .	2
I hope that while we're waiting , another disaster doesn't occur .	2
I hope that's not what I'm hearing .	2
I hope they haven't spotted us .	2
I hope this doesn't ruin my tryout for cheerleader .	2
I just don't want it to happen to my sisters , or your kids , or the next kid .	2
I just feel like if I don't do what you want you're gonna leave me .	2
I just hope there's no snakes round here .	2
I just wan na go home .	2,5
I just want it in a flaky pastry .	2
I just ...	2
I knew my ill - fitting clothes were unsuited to the exertions that lay before me .	2
I know how to use this ! - Don't make me use this thing !	2
I know that you are tough .	2
I know this is a battle we can't win , and all I ask is that you spare him , he's a good kid .	2
I know you are , but this just got times harder for me to get out of .	2,5
I know . I don't want to say . I know how upset you'll be . I know how upset I was .	2
I know . Ring the alarm ?	2
I lost my virginity and was raped , and I. . .	2,5
I made it ashore , but I got separated from the other survivors .	2
I mean I can't swim .	2
I mean , after my exorcism , I - I've strived to lead A good , clean , decent life .	2
I mean , I realize you don't have to answer me , but don't forget I helped you into this world , okay ?	2
I might get bit , after all .	2
I might not be around for much longer .	2,5
I need protection .	2
I need some protection now from [PERSON] .	2
I need your help .	2
I never danced in public before .	2
I never thought we'd die here	2,5
I only hope it isn't too high for you here .	2
I ought to have a doctor .	2
I parked it in ... in a parking lot and I just ... I forgot where I parked it .	2,5
I really am in a hurry .	2
I really can't believe it .	2
I really have no explanation for that , Senator .	2
I really have . - I - I - I must go now .	2
I really need your help , Mr [PERSON] .	2,3
I remember one on the porch , waiting in darkness so complete I couldn't see his face .	2
I saw one of those things take thirty hits and keep on coming .	2
I see my child ... in different poses ... that look like she was drugged .	2
I see six sides to every risk and reasons not to take it .	2
I see the monster .	2
I see them coming , baby I'm throwing myself in the fucking ocean !	2
I see . So what do we do now ?	2,6
I shall die on the gallows .	2
I should have taken my chances with the cannibals .	2
I smell blood .	2
I suppose she means well .	2,5
I suppose when a fellow bucks up against a big organisation like that , one man by himself can't get very far .	2
I tell you , gentlemen , we have a problem on our hands .	2
I think he's been recording my telephone .	2
I think I'm gonna faint .	2
I think my dog's escaping .	2
I think sister [PERSON] would be much better at it than me .	2,3
I think that we're lost .	2
I think they're gonna kill you with the press too .	2
I think we should talk .	2
I think we're being set up .	2
I think we're stuck .	2
I thought he'd kill me .	2
I thought you got lost .	2
I told him you guys wanted out as well .	2
I told you , this can get tough .	2
I took some funds from the con - amalgate account , I. . . To cover a loan . I. . .	2,5
I tried to make him see a psychiatrist .	2
I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady .	2
I want Mommy !	2
I want my baby back .	2
I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed .	2
I want to get out of there right now .	2
I want to go .	2,5
I want you to be on fucking guard , man .	2
I want you to pull over and stop so's we don't have an accident or worse .	2
I wanted to stop you from doing something you'd be sorry for .	2
I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .	2
I was afraid [PERSON] might have stolen the suitcase .	2
I was afraid of making a fool of myself .	2
I was afraid of that .	2
I was coming down the steps and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .	2
I was desperate .	2
I was frantic .	2
I was going nearly crazy 'cause I couldn't find Little Sheba .	2
I was holding her in my arms ...	2,5
I was in front and you were behind with a gun in my back .	2
I was more frightened than the defendant .	2
I was nearly arrested here three years ago .	2
I was plenty scared .	2
I was scared shitless they'd think I was still alive .	2
I was shot up pretty bad .	2
I was so worried that ...	2
I was the opposite . I was angry .	2,5
I was thinking my partner had gone over the edge .	2
I was threatened .	2
I was too nervous .	2
I was worried about you .	2,5
I wasn't really sure that Judge [PERSON] had a firm grip	2
I wasn't there when he died .	2,6
I will be punished , and I should be punished .	2
I will get [PERSON] out of the way .	2
I wish you Godspeed .	2
I won't ever do it again , I promise .	2
I won't go schizo , will I ?	2
I worked for you .	2,5
I worry about you , that's all .	2
I wouldn't dare answer that .	2
I wouldn't take the slightest risk now you've made such a great reputation for yourself in the Senate .	2
I wouldn't trust anybody .	2
I wouldn't want to face it .	2
I - I am working on it , and I will figure it out .	2
I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	2
I - I took some sleeping pills .	2
I - I'm in here .	2
I. . .	2,5
I. . . I can't .	2,5
I'd be too scared to do it .	2
I'd have to kill myself .	2
I'd like to know why I'm being shot .	2
I'd never fuck with you , because I really love you guys .	2
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 , to one .	2
I'll be late for the first bell !	2
I'll die if they send me to prison .	2
I'll get in trouble !	2
I'll get some help !	2
I'll get you now !	2
I'll hide you somewhere .	2
I'll kill you all !	2
I'll never be able to match that .	2,5
I'll tell them anything !	2
I'll try , but she's in danger , [PERSON] .	2
I'm a frightened tramp .	2
I'm a little bit frightened .	2
I'm afraid he's been stalling .	2
I'm afraid it can't be done , sir !	2
I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that .	2
I'm afraid of you ?	2
I'm afraid so .	2
I'm afraid to let her try .	2
I'm afraid .	2
I'm alarmed about you .	2
I'm attacked from all sides !	2
I'm burning .	2
I'm dizzy , I'm gonna faint .	2
I'm [PERSON] , sir .	2,6
I'm going after her .	2
I'm his prey .	2
I'm in a strange man surrounded by strangers in a strange room !	2
I'm in an awful hurry .	2
I'm in fear of my life , you know .	2
I'm just a bit dizzy . Can you stay with me for a bit ?	2
I'm just not certain it's the right thing .	2
I'm not certain there's a limit to what she'll do .	2
I'm not fit to be a senator !	2
I'm not opening that door and neither are you , and if you try ...	2
I'm not ready for this .	2
Killed the pain all right , but he almost died .	2
King [PERSON] says not only do I have to kill you ,	2
King [PERSON] , voodoo priest of the [LOCATION] posses .	2
l don't want to hurt a cop .	2,5
l needed him alive !	2
[PERSON] , are we going to make it to the island ?	2
Leave us alone .	2
Leon !	2,5
[PERSON] would not like it .	2
Let it be anybody but her .	2
Let me out , or I'll kill myself .	2
Let me out ! Right !	2
Let's get out of here !	2
Let's just worry about getting out of here .	2
Life can be infernally complex .	2
Life is more terrifying and more mysterious .	2
Lightning can kill you .	2
Listen , I really can't talk about this over the phone .	2
Living horrors of the deep were described today 	2
[PERSON] , be careful !	2
[PERSON] , don't go to him !	2
Look after you .	2
Look out !	2
Look , in what I do , there are sometimes pressures .	2
Look , sir , we haven't much time .	2
Look , there's something weird going on here , and I can't quite follow it .	2
Looks like trouble ahead .	2
Looks like trouble for your boss .	2
Looks to me like we're in hot water already .	2
Lord , camphor is the only known cure .	2,5
Love you , too .	2,5
Madam President , people will die .	2
Majesty , have mercy on me !	2
Man , they'd lock me up from now to [PERSON] .	2
[PERSON] , I - I - I love you .	2
Martial law .	2
[PERSON] ? Put that gun down .	2
May I ask what you're planning ?	2
May is a great scientist , but she also has destructive tendencies .	2
Maybe it's best I do remember .	2
Maybe they heard something .	2
Maybe we're about to find out .	2
Maybe we've missed him already .	2
Maybe you can talk this over later in private , maybe .	2
Mayday !	2
[PERSON]'s out of his mind .	2
Meanwhile , you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank .	2
Midship damage control won't answer .	2
Might be it needs dragging up .	2
[PERSON] , I was so scared .	2
[PERSON] , it's impossible !	2
Miss [PERSON] , before anything else happens ,	2
Miss Windy , the villa has been ransacked	2
Mister , is this Heaven here or not ?	2
Mom , you must have had a bad dream , that's all .	2
Mom ?	2
Mommy , help me .	2
Mommy , I saw a ghost .	2
Mommy , what happened to your hand ?	2
Most of their wounds won't heal properly .	2
Mr [PERSON] , sir ?	2
Mr President , what happens to me in the morning ?	2
Mr. [PERSON] , that sounds like a threat .	2
Mr. [PERSON] ... I'm in pain . I'm full of sedatives .	2
Mr. [PERSON] , you're playing with fire .	2
My brother must've found the keys .	2
My career will be ruined .	2
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax .	2
My God , she's coming inside . Oh , God .	2
My God , stop him !	2
My grandma's really sick ,	2,5
My husband will kill me when he finds out .	2
My life is in your hands .	2
My little finger , it's all black and blue .	2
My mommy hurt my head .  	2,5
My son's missing since last night .	2
My stools were a little loose .	2
My uncle is a hard , unforgiving man .	2
My vampire's in convulsions .	2
My wife is in bad shape .	2
Ned , don't .	2
[PERSON] ? How'd I get here ?	2
[PERSON] . [PERSON] , what happened ?	2
No matter what's happened , this child is going to need you .	2
No one can feel safe living in a community ... when there are reckless and irresponsible neurotics ... wandering about its thoroughfares armed with deadly weapons .	2
No sense taking any chances in this thing .	2
No - no - no - no ... now , see , half of my team is dead ... by your hand .	2,5
No , don't touch that !	2
No , he's different ! Please , Father , for me !	2,5
No , he's no [LOCATION] .	2
No , it isn't . Just because we aren't expecting resistance , don't relax on this one .	2
No , let's not risk it . OK .	2
No , Mr. [PERSON] , please don't call ...	2
No , [PERSON] ! Don't !	2
No , no , no .	2,5
No , no !	2
No , the flight must be stopped .	2
No , you don't !	2
No ! I don't know [PERSON] , I swear .	2
No ! Windy !	2,5
No . No . I just don't want any enemies .	2
Nobody better have a cold .	2
Not a victim , [PERSON] -- a target , like you .	2
Not covet thy neighbor's wife .	2
Not good . Let's not get caught in the car .	2
Not right away ! That wouldn't be fair .	2
Not so bad , but there's dirty weather ahead .	2
Not the gondola , not the gondola .	2
Not to come to [LOCATION] , at least not for a while .	2,5
Not written on those drowned faces out there But on the faces of dead thousands !	2
Nothing is guaranteed .	2
Nothing wild , right ?	2
Now he's found me .	2
Now she's going to [LOCATION] to measure glacial melt . By herself .	2
Now we are running out of ammunition .	2
Now , be careful , children .	2
Now , because I screwed up , read from that book , one lousy time , evil has found me .	2
Now , just a minute , gentlemen .	2
Now , that was probably a mistake because now you're in danger anyway .	2
Now , [PERSON] , remember , no speeding ! Watch yourself .	2
Now , you may kill me , but if you don't come to your senses and throw it down , they're gonna kill you .	2
Nuclear peace for years .	2,6
Nurse !	2,6
Nurse ...	2
Occupational hazard ?	2
Officer , please , for God's sake , they're looting the Food King !	2
Oh god , I promise I won't say anything .	2
Oh my God !	2,6
Oh no . Shit ! [PERSON] !	2
Oh , boundless heaven and earth Help me !	2
Oh , boy .	2
Oh , [PERSON] , I'm frightened .	2
Oh , dear me .	2
Oh , for [PERSON]'s sake , don't say anything about that around here .	2
Oh , God , no . Oh , no .	2,5
Oh , God , please help .	2
Oh , God , we thought they'd killed you .	2
Oh , God .	2
Oh , God . Where's my wimple ?	2
Oh , good gracious .	2
Oh , he's hurt !	2
Oh , I hope it's not serious .	2
Oh , [PERSON] ! God !	2
Oh , [PERSON] .	2,6
Oh , [PERSON] , I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow .	2
Oh , my God , no , I can't be bleeding again .	2,6
Oh , my God , we're being kidnapped .	2
Oh , my God . It's the devil .	2,6
Oh , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , it's happening .	2
Oh , no !	2,5
Oh , no ?	2,6
Oh , o dear ...	2
Oh , okay .	2
Oh , [PERSON] , won't you please give me the money ?	2
Oh , [PERSON] , I'm a coward .	2
Oh , shit , he's here .	2
Oh , shit !	2
Oh , shit .	2,5
Oh , this is terrible .	2
Oh , well I'm no psychiatrist ... . She looks to me like she needs professional help .	2,5
Okay ? - We're not dead yet ?	2,6
Once at sea , if we get there , our troubles will have just begun .	2
One look from the head of [LOCATION] can turn all creatures into stone .	2
One thing ... Admiral [PERSON] only allowed us planes ...	2
One , that I don't mess up as a manager .	2
Ooh ... Well , we almost had it there for a second ,	2
Open your eyes !	2
Or am I going mad ?	2
Or God knows in how many lifetimes you'll be paying for it .	2
Or perhaps you should be careful .	2
Or we have a problem with the judges .	2
Or - or maybe you mean embarrassing the badge .	2
Otherwise you'll never get out of [LOCATION] alive .	2
Otherwise , I fear not only for the safety of our men , but frankly , for their lives as well .	2
Otherwise ... she'll kill him .	2
Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel .	2
Our soldiers are dying in the inferno to be burning tanks .	2
Out in the country that , uh ...	2
[PERSON] could've been killed by that intruder .	2
Perhaps he killed [PERSON] , too .	2
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child .	2
Perhaps this was the one step too far .	2,5
Perhaps you could enlighten the jury as to what else the government's giving you in exchange for this testimony .	2
Perseus is moving into danger .	2
[PERSON] can't ride on that thing , not in her condition .	2,5
Please be careful .	2
Please be more careful in the future , Captain .	2
Please don't do this to me .	2,5
Please don't go .	2,5
Please don't hurt us .	2

Please don't spank me , Mr [PERSON] .	2,3

Please , we need help !	2
Please , you have to let me go .	2
Please !	2
Please . Please listen to me .	2
Please . Understand I was taken by surprise .	2,5
Please ...	2
Please ... No ...	2
Pray you get the chance .	2
Professor [PERSON] is gonna spot us .	2
Professor , I - I'd like to speak to you .	2
Queeg endangered the lives of the men .	2
Really scary .	2
Removed ?	2
Repeat , destroyers .	2
Ri ... [PERSON] , listen to me , he'll kill you . Please !	2
Right in the middle of our celebration ... the firebase got hit by a mortar attack .	2
Right now I am just freaking out .	2
Ring the alarm !	2
Rock , go !	2
Rocky , mind if I talk to you outside about a few things ?	2
Rocky's been hit with bombs .	2,5
[PERSON] put me onto this .	2
Run before they chop you down .	2
Run , [PERSON] !	2
Run !	2
Said it was ghastly .	2
Save me from my enemies .	2
School's gonna be a problem for the kids .	2
Seeking wealth and position is for the likes of you mere mortals	2
Seemed worried about it .	2
Self - defense .	2
Send somebody for the militia .	2
Sent what ?	2
She can't know we're nuns ! Why not ? What if [PERSON] and [PERSON] find her ?	2
She can't make it on her own .	2
She can't stay off that kidney machine too long .	2
She had a bit of an accident back there .	2
She killed her husband same as if she shot him .	2
She plans her suicide .	2,5,6
She pulls back on the trigger and at that moment I wake up screaming .	2
She shot me , at me .	2
She tried to kill me because I told her about Nately .	2
She was coming after me with this gun right in her two hands .	2
She was gonna turn me in .	2
She was nothing ... nothing human .	2
She went in there to find the Hope Diamond . Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud .	2,5
She ... She does not speak for the rest of us , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
She'll be dead before the sound gets there .	2
She'll kill you ! She killed him !	2
She's about eight months pregnant and , uh ...	2
She's fainted .	2
She's going to die if you don't help me .	2
She's gone .	2,5
She's gonna kill him , [PERSON] .	2
She's gonna kill him !	2
She's got the curse .	2
She's hysterical , beating ...	2
She's more frightened than anything .	2
She's turning into a corpse monster !	2
She's vulnerable , wide - open to be hurt badly .	2,5
Shh . Somebody's out there .	2
Shit , you scared me !	2,6
Shit ...	2
Shit's gonna hit the fan .	2
Shoot the fuck down !	2

We wouldn't last more than hours before we had a fatal accident !	2
We , uh , have several people in mind .	2,6
We ... we have a few more questions to ask .	2
We'll have to hope that that's enough .	2
We'll make it to [LOCATION] if you're not careful !	2
We'll never get to the airport .	2
We're all gonna die !	2

I don't like my boys getting hurt permanently .	5
I don't like to .	5
I don't need you falling apart on me .	5
I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation , but that is when it started .	5
I don't see myself in one of those bullshit nine - to - five jobs .	5
I don't think anything we can do would be of the slightest use .	5
I don't think even that would do it .	5
I don't think everybody goes through life thinking about child sex trafficking in the [LOCATION] .	5
I don't think I should join your campaign , you know .	5
I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all .	5
I don't think [LOCATION]'s ever coming back , [PERSON] .	5
I don't think we can get it done by Monday .	5
I don't think we have anything for you .	5,6
I don't trust him .	5,6

I don't want to harm you .	5
I don't want to put you to any trouble .	5
I don't want to raise him by myself .	5,6
I don't want to sound like a Debbie the [PERSON] , but no matter how many times you come up against the Communications Decency Act it's always gonna shut you down .	5
I doubt a court of inquiry will accept that .	5,6
I failed you .	5
I feel As a tear .	5
I feel I should be doing something , but I don't know what .	5
I feel like such a fool .	5
I feel not much better now .	5
I feel rather sorry for him , don't you ?	5
I feel so bad for [PERSON] .	5
I feel sorry .	5
I feel useless because I was born without it .	5
I fell over my feet most of the time .	5
I felt guilty about always being away from you and Papa .	5
I forget a lot of things and I. . .	5
I fucked up .	5
I gave [PERSON] ... Enough pain .	5
I get pissed off , my wife gets embarrassed , the kids are confused .	5
I get so bored I could scream .	5
I get to live in a place ... it's OK . Don't get me wrong . The air is clean .	5
I get to never see my parents again or my loved ones .	5
I get two bucks an hour , plus ten per cent of that goes to a bail fund .	5
I got a wife and a family I'm not with , [PERSON] ,	5
I got it , but I don't know .	5
I got too messed up ' bro .	5
I got what you gave me but I can't follow the instructions .	5
I guarantee you that these dreams or nightmares or whatever the hell they are will never bother you again .	5
I guess everybody had given up hope , including the doctors .	5
I guess I can't blame you .	5
I guess I don't take criticism very well . But I mean , I've had one day of work on this and two conversations about what's missing in my performance .	5
I guess I'm afraid you'll find me out .	5
I guess I'm just exhausted .	5
I guess one gets the face one deserves .	5
I guess she doesn't have nowhere else to go .	5
I guess she's gone for good .	5
I guess this is my last season .	5
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic to a guy like you .	5
I guess we're all trying to prove something to ourselves .	5
I had no right to put you through all that .	5
I had to sweat blood to get that .	5
I hadn't heard . I'm sorry .	5,6
I hadn't the heart to warn her .	5
I hate my life .	5
I hate myself for not using cutaways .	5
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble .	5
I have all this money , and no dress .	5
I have but one life ... and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny .	5
I have no close folks .	5
I have no idea what to do .	5
I have to kill people to live .	5
I have to live every single day of my life now with everything that's happened to me .	5
I have to spend half my life waiting for these time clocks to open .	5
I have to work .	5
I have too many scars .	5
I have worked and struggled to make myself an American .	5
I haven't any friends , [PERSON] .	5
I haven't had a job in four months .	5
I haven't the data yet .	5
I hit him too hard .	5
I hope I never get old and have to be in a wheelchair and have to depend on the ushers to help me out of church .	5
I hope I never wake up .	5
I hope it doesn't end here .	5
I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead .	5,6
I just don't wan na hurt her feelings .	5
I just don't want to see anybody hurt .	5
I just hate to see a good man go to waste .	5
I just keep thinking that he needed me and I wasn't there .	5
I just meant he didn't care for me .	5
I just needed a break .	5
I just think you're not gonna be able to go back to what you were .	5
I just wan na feel better .	5
I just want to be alone .	5
I just went to the store for the cookies .	5
I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want them to get in trouble .	5
I killed her .	5
I knew there'd be a catch to this .	5,6
I know about abnormal behaviour .	5
I know all the other teams laugh at me .	5
I know how that must feel .	5
I know how you feel , but don't ask me to do anything that'll break my heart .	5
I know how you feel .	5
I know I don't have to do it but I want to .	5
I know I'm being disrespectful to this honourable body ...	5
I know it's a terrible time .	5
I know that you need help , I know that I'm in no position to give it to you , - so , as your friend ...	5
I know that your life is here .	5
I know what it meant to you .	5
I know you think I'm crazy .	5
I know , [PERSON] , but ...	5,6
I know . I miss him too .	5
I left my home simply because I had to leave .	5
I live in one room for 8 , years and I'm tired of it .	5
I looked everywhere for my wife but couldn't find her .	5
I lost my head for a moment , but I couldn't help it .	5
I lost my place .	5
I loved him , but you know ...	5
I mean that all my life I've been nothing .	5
I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	5
I mean , it wasn't a bad little table .	5
I might not get you back this time .	5
I miss the time when I had you to myself every day .	5
I miss you too .	5
I mistakenly trusted these demons and slaughtered righteous officials To atone for my sins	5
I must be going senile .	5
I must come clean , though . I I had a man in my bed last night .	5
I must go .	5
I must have worn out your machine .	5
I must not get too close to women	5
I never had the chance to apologize to her .	5
I never see anything happen .	5
I never thought I'd find myself in that crowd .	5
I never thought I'd see the day . Will you move over June , I can't see my knockout of a granddaughter ?	5
I never wrote it .	5,6
I once went without food for 147 , days .	5
I only saw her when the family rented a farm in the summer .	5
I ought never to have married [PERSON] .	5
I promised myself when I get out of jail , I'm gonna find a Vago .	5
I promised your father I'd take care of you .	5
I read it in a report this morning and ...	5
I really am nice , but you act like a fool around me .	5
I really belong in jail .	5
I really liked him . I did .	5
I really missed you .	5
I remember very little of my childhood .	5
I said Because your husband is dead . 	5
I said to mama I don't feel good .	5
I saw an ad for a young lady that looked like she could have been or at least once a week .	5
I saw her just once more after that wedding night .	5
I saw it coming , but what could I do ?	5
I saw the little girl was hurt .	5
I screamed , but no one listened .	5
I see 'em walking around the streets depressed all the time .	5
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars ... and dreams of victory .	5
I shall always think about it .	5
I shall miss you too .	5
I should stay where I belong .	5
I shoulda listened to you .	5
I shouldn't have hit [PERSON] , shouldn't have picked up the telephone ...	5
I spent most of my life in institutions .	5
I still haven't recovered No energy to jump	5
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death .	5
I suppose that she forgot or he did not think that it might die .	5
I think an apology ...	5
I think I care too much .	5
I think I hurt him .	5
I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	5
I think some were stolen .	5
I think that I'm pretty enough , but I would not want to be that kind of star .	5,6
I think that people would stop looking at each other with a certain level of hostility , like , we do now .	5
I think the least people could do is to say they're sorry , or ... something .	5
I thought I could make a difference .	5
I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	5,6
I thought I was doing smart business .	5,6
I thought I was the best stud - poker player in the world .	5
I thought we were friends .	5
I told him my problem , I told him I loved you and he told me to keep my trap shut .	5
I told you , you're probably overworking yourself .	5
I took a sabbatical , and I traveled . But no matter where I went , The memory of that awful night	5
I tormented you with an old hatred that's no longer real .	5
I tried my best to make a man out of him ... but it look like I failed somewhere .	5
I tried one of them once , but she didn't show any enthusiasm at all .	5
I tried to enlist , they told them to me that I was too ancient .	5
I tried to make her care , but I couldn't .	5
I tried to make it easier for you .	5
I try to help , but he doesn't listen to me , and I've got my own grief to work through .	5
I understand .	5
I used to be popular , wasn't I , [PERSON] ?	5
I used to use my hands .	5
I wan na feel good about something sometime .	5
I want it the way it used to be .	5
I want to be alone .	5
I want to die in my own land , where Human Beings are buried in the sky .	5
I want to die .	5
I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this .	5
I wanted good things for you .	5
I wanted [LOCATION] , but I wasn't counting on it .	5
I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me .	5
I wanted to blame myself for my dad's drinking , for my mom's crying all the time and her emotional breakdown .	5
I wanted to let you know that the ambulance was late in getting away .	5
I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle .	5
I wanted to save the ship .	5
I was a child .	5
I was almost in tears .	5
I was ambitious then .	5
I was crazy with jealousy .	5
I was dreadful .	5
I was getting lonely upstairs , all by myself .	5
I was hoping for a miracle , and it didn't happen .	5
I was hoping you'd be spared all this .	5
I was in a really bad place .	5
I was just an ensign .	5
I was never really sure which one I got , nutrition or discipline .	5
I was not a good artist .	5
I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good .	5
I was running out of things to say .	5
I was so alone , and suddenly you were there .	5
I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble .	5
I was starting to miss the old [PERSON] , and now this has happened , and it just ... It feels ... it feels so final , you know ?	5
I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	5
I was the world's nicest guy , and they ruined my life for no reason .	5
I was too late .	5
I was very sick when I was a boy .	5
I was weak and tired , Listless , out of sorts , and ...	5
I was window - shopping in [LOCATION] , daydreaming about what I'd buy for her , if I had any money .	5
I wasn't looking where I was going .	5,6
I went crazy .	5
I went off because I gained like six pounds ,	5
I will . This isn't exactly comfortable for me . I know you wanted this job .	5
I wish I could believe that .	5
I wish I could have made her understand .	5
I wish I could share your confidence .	5
I wish I could stay .	5
I wish I had a nickel .	5
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	5
I wish I were free tonight .	5
I wish it had gone .	5
I wish it made me feel good too .	5
I wish you could spend some time with him .	5
I won't live long .	5
I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it .	5
I wonder if it isn't a curse to be wised up like you and me .	5
I would hate to commit myself without my compass .	5
I would have sent it to you , but I didn't know your address until today .	5
I wouldn't want him to think I'm not sympathetic .	5
I yielded once before and was practically never heard of again .	5
I , uh ...	5
I'd be so happy if that were really true , [PERSON] .	5
I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	5
I'd like your support .	5
I'd only mess that up too .	5
I'd rather be dead .	5
I'd rather take a whipping than mend fences .	5
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved .	5
I'd waited so long !	5
I'll always regret that I didn't .	5
I'll be sorry to leave Faith .	5
I'll have to write it all over again .	5
I'll miss that man .	5
I'll miss you .	5
It was damn stupid of me , wasn't it ?	5
It was Father's Day ... the last time I heard from her .	5
It was horrible for him .	5
It was my fault .	5
It was nobody's fault but my own .	5
It was our last evening together .	5
It was terrible . He screamed with fear .	5
It was utter chaos .	5
It wasn't about the money , it was just about the anger .	5
It will happen , as it does for all of us .	5
It would be a pity if you died , not me	5
It wouldn't have helped our case .	5
It wouldn't have worked .	5
It'll be broken by dinner .	5
It's a bit humiliating , always borrowing [PERSON]'s place .	5
It's a bitter substitute .	5
It's a fucking slaughter , Lieutenant .	5
It's a liability .	5
It's a lot of time , especially when it stands still with loneliness .	5
It's all I've got left .	5
It's all over , [PERSON] .	5
It's all so horrible , isn't it ?	5
It's all used notes .	5
It's also possible to look at this in , really , just a slightly different way , which is just as sad , maybe even sadder .	5
It's as empty as ashes .	5
It's been a long year .	5
It's called urban blight .	5
It's fine , just a little pain .	5
It's going to be a long night .	5
It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more .	5
It's hard being a dope fiend .	5
It's hard , this fight .	5
It's hard . Just tell me what you need .	5
It's horrible !	5
It's just not okay to be alone anymore .	5
It's just you know that sometimes ... Well , you're not wanted .	5
It's kind of sad , though . All that money and nobody to enjoy it .	5
It's like falling off a log .	5
It's moving back against the wall .	5
It's my fault .	5
It's no good .	5
It's not your fault the plane landed in [LOCATION] .	5
It's nothing . - Nothing at all .	5
It's over , [PERSON] .	5
It's pretty rough .	5
It's so remote I thought I would ... be safe there . I figured no one could find me .	5
It's terrible that bad things happen , and all we do is stand by and watch .	5
It's terrible what happened to him .	5
It's too depressing to think about .	5
It's too late for that , [PERSON] .	5
It's too late to think of him .	5
It's too stupid . Perhaps .	5
It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	5
It's worse than that .	5
It's , uh , I sold my stuff out . Besides I'm scratched up and ...	5
Jealousy can be destructive .	5
[PERSON] , it's just a disease .	5
JFK .	5
[PERSON] , the insurance is worthless now .	5
John , really , I was only trying to help you out , that's all .	5
[PERSON] was a girl and it seemed hopeless .	5
[PERSON]'s dead .	5
[PERSON] , will we be lonely tonight ?	5
Just after she stopped seeing me .	5
Just the usual complications that's all .	5
[PERSON] , I might have died a happy man .	5
l got lost .	5
[PERSON]'s divorce left him in a state of disorder .	5
Last night was not so good .	5
Last time I saw him , he threw up scrambled eggs out of his nose on the way to the library .	5
[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain .	5
Let go . All right .	5
Let it go down .	5
Let me me go somewhere else . I'm sick .	5
Let me tell you , young lady , it is never easy to be the son of a successful father .	5
Let's just say I'm chickenshit .	5
Let's keep this a perfect memory ... and someday this bitter ache shall pass , my sweet .	5
Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books .	5
Life back over there is hard .  	5
Like myself , it struggled blindly for the means to live .	5
Lincoln just ain't the same no more .	5
Listen , I've always returned favors , haven't I , [PERSON] ?	5
Listen , [PERSON] .	5
Little [PERSON]'s been so lonely ...	5
[PERSON] didn't say nothing ...	5
Lonesome picker and watch house will be the first two to come forward .	5
Look , I was a bit of an asshole .	5
Look , I'm sorry to drop by unannounced .	5
Look , it was great to see you again , okay ? I just --	5
Look , [PERSON] , I - I've known all along That you were stealing food and treasure .	5
Looking back ,	5
Looks like it's gonna be a long night .	5
Looks like the Lord sends me about every misery he can think of just to try my soul .	5
[PERSON] , I don't want to hear it .	5
Ma'am , I don't know how to put into words the sorrow I feel .	5
Ma'am , she's no longer a minor . There's nothing we can do . But , but , but .	5
May he rest in peace .	5
Maybe he's got the flu or something	5
Maybe I'm tired of one - night stands .	5
Maybe we've forgotten how to hope .	5
Maybe you should've told her you loved her . Maybe that was the way to make sure .	5
Maybe you're sorry you married me now , [PERSON] .	5
Maybe , but [PERSON] wasn't hunting medals .	5
Mayii : I had long since lost track Of the child [PERSON] .	5
Melancholy sight .	5
[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	5

My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	5
My wife , God rest her soul , died years ago to the day .	5
My wife , poor girl .	5
[PERSON] , I don't want to leave like this .	5
NCMEC has a slightly different view of its interactions with [PERSON] .	5
Neither the picture nor her career mean as much to her as being with her father in his time of need .	5
Never I will understand the women .	5
[PERSON] did everything he could , but they got away .	5
[PERSON] , listen to me .	5
No more .	5
No one asked her to worry about me ...	5
No one can help me .	5

Nothing can make up for the loss of your life savings ...	5
Nothing ever happens .	5
Nothing more .	5
Nothing . Nothing .	5
Nothing's ... ever right .	5
Now I know how a poor little guinea pig must feel .	5
Now I've really lost her .	5
Now it's all one big mess .	5
Now what good is all that ?	5
Now you know that the saddest thing in the world is life .	5
Now , then I find myself in [LOCATION] with no money .	5
Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	5
Now's not a good time .	5,6
O dear me .	5,6
Of course it's been a great trial to your patience , Father ... but think of the burden that it's been to me .	5
Oh , but I can't intrude .	5
Oh , Captain , you got to stop this .	5

Poor boy who made it , ex-cop .	5
Poor boy .	5
Poor [PERSON] never did have no luck with men .	5
Poor child .	5
Poor country ! You sold the [LOCATION] in a senseless war .	5
Poor darling .	5
Poor girl .	5
Poor lamb .	5
Poor lieutenant laker .	5
Poor man's [PERSON] .	5
Poor [PERSON] .	5
[PERSON] was a good man . Tough break .	5
Really ashamed of myself .	5
Remember when [PERSON] said when he was fighting sometimes , he'd fight so hard that he was thinking that he broke something inside ?	5
Remind me to ask you later why your kisses don't seem quite the same .	5
Right , because it's a long shot . You could never love me back .	5
Rocky , I'm sorry .	5
Rocky's hurt .	5
Ruby's been dead for 14 , years .	5
Say bye - bye , now . Bye to daddy .	5
[PERSON] , if you knew what I've gone through !	5
See what you can do ? You weren't even conscious then , for chrissake .	5,6
See , back then , a man's name was the same as his occupation .	5
Seems a shame to part company after all these years .	5
Seems like it takes a crisis to bring us together lately .	5,6
Seven passengers and two crewmen were killed .	5
She died trying to save my daughter .	5,6
She does though . Well , I should say my goodbyes .	5
She doesn't know .	5
She flipped and tried to kill herself .	5,6
She had long , beautiful brown hair and now she had very short , choppy red hair .	5,6
She had my finger , you know ...	5
She just seems , I don't know , lonely .	5
She never even went back to the room .	5
She said she's not in a head - space for a relationship , with everything that's going on in the world .	5
She seemed too restless , too tense , too withdrawn , and [PERSON] , when he wasn't looking at [PERSON] , he was watching [LOCATION] look at Maria .	5
She told about a mother who was full of hate , and how she got back the hate she gave .	5
She told me that you've been going through some things ... in your personal life .	5
She was a prisoner as I was , and he just heard that she's dead .	5
She was drowned , poor dear , while she was sailing near [LOCATION] .	5
She was very nervous when we left [LOCATION] .	5
She was worried about you .	5
She would be pained to hear you say that .	5
She'll never come back no more .	5
She's an unlucky driver .	5
She's been through enough .	5
She's down .	5
She's dying .	5
She's kind of lost .	5
She's never cared for me .	5
She's sad right now ?	5
She's upset about something .	5
She's very sick .	5
She's very unhappy .	5
She's won and I've lost .	5
Shot her , right outta the sky .	5
Simply no use trying .	5
Simply stated , [PERSON] , it means that you have suffered damage to the brain .	5
Since I'm a one - man show around here , I think I'll forgive myself this one time ...	5
Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid , and I'm still waiting for it .	5
So alone .	5
So be it . I will be the first corpse .	5
So he never saw her again ?	5
So here's the program . You're gonna tell me what is going on , and you're gonna tell me what ideas you have , if you have any .	5,6
So I say , l don't know . 	5
So I'm gonna be sayin' good night .	5
So much for old business .	5
So the police are extended giving the famous protection , for which we are justly proud in this country , for a finger , eh ?	5,6
So tired .	5
So when I see you having all these things that I didn't have , I , like , live through your eyes .	5
So you do not recognize me ?	5,6
So you don't know what happened .	5,6
So , I take it you've been busy .	5
So , I'm guessing you didn't find my dad .	5
Some of them are carved in stone , some of them men like [PERSON] put up there , so suckers like me could read them .	5
Some official's son got in trouble and they're looking for a substitute	5
Some people don't like my metaphors .	5
Something about a place called [PERSON] .  He's dying . 	5
Something went wrong .	5
Sometimes I think you don't even know I live here .	5
Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways .	5
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run .	5
Sometimes they have an accident .	5
Sometimes , as I'm falling asleep I can feel him breathing on my face and touching me with his hand .	5
Sorry about that .	5
Sorry about the Chiefs , [PERSON] .	5
Sorry about your finger .	5
Sorry I was suspicious .	5
Sorry more people weren't there to hear it .	5
Sorry you had to come back to something like this .	5
Sorry , [PERSON] , I didn't mean to scare you .	5
Sorry , boys .	5
Sorry , coach .	5
Sorry , nothin' but beer .	5
Sorry , [LOCATION] .	5
Sorry , pal .	5
Sorry , sister .	5
Sorry . - Sorry to wake you .	5
Sounds awful , doesn't it ?	5
Sounds tough .	5
Stop , wait !	5
Subject is violently antisocial given to delusions of godhood . And he's hopelessly addicted to narcotics .	5
Sunny [LOCATION] will not be that tomorrow .	5
Sweetheart , don't get personal .	5
Sweety , you're supposed to be beddy - byes !	5,6
Teddy never made it .	5
Tell him you're not going , tomorrow morning or ever .	5
Tell them it was all my fault .	5
Ten suicides there was last year , in one day .	5
Terribly disappointed . It's the last thing I owned .	5
Thank you , but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce .	5
That girl doesn't exist anymore .	5
That hurts .	5
That I knew how miserable you were with him ?	5
That just can't be .	5,6
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are .	5
That last part , there's something off about it .	5
That means he's flying it .	5,6
That seems a pity .	5
That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone .	5
That this could be the result of all I had committed my life to .	5
That was my low .	5
That was stupid and cruel .	5,6
That was the night [PERSON] went away .	5
That will be the toughest part .	5
That won't help you .	5
That'll clip your wings .	5
That's absurdly hypothetical .	5,6
That's horrible .	5
That's how wars start .	5
That's just my nature .	5
That's no way to remember him .	5
That's not good .	5
That's terrible .	5
That's the only chance you got left .	5
That's the unholy pity of it .	5
That's the way it's been your whole life .	5
That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life .	5
That's what always happens when people fall in love .	5
That's when mine broke up .	5
That's when they start to drift away .	5
The best died there .	5
The bite ... was mine .	5,6
The boat is gone .	5
The boy's doing so poor these days , why not take him along and air him ?	5
The brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised .	5
The cheque is no good .	5
The children of my world will have no more stories to read .	5
The death of [PERSON] is a tragedy .	5
The doc just looked at us and shook his head .	5
The drinking , the drugs , that's not a regular thing for me .	5,6
The fish that got away is always the biggest one .	5
The fun is over .	5
The girls have so little time .	5
The governor sounds unhinged .	5
The helicopter was destroyed , and the pilot is dead .	5
The kid hates me .	5
The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	5
The military has been mobilized , but the violence is so widespread that it is impossible for the rescue services to respond .	5
The moon's out , but there are clouds around .	5
The most damning testimony ... Comes from an abused and frightened child ... Who overcame his fear and his pain ...	5
The most horrible thing was , you'd smile when you were mad .	5
The moving finger had already writ and moved on , and nothing I could do would have canceled half a line , nor would my tears wash out a word of it .	5
The one that you and [PERSON] ditched .	5,6
The only place my parents ever mentioned coming from was overseas .	5
The other day , you looked like you were still hurting .	5
The people with the money in their hot little hands put her up there , and she could do no wrong .	5
The phone is dead .	5
The ponies were dying .	5
The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ?	5
The preparations for my departure ...	5
The queue was endless .	5
The rolling balls , the second - hand phrases , the migraine headaches ... Shirt - tails , and tonight's speech : I turned yellow but my dog likes me .	5
The same all grind week after week . And so much stress .	5
The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle .	5
The sea shall have you back .	5
The [PERSON] woman died today .	5
The trouble with me ? I'm not very good at looking ahead .	5
The truth is I wanted to quit .	5
The war in [LOCATION] .	5
The witness stand is a lonely place to lie .	5
The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it .	5
Their flowers are dead .	5
Their privilege , their presumption .	5,6
Then a wasp stung out my eye .	5
Then I lived in many European capitals , trying to forget something sad that happened long ago .	5
Then I went to the liquor store I grabbed a bottle , and I started drinking .	5
Then if you did get me well and I went to him , you wouldn't like it .	5
Then there were some who just got tired of living .	5
Then there's no hope .	5
Then there's nothing left for me .	5
Then what are you gonna come home to ?	5
Then , one night , we were talking about how we hated the life , and how we had never done much of anything ourselves .	5
Then , you have to go .	5
Then , you still believed you could make a difference .	5
Then , you'll want to say goodbye .	5
There are estimates out there that . million homeless kids are out on the street at any given time .	5
There are many who can not tell between good and evil	5
There is nothing I can do .	5
There isn't anything to do .	5
There must be something I can do .	5
There was no more innocence anywhere .	5
There was nothing that could be done for her , except wait .	5
There were some problems with ...	5
There . There .	5
There's been enough bloodshed already .	5
There's more bad ?	5,6
There's no escape .	5
There's no reason for me to be here .	5
There's no time ...	5
There's no way I can have this kind of exposure .	5,6
There's nobody left around here now .	5
There's not much we can do .	5
There's nothing else I can do .	5
There's nothing I can do about it .	5
There's nothing we can do .	5
There's nothing you can do .	5
There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	5
There's someone crying .	5
There's still places I want to see and things I want to do .	5
These are the wrong keys .	5,6
They always have that same look on their face ...	5
They are the tears of Old [LOCATION] .	5
They both fell .	5
They did the smash - and - grab , she was gonna tell the feds .	5
They didn't miss me at all .	5
They don't know themselves .	5,6
They failed .	5
They got away .	5
They got hard times as it is .	5
They had ten ... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck .	5
They had ...	5
They have lost the ability to communicate and reason .	5
They have no husbands and they cry .	5
They hold together and bring me bad luck .	5
They look like they've come to a funeral .	5
They meant nothing .	5
They mustn't get old .	5
They pay , got that ?	5
They probably will start crying .	5
They said I was crazy , so they sent me to a mental hospital .	5
They screwed him up .	5
They took his coat .	5,6
They tried .	5
They'd go to Congress and get more funding .	5
They're all dead .	5
They're blaming me for it .	5
They're gonna keep him in that foster home !	5
They're poorly !	5
They're pretty hopeless .	5
They've been kind enough .	5
Things like this create a bad feeling .	5
Think of the years of suffering , deprivation and hardship among those awful savages .	5
This cutter's broken .	5
This dying sticks in my mind and makes me poor company .	5
This has been a long week , Dr. [PERSON] .	5
This has been a terrible shock to them .	5
This hurts me in my heart .	5
This hurts , [LOCATION] .	5
This is a dreadful miscarriage .	5
This is a house of ill fame , and I'm a fallen flower .	5
This is a man's world , a brutal world .	5
This is a very sad day for me .	5
This is all I'm capable of right now .	5
This is awful .	5
This is crazy .	5,6
This is dreadful !	5
This is history .	5
This is not a good place for you .	5
This is not my day .	5
This is only the tip of the iceberg , as hundreds more have given us their testimony , but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families .	5
This is terrible .	5
This is the society we could have had a century ago .	5
This kid's cryin' , man .	5
This licence has expired .	5,6
This must be difficult , your life changing so drastically .	5
This strange coffee is a bore , but what can I do when I can't sleep ?	5
This time , in sight of my goal , it seemed as if I must meet defeat .	5
This was my bedroom .	5
This witness will testify about a bar glass . They have no bar glass .	5,6
This won't work .	5
Those were the last words she heard me say .	5
Though you may think you're having fun now you only hurt the one you love .	5
Three men killed , and to what end ?	5
Three of your neighbors were killed last night .	5
Three ships were lost , you know .	5
Time drags when you're tired .	5
To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honourable state .	5
To do this , we had to harden our hearts against the suffering outside .	5
To have to hear it in installments might prove unendurable .	5
To the squad . Are they detaining it , it is ?	5
To think of her struggles , her fruitless cries for help .	5
Toad's friends tried to help him , but were always blocked .	5
[PERSON] , will you ever get out from under Rocky's shadow ?	5
[PERSON] ...	5
Tomorrow , [PERSON] ... My friend and mentor , will testify he thinks I'm guilty .	5
Too bad the girls are in [LOCATION] .	5
Too little , too late .	5
Too many passengers , I'm afraid .	5
Too much so	5
Tough cop falls for beautiful murderess .	5,6
Tragic .	5
Truth of the matter is I don't much like parties .	5
Trying to make her think her husband is still alive .	5
Turns out my life hasn't been my own for the last years .	5
Tusk doesn't have any friends .	5
Twelve to fifteen percent of the kids we serve were victims of human trafficking .	5
Two destroyers hit by mines ...	5
Uh , here's , uh , here's this .	5,6
[PERSON] in office can cause damage .	5
Unfortunately for you and everybody in this room , his deals fell through because the market dried up .	5
Unfortunately , he couldn't find me .	5
Unfortunately , I have to return to my children now .	5
Unfortunately , Professor [PERSON] is dead .	5
Unhappy Brom , already bested at every turn , saw himself once more outmatched .	5
ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] 	5
Very well . I understand , doctor .	5
[PERSON] , I'm not interested in this . Of course you're not .	5
Wait ! His troops are still out there	5
Wasn't it hard to ... To live with yourself After completely wimping out	5
We ain't had a chance to get this place too nice .	5
We all have to sacrifice something .	5
We are not important .	5
We buried him the next day .	5
We can go to the Fairmont ...	5
We can't do this to him !	5
We can't just leave him here .	5
We can't keep riding with our stern to the wind .	5,6
We can't live with lies .	5
We can't . We were never together .	5,6
We could have backed him up .	5
We did not ditch . We were working .	5,6
We didn't have a mortgage .	5
We don't belong here .	5
We don't understand .	5
We had something special , but it's over .	5
We have to drop the case .	5
We have to save each other , because all victims are equal .	5
We haven't eaten yet .	5
We know you're sad , buddy , but you got ta go to school .	5
We live in a border state where a lot of this cross-border sex trafficking takes place .	5
We lost [PERSON] , go back !	5,6
We must have missed him .	5
We must leave tonight .	5
We never had a nursery , [PERSON] .	5,6
We owed a great deal of money and I had no job .	5
We spoke to police lieutenant [PERSON] laker at the scene this afternoon .	5
We tried that route , but we gave up .	5
We want to die !	5
We were all a part of what happened to her .	5
We were all praying for a miracle .	5
We were almost there and now all this is going to hold us up .	5
We were drilled like little soldiers .	5
We were just talking .	5
We were so very sorry about your father .	5
We won't leave this palace alive .	5
We'd have got married , had a house and children .	5
We'll miss the complimentary beverage .	5
We'll never be parted again	5
We'll never meat again	5
We'll say farewell to [PERSON]	5
We're all alone in this .	5
We're going now , and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again .	5
We're here to talk about the online lucrative sale of [LOCATION]'s children for sex , which in our experience occurs most prominently	5
We're home free .	5
We're in a war zone , [PERSON] : Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts .	5
We're looking at economic instability , we're looking at housing instability .	5
We're that kind of monster .	5
We're the minorities , man .	5
We've been working too hard .	5
We've got to keep ... Keep daddy happy .	5
We've lost our picture .	5
We've lost the baby's heartbeat .	5
We've no other choice .	5
Well , I didn't have the money .	5
Well , I don't know , Captain .	5,6
Well , I don't think I can do much , sir , but ...	5,6
Well , I find in a moment of anger follows a thousand nights of sorrow .	5
Well , I suppose I should thank you .	5
Well , I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life , that I was an outsider .	5
Well , I'm sure things must have been difficult with your parents passing .	5
Well , if he can ...	5
Well , if it's anyone's fault , I expect it's mine .	5
Well , it can't be helped now .	5
Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	5
Well , no wonder you're worn out .	5
Well , now there's no sunshine in my life .	5
Well , that's the problem . Um ... The bad guys took it .	5
Well , the least we can do for [PERSON] is find out what we can about [PERSON] .	5
Well , this misery in my back ... ain't so good .	5
Well , we're all sinners in here .	5
Well , you know , there wasn't much we could do .	5
Well , you're so much stronger than I am .	5
Were you close with the deceased ?	5
What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so .	5
What a shame .	5
What a waste of talent .	5
What bothers you ?	5
What did [PERSON] say to get you so upset ?	5
What difference would it make ?	5
What do you have ? What are you hiding ?	5,6
What he did was , he just took my money .	5,6
What I feel towards you I'll have to feel for the rest of my life .	5
What if an RD conks out ?	5
What if I just lean back like this ? Would you rescue me if I fell ?	5
What makes you think he'll listen to me ?	5
What that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .	5
What was your relationship with the deceased ?	5
What will happen to you after I've gone ? They like hearing my stories	5
What would you do if it was your child ?	5,6
What , it's over ?	5,6
What's the use of getting excited , [PERSON] ?	5
Whatever I was , that was a long time ago .	5
When an hour alone with you was an impossibility .	5
When did he die ?	5,6
When he held me , it wasn't the way a father should hold a daughter .	5
When I got back to the hotel , I couldn't sleep .	5
When I think of that kid , I want to cry .	5
When I was a little girl , like so many others , there was no money to buy shoes for me ,	5
When I'm wearing a new bonnet ... all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head .	5
When [PERSON] got seriously ill , you sent her to a home .	5
When [PERSON] died , [PERSON] was only five .	5
When she left me , I lost all pride .	5
When they looked back , they saw the body of Little Man lie down among his friends .	5
When was the last time you saw her ?	5
When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	5
When you listen to the evidence , ask yourselves ... Why [PERSON] ... The finest prosecutor of this county ...	5
Where are you taking it ? - To the hospital .	5,6
Whereas when you scratch the apprentice kid ,	5,6
Which , incidentally , the worst day of my life .	5
Who - Who ? Who's sick ?	5,6
Why are you crying , Mistress [PERSON] ?	5
Why can't I play with you ?	5
Why can't we have pancakes ?	5
Why did you choose Chipping Sodbury ? There is a convent there !	5,6
Why did you do it ?	5,6
Why didn't you tell me ?	5,6
Why didn't you write to me ?	5
Why do you bother with her , eh ? She's nothing but trouble .	5
Why do you stand or sit as far away from me as possible ?	5
Why do you want to die , Grandfather ?	5
Why do you want to shut me out in the cold like this ?	5
Why don't I do this right ?	5
Why don't you just go ?	5,6
Why don't you let me help you ?	5,6
Why is she crying ?	5,6
Why won't you let me help you ?	5
Why , her last words were about you .	5
[PERSON] , don't look so unhappy .	5
With a baby , you never know what you're getting .	5
Without you , [PERSON] .	5
Woman's work is never done .	5
Won't admit that it exists .	5,6
Would you call me [PERSON] ?	5
Yeah , all right , you got a lot goin' .	5
Yeah , but he's not gonna take me along any more , is he ?	5
Yeah , ever since , uh , [PERSON] joined the firm , he's been trying to marry me off .	5
Yeah , he was a good soldier .	5
Yeah , I sure feel sorry for you , [LOCATION] .	5
Yeah , I'd like to burn it out of my mind .	5
Yeah , I'm afraid it is , [PERSON] .	5
Yeah , my veneer popped off , yeah sucks .	5
Yeah , probably he don't gonna run , which I don't name him a top jock to ride him .	5
Yeah , she was my girl .	5
Yes , but that doesn't ...	5,6
Yes , I guess it's been a nightmare for you too .	5
Yes , I noticed you'd packed .	5
Yes , I was always afraid as a child .	5
Yes , I'm afraid I was misquoted .	5,6
Yes , it'll be a pity if this doesn't come off , too .	5
Yes , [PERSON] found him slumped over his desk that morning ...	5
Yes , Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning ...	5
Yes , sir , I still have the scars .	5
Yes , sir , my apologies .	5
Yes . I'd never have guessed .	5
Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day .	5
You ain't got no place to go , [PERSON] .	5
You and [PERSON] just weren't right for each other .	5
You are going to get us all killed If you keep on antagonizing him .	5,6
You are quite right , and I do not have the right , but I do love [PERSON] .	5
You came as an enemy to destroy me .	5
You can at least , for Christ's sake ... lie to me .	5
You can shoot us now .	5
You can stay at my house because nobody really cares about me .	5
You can't afford this .	5,6
You can't blame them , can you ?	5
You can't kill him .	5
You can not come to the hospital , [LOCATION] .	5
You can not tolerate the faith in humanity , Because if you do , all this ... The structure of your very existence ,	5
You changed that , and you can't change it back .	5
You could call me a freak of nature .	5
You deserve the worst for what you did .	5
You did or did not get those records ? - I did not .	5,6
You didn't come to my wedding .	5
You didn't tell us ?	5,6
You disapprove , sir ?	5,6
You do look pale .	5
You don't care about me .	5
You don't care whether I live or die .	5
You don't have to say the words , Governor .	5
You don't like me very much , do you ?	5
You don't like me , do you ?	5
You don't like to see me enjoying myself .	5
You don't look excited .	5
You don't really think I don't want you to do well ? No , [PERSON] .	5
You don't remember , do you ?	5,6
You don't seem very excited about it .	5
You don't sound very grateful , Dr. Blood .	5
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at , feet , straight and level over some farm country ? I mean , come on , sir .	5
You don't want us to drink ourselves to sleep .	5
You go ahead and let the grieving process happen .	5
You gonna cry , [PERSON] ?	5
You got one bad seed there .	5,6
You got ta fix this mess , be it how you fix it with your girl , or how you fix it with [PERSON] , cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this .	5,6
You got ta settle down or you're gonna wake him up .	5,6
You hadn't had much contact with her , then ?	5,6
You hate him ....	5,6
You hate me .	5
You have our deepest sympathy .	5
You have to go on the road and I have to go through what I'm going through .	5
You hurt his feelings .	5
You insist on putting me into a position that I don't in the least relish .	5
You keep avoiding me .	5
You knew how I felt .	5
You know how I loved her , really .	5
You know I talk to it sometimes , and I beg it to wake me up .	5,6
You know I've never been able to give you very much .	5
You know too much .	5,6
You know , all fairness to alcohol , I've done stupid things when I was sober , too .	5,6
You know , because you think of generals , and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business .	5,6
You know , I still expect him to come home for dinner .	5
You know , I wanted to blame myself for that .	5
You know . sometimes it feels like it's the only thing keeping us together .	5,6
You look a thousand years old .	5
You look like death .	5
You look tired , Little Big Man .	5
You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action ... day in and day out .	5
You mean you don't love him anymore ?	5
You mean , Dad's not coming home anymore ?	5
You meet somebody and you only got one night to really get to know them .	5
You might have noticed I've got a slight weight problem .	5
You must forgive me .	5
You must get lonely .	5
You must have loved your [PERSON] .	5
You must love someone else .	5

You see . we're not like you think we are .	5,6
You spent $ , at The Capital Grille ?	5,6
You suffered severe brain trauma .	5
You think I killed her .	5
You think it was me that beat you ?	5
You think that by saying ,  I'm sorry ,  all the past can be corrected .	5
You think you should have done something different but it's not your fault that [PERSON] died .	5
You told me that when you overwork you get nervous and lose weight .	5
You were getting over your broken heart .	5
You will hate me now .	5
You won't get him .	5
You won't stay here , and I can't go with you .	5
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here .	5
You , too , think I am too old , too ugly for a man to look upon with love .	5
You'd hate it .	5
You'll go on without me .	5
You'll lose your hair .	5
You'll see a puff of smoke from my exhaust when I cut in the motor . That's when you hit the magic button .	5
You're all I ever had .	5
You're blacking out , waking up in places you don't remember , bleeding from where you were shot .	5
You're fired , [PERSON] .	5
You're going bald too .	5
You're good , but you're taking on a lot .	5
You're just being used , you know .	5
You're just saying that .	5
You're killing me .	5
You're like another person .	5
You're not that person anymore .	5
You're right . He has turned against me .	5
You're wasting your time with me . I'm nothing .	5
You've forgotten , this is the th century .	5
You've never known .	5
Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day .	5
Your mom and I won't be very long .	5
Your mom wasn't ... well , and she needed time to recover , to get better .	5
Your opinion is that this was ... A staged rape ?	5,6

How are we to answer this , [PERSON] and I ?	6

How did [PERSON] and the newspapers get the [PERSON] story before you ?	6
How did the trust fund end up in [PERSON]'s name in the first place ?	6

How did you find that out ?	6
How did you get here ?	6
How did you get in here ?	6
How did you know about that ?	6
How did you know I was here ?	6
How did you know my name ?	6
How did you learn to fight like that ?	6
How did you manage to get so friendly with [PERSON] ?	6
How did you pull that ? What do you got ...	6
How did you recognise me , Mr [PERSON] ?	6
How do they explain a man walking around with his neck broken ?	6
How do you know all that ?	6
How do you know how to do all of this ?	6
How do you know it's not you .	6
How do you live with it , Miss [PERSON] ?	6
How great can you kiss ?	6
How they handle all this and ride a horse at the same time is beyond me .	6
How ?	6
How'd they know you were on this train ?	6
How'd you boys know where to find me ?	6
How'd you find us ?	6
Hsiao - tsing ? !	6
Hundred dollars a night ?	6
Hundreds !	6
I am a clown , and puzzled only by his presence in a place such as this , among such people as us .	6
I and [PERSON] we were already , and I would not believe so fast in someone I eat in him . I am not wrong , he has something in the sleeve .	6
I appreciate your patience .	6
I beg your pardon ?	6
I can be president of the [LOCATION] !	6
I can see that !	6
I can't believe it myself .	6
I can't believe it was you on the phone .	6
I can't believe it .	6
I can't believe that .	6
I can't believe this is you , [PERSON] .	6
I can't believe this . I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper .	6
I can't remember . - You can't remember ?	6
I did a catalogue with his names and residences .	6
I didn't even recognize her .	6
I didn't expect to be called to see the admiral , sir .	6
I didn't expect to see you , Mrs. [PERSON] .	6
I didn't jump .	6
I didn't know I had one .	6
I didn't know we were on a first - name basis , but how are you ?	6
I didn't know you played a saxophone .	6
I didn't know you were a music aficionado .	6
I didn't know you were married .	6
I didn't know you were still here .	6
I didn't marry her under my real name .	6
I didn't recognize you standing up .	6
I didn't think you'd shoot .	6
I discovered that actually [PERSON] was not in [LOCATION] ... when the storm of battle broke .	6
I do not even know who you are .	6
I don't believe it ! He was down and out and finished !	6
I don't believe it .	6
I don't believe what we have done .	6
I don't know if he was a good man or if he was a bad man .	6
I don't know these sailboats .	6
I don't know what it is	6
I don't know what to say .	6
I don't know , the words just slipped out .	6
I don't mean to be handing you no line , but that's pretty hard to believe .	6
I don't mind it if you call me [PERSON] , you know .	6
I don't see any native girls hungry for affection .	6
I don't think I've seen you before .	6
I don't understand . You're already married .	6
I don't want this !	6
I find this hard to say without sounding condescending , but I'm proud of you .	6
I forgot who I was .	6
I got a man here that sailed on the Golden Arrow And lived to tell about it .	6
I guess [PERSON]'s got more sense than both of us .	6
I guess that's why the old man gave it to you !	6
I had no idea !	6
I hadn't heard you'd sold the place .	6
I have to go now .	6
I haven't been up this early in years .	6
I haven't seen you around their office , though .	6
I haven't seen you for a week .	6
I haven't seen you for days .	6
I hope you don't mind my asking , and , believe me , I'm thrilled that you did , but why did you accept a blind date ?	6
I just didn't believe it .	6
I just got wised up to something funny the last few days .	6
I just had the weirdest dream .	6
I just happen to be taking the same train .	6
I just saved your life , and you still don't trust me ?	6
I killed this person for their money , right ?	6
I know him .	6
I like the bubble . - Yeah ?	6
I mean , if our system wasn't any good , why did they take us over in the first place , right ?	6
I might do that .	6
I must have been crazy .	6
I never imagined what was a work for woman .	6
I never know in advance when I'm going to be a genius .	6
I never mentioned any illness .	6
I never scouted this neighborhood .	6
I never thought I'd make it .	6
I never thought of it ...	6
I never thought of that , sir .	6
I noticed an enormous difference between [PERSON]'s projected figures and the ones off the extro - budget in the [LOCATION] market .	6
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	6
I request a recess .	6
I said , [PERSON] , you're already married .	6
I saw it , but I didn't believe it .	6
I saw the same book in her room .	6
I see that it's funny .	6
I sent you all those letters .	6
I should be back in [LOCATION] , sitting in front of a typewriter , making all this up for a movie .	6
I sit here and I can't believe that it happened .	6
I think so . Sure . Um ...	6
I though you didn't like blood sports .	6
I thought communications were out .	6
I thought he didn't drink .	6
I thought he didn't have any trusted friends except you .	6
I thought he was kidding .	6
I thought he was sick .	6
I thought I gave you plenty of time to ...	6
I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you .	6
I thought I was someone who I wasn't .	6
I thought it was all over .	6
I thought it was the old man's	6
I thought politics interested you .	6
I thought that was you .	6
I thought they said they was from [LOCATION] .	6
I thought they were with [PERSON] .	6
I thought you said she got on the helicopter .	6
I thought you said something .	6
I thought you were a confirmed private .	6
I thought you were fast asleep .	6
I thought you were getting fatter , Mama !	6
I thought you were supposed to eat fish on a Friday .	6
I thought you were ...	6
I thought you weren't a romantic .	6
I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow .	6
I thought you wouldn't see [PERSON] now you're back with [PERSON] .	6
I thought you'd be happy .	6
I thought you'd be old .	6
I thought you'd be thrilled to death .	6
I thought you'd gone .	6
I thought you'd question him .	6
I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing .	6
I thought your favourite was chicken .	6
I thought your little cousin was going to sell the stock .	6
I understand perfectly .	6
I understand ! You're provoking me into hitting you	6
I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 , acres .	6
I was just calling because I'm having a game night .	6
I was lucky I come across her last .	6
I wonder what he's doing with Mr [PERSON] .	6
I wonder what he's got against the marines ?	6
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect .	6
I wouldn't have believed it .	6
I wouldn't think of such a thing !	6
I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	6
I'd always heard how badass you Grimms were , but your mother was a complete letdown .	6
I'd have to lead them through .	6
I'd offer you something harder , but you don't drink ?	6
I'll be damned .	6
I'll be surprised . What about years ?	6
I'm actually beginning to like them .	6
I'm always getting winked at these days .	6
I'm impressed .	6
I'm not playing games right now .	6
I'm pregnant , you know .	6
I'm sorry , I'm conducting an examination .	6
I'm sorry , ma'am , but you're needed in the Situation Room .	6
I'm surprised at you !	6
I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday .	6
I've been called a lot of things , but  comfortable  !	6
I've been looking everywhere for you .	6
I've never been invisible before .	6
I've never done anything like that before in my life .	6
I've never seen anything like it before .	6
I've never seen such activity .	6
I've seen him !	6
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to [LOCATION] ...	6
If he is to be sacrificed before [PERSON] , why is he not painted red ?	6
If I'd only known , I'd have come straight home .	6
If not [PERSON] , who is it ?	6
If that's all what we all thinking , why isn't someone just come right out and say it ?	6
If you find any keys , hang on to them .	6
Impossible !	6
In charge of piers and warehouses ?	6
In her medicine cabinet ?	6
In other words , you don't know ?	6
Incredible !	6
Incredible .	6
Intriguing young lady , Miss [PERSON] .	6
Is Backpage an innocent facilitator or do they actually have a more active role in fashioning the kinds of ads that are actually being placed ?	6
Is he always like that ?	6
Is he really our cousin ?	6
Is it for this that you hold me back from a raid on [LOCATION] ?	6
Is it real ? Is it real pig ?	6
Is it really him ?	6
Is it supposed to work right away ?	6
Is it true the ballet's moving out ?	6
Is she the one in the painting ?	6
Is that chilli ?	6
Is that right ?	6
Is that so far from your desire ?	6
Is that true ?	6
Is that what this is ?	6
Is that what you want ?	6
Is that what you wanted ?	6
Is that what you're worried about ?	6
Is that why I had to come alone ?	6
Is this absolutely where you live , my dearest one ?	6
Is this how it goes ?	6
Is this our new car ?	6
Is this [PERSON] , who we went to [LOCATION] with ?	6
Is this some sort of a gag ?	6
Is this the time , or I am blind ?	6
Is this Truth or Dare ? Say what ?	6
Isabel , you look very lovely tonight .	6
Isn't that a dog up there ?	6
Isn't that the truth ?	6
Isn't that what this is all about ?	6
Isn't that what we planned for six months in your bedroom ?	6
Isn't there a guard ?	6
Isn't this a school day ?	6
Isn't this about professionalism ?	6
Isn't this the same desk ... ?	6
It astonished me .	6
It is nothing like we figured out .	6
It looks better on you .	6
It looks different here .	6
It must have been here all day .	6
It sounds ridiculous , but the soldiers never lifted a hand to stop us .	6
It stung at first , but now I can't feel a thing .	6
It was fine . You've been away all this time ?	6
It was the only game I could find where I wasn't holding markers on somebody .	6
It was , uh , bound in human flesh , inked in blood .	6
It wasn't even loaded .	6
It wasn't something that we could see , it wasn't in the paper .	6
It's a belt that makes its wearer invisible .	6
It's a CIT ?	6
It's a glitch in your system .	6
It's a little foggy that you're pissed about 'cause I thought -- ´	6
It's a miracle they lasted as long as they did .	6
It's a miracle .	6
It's a new car .	6
It's a one - way street !	6
It's a whole new deal .	6
Now , this man is good .	6
Now , what's this About your having a religious problem ?	6
Now's your chance , go !	6
Of course , a box !	6
Of course , it's absurd that a priest would be involved .	6
Oh my God ! This is like romantical .	6
Oh my God ! You guys are all a bunch of freaks .	6
Oh , come on , it's just a joke .	6
Oh , did I ? Uh , I am .	6

She's in labor now ?	6
She's not taking that .	6
She's pregnant ?	6
She's pretty full on .	6
She's two hundred years old .	6
Silly , it never occurred to me .	6
Since you're sitting in the corner . You're usually a power table kind of girl .	6
Six months ago , who'd have thought we'd be spending Christmas together ?	6
Smuggle their manuscripts out to the [LOCATION] ?	6
So how can you tell the difference ?	6
So it really is the same old [PERSON] that we all knew and loved .	6
So that's what those things are for .	6
So that's what you came to see me about ?	6
So that's where the old raunch kept his stash !	6
So there really is someone named [PERSON] -[PERSON] !	6
So why didn't you invite [PERSON] ?	6
So you don't think that's funny ?	6
So you're behind all this .	6
So you're [PERSON] .	6
So , a rose is not a rose , and an umbrella has nothing to do with rain .	6
So , how is it you know so little about cars ?	6
So , I can not imagine , my dear [PERSON] , why you should wish to involve yourself .	6
So , I heard you we're going to propose to [PERSON] in some theme park .	6
So , what can I do for you ?	6
So , you're a lawyer now ?	6
Some unidentified walk - in is telling us the Russians are way behind , they can't hurt us , we can pull in our horns .	6

Someone we know ?	6
Someone's shown up to bail the city out .	6
Something about your mother .	6
Something very unusual has happened .	6
Something's happened to the dog .	6
Sometimes , in the middle of the night , I sit up and wonder where I am .	6
Sounds great , but what is it ?	6
Strange men , you mean ?	6
Strelnikov is dead . - What ?	6
Styles Court is even glorious !	6
Suck on that . Hey , who's there ?	6
Suppose I could prove it to you . Suppose I asked you for your help . Would you give it to me , without telling anybody , not saying anything to anyone ?	6
Sure I do .	6
Take all the time in the world , Barley .	6
Talk what things over ?	6
Tell me what [PERSON] was doing with a bribery file .	6

That only took two seconds .	6
That surprises me even more .	6

That was close .	6
That was his wife's plantation ?	6
That was my girl . Wait .	6
That was some road trip .	6
That !	6
That'd be great . Thank you .	6
That's a big surprise .	6
That's a hell of a story , Bell .	6
That's a lot of love , to give up the money he's making .	6
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	6
That's a twist . - Oh , a fruit twist ?	6
That's a weapon in your world ?	6
That's all ?	6
That's confusing the issue .	6
That's incredible .	6
That's not bad for a blind man .	6
That's not judge [PERSON] .	6
That's not unusual .	6
That's odd .	6
That's right , $ , .	6
That's some ride , huh ?	6
That's some sign you got on the door out there .	6
That's strange , my brother can't drive like that .	6
That's the biggest pot yet .	6
That's the boy wonder ?	6
That's the first encouraging thing you've said .	6
That's very rare .	6
That's why I couldn't remember anything on Saturday .	6
That's why you brought me here ?	6
The back door !	6
The Belgian of the village ?	6
The best ! - Mr. [PERSON] !	6
The bus , the bus !	6
The chauffeur ? The stable boy ?	6
The creatures were about uh , four foot .	6
The defence has an interesting point .	6

The old man was right after all !	6
The President doesn't know it's occurring .	6
The princess has been acting very strangely .	6
The ring !	6
The stewardess is flying the plane ?	6
The suspect's body , who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copycat , was discovered late last night .	6
The things are walking fast , my friend . Perhaps fast too much .	6
The tree is alive ?	6
The woman that let her in swears your secretary told her she was with the National Transportation Safety Board .	6
Then again , you never can tell .	6
Then he was relieved unjustly ?	6
Then why are you hanging around here ?	6
Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there ?	6
Then , suddenly , I vomited on my family . Hmm .	6
Theoretically , it should have a much greater effect .	6
There are you , free to come and go as you please , and you choose to stay here .	6
There I was , face to face with [PERSON] .	6
There is something strange about that boy !	6
There ought to be some ...	6
There she sat , gazing at me with her big eyes .	6
There they are , they must have found her !	6
There's a airplane on you . - You drew an airplane on me ?	6
There's a shitload of that .	6
There's a wireless in this hut , sir .	6

There's somebody out there .	6
They are wise , these old women !	6
They don't know he's here , do they ?	6

They told me you had a wine cellar , but I didn't believe it .	6
They told me you wouldn't see me .	6
They took [PERSON]'s body ? He can't even bury her ?	6
They wouldn't let you take your dog ?	6
They're real , aren't they ?	6
They're unbelievable .	6
